1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've got that wanderlust, I'm gonna walk the scene

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We will get back to this buddy at the end of the video

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But before that I want to tell you about the Summer of Math Exposition number 2

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So last year we did the Summer of Math Exposition number 1

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Which was essentially an open invitation for people to make explanatory math content

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That they might have thought about making before

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But just get an excuse for us to all do it at the same time and together

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The way we did it is we framed it as a contest

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we had different participants, a lot of them were videos, not all of them were videos

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We had a process for selecting winners

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And aside from the competition aspect of it

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Which is really just an excuse to have a deadline and have that little extra push to try to make something as good as you can

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The most exciting part was just how many really solid pieces of content came out of that

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In fact I was curious the other day and I went to look at the analytics and just looking at the video content

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Really because that's where it's easiest to count the total number of hits on it

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of all of the video submissions to the first Summer of Math Exposition

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If we count up all the views that they accumulated

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's over 15 million total views there

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we want to do it again

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you have some kind of math explainer that you've been thinking about making and posting online in some capacity

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Whatever that is

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And if you want to use the summer as an excuse to make it happen

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There are really just 3 main bits of logistics

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Number 1

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Subscribe to the official mailing list that we're going to use for it

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All of the official communication about things like timelines, rules for submissions, answers to any questions that people might have had

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All of it's going to live there

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Secondly the submission deadline is August 15th

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So try to finish whatever you're making maybe 5 days before that

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because we have to be immovable with some kind of line

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And August 15th is going to be that line

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And then if you want to engage with other people who are also participating in the event

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Maybe share some of your work or get some feedback or just chat about math in general

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's a Discord for it

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This year the Discord was really the lifeblood of the whole event

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We had the announcement, we had the choosing of the winners

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But all of the real community components of it happened on that Discord in between

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But with this year I also wanted to add one tiny little twist to the whole event

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I've always thought it might be nice to somehow play matchmaker between domain experts

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
People like mathematicians or professors of other kinds

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Or teachers or professionals

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The people who have the know-how and the experience with respect to some technical topic

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They know the best stories to tell

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But maybe they don't have the time to actually put together a video

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or they don't have the video making skills and content creation skills

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And then pair them together with content producers

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Whether that's people who are really interested in making videos, video editing, animation

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Or maybe web developers interested in interactive blog posts

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Game developers, artists, whatever the form of content creation might be

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because if you limit your scope to the world of online educational content creation by individuals

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have to live in this little intersection here

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Between the people who have good lessons to teach

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then the people who have the time and the interest

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then the technical know-how to put together that content

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But with well-organized collaboration

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can get a lot of good content out of the union of those two sets

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Rather than just the intersection

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I think a shining example of this would be the entire channel Numberphile

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where you've got Brady, who's a very talented journalist and interviewer and film creator, videographer

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And he goes and interviews the various experts out there

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And a lot of the experts wouldn't be making their own videos

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But by pairing together with Brady they get a really polished and well thought out product from it all

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Another interesting example of a collaboration like this one is

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me see, what was it called?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How to construct a leech lattice

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's on the channel for Richard Borcherds

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who's a Fields Medalist mathematician

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who makes a lot of his own videos

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Just kind of overhead shot lectures

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But this one was a partnership with someone who went in and took one of those lectures

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But added some animations and visuals on top

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To really help clarify what was being said

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because the whole thing is about lattices in 24 dimensions

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Which is hard to picture

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a very pleasing construction of them

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Which is both described and illustrated very beautifully

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And to incentivize more collaborations like that one

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We've put together a simple space to help people find collaborators

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
More on that in a moment

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And then at least one of the winners that we choose this year

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Will be from the set of people who've found a collaborator in this way

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And also I will throw my hat into this bunch

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And try to partner with some of the people in that space

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
To maybe make a 3Blue1Brown video

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So the way this will work

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Might look a little bit weird at first

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But bear with me

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We've set up a GitHub repo

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And we're going to use GitHub issues on that repository

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As a way of organizing requests for collaboration

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So let's say you're a mathematician

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have some idea for a good piece of expository content

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Maybe it's a video you think should get made

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Or an interactive blog post

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But you want to find someone to help you actually carry it out

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You would go and create a new issue

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You would use the template for a topic seeking a producer

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And then you just fill it out with all the details of your idea

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And the more details the better

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's say I was going to partner with some mathematician to produce something

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I would be interested in seeing a pretty good outline of the idea

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Why it's important, maybe even a storyboard in there

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then on the flip side

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you want to produce some kind of content

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know you're an artist or an animator or a video creator

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But you're more interested in getting content ideas from the experts

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Than from yourself

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You would also create an issue

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Use the producer seeking topic template

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And then fill that out

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So then if you're looking for a collaborator

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So let's say I'm going there

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm looking for mathematicians with interesting ideas

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or artists and animators that I might want to work with

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can take a look at all of the open issues

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And the reason for using GitHub for this

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Even though that might feel a little bit weird

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is that the tools seem right for what we want

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In terms of having a dedicated conversation

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For each thread

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Having nice math embedding in each one of them

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Making it easy to link between them

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And once you've found your collaborator

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And you're no longer looking for one

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can close the issue

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If that's a totally wild way to do it, feel free to complain at me

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But for my part at least, over the next week or two

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll be in there, I'll take a look through what the requests for collaboration are

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think it would be fun, for me at least

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To find some domain expert

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
With an interesting topic that I wouldn't have known to produce

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And then I was thinking of also finding someone

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who's interested in content creation

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Seems like they have at least a little bit of a portfolio

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Such that I can tell if the style would mesh well

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
With whatever topic from the domain expert I end up finding

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And then I would be there as a kind of producer

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And extra collaborator

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And we could post the final product on 3Blue on Brown

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And so that's the added twist

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But other than that, same deal as last year

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Again this time we'll choose at least five different winners

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And again, Brilliant has generously offered to contribute

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
$5,000 for prizes to the winners

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So we'll give $1,000 to each winner

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And then we'll be able to get a $1,000 prize

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For each winner

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Also, this year, slightly different twist

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Each winner will be sent a golden pie creature

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of which only five exist in the whole world

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So if that's not enough to get you to contribute

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know what will

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Other than that, again, all of the official details

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are in the email list

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Take a look at that first post to get all the details

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That I probably forgot to mention in this video

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And honestly, I'm really excited to see what people make

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thanks for watching!
