1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
I've got that wanderlust, I'm gonna walk the scene

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,760
We will get back to this buddy at the end of the video

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,120
But before that I want to tell you about the Summer of Math Exposition number 2

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,380
So last year we did the Summer of Math Exposition number 1

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,440
Which was essentially an open invitation for people to make explanatory math content

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
That they might have thought about making before

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,020
But just get an excuse for us to all do it at the same time and together

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,760
The way we did it is we framed it as a contest

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,180
So we had different participants, a lot of them were videos, not all of them were videos

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,980
We had a process for selecting winners

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,560
And aside from the competition aspect of it

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,660
Which is really just an excuse to have a deadline and have that little extra push to try to make something as good as you can

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,940
The most exciting part was just how many really solid pieces of content came out of that

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,660
In fact I was curious the other day and I went to look at the analytics and just looking at the video content

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,520
Mainly because that's where it's easiest to count the total number of hits on it

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,780
Of all of the video submissions to the first Summer of Math Exposition

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,980
If we count up all the views that they accumulated

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,700
It's over 15 million total views there

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,620
So we want to do it again

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,240
If you have some kind of math explainer that you've been thinking about making and posting online in some capacity

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,120
Whatever that is

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,620
And if you want to use the Summer as an excuse to make it happen

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,020
There are really just three main bits of logistics

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,940
Number 1, subscribe to the official mailing list that we're going to use for it

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,520
All of the official communication about things like timelines, rules for submissions, answers to any questions that people might have had

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,680
All of it's going to live there

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,940
Secondly, the submission deadline is August 15th

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,180
So try to finish whatever you're making maybe 5 days before that

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,780
Because we have to be immovable with some kind of line

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,940
And August 15th is going to be that line

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,780
And then if you want to engage with other people who are also participating in the event

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,900
Maybe share some of your work or get some feedback or just chat about math in general

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,640
There's a Discord for it

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,520
And last year the Discord was really the lifeblood of the whole event

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,000
I mean, we had the announcement, we had the choosing of the winners

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,980
But all of the real community components of it happened on that Discord in between

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,400
But with this year I also wanted to add one tiny little twist to the whole event

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,020
So I've always thought it might be nice to somehow play matchmaker between domain experts

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,040
People like mathematicians or professors of other kinds

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,200
Or teachers or professionals

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,800
The people who have the know-how and the experience with respect to some technical topic

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,500
They know the best stories to tell

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,620
But maybe they don't have the time to actually put together a video

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,180
Or they don't have the video-making skills and content creation skills

45
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,900
And then pair them together with content producers

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,860
Whether that's people who are really interested in making videos, video editing, animation

47
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,340
Or maybe web developers interested in interactive blog posts

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,480
Game developers, artists, whatever the form of content creation might be

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Because if you limit your scope to the world of online educational content creation by individuals

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,820
You have to live in this little intersection here

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,620
Between the people who have good lessons to teach

52
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,940
And then the people who have the time and the interest

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,920
And then the technical know-how to put together that content

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,960
But with well-organized collaboration

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,280
You can get a lot of good content out of the union of those two sets

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,580
Rather than just the intersection

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,500
And I think a shining example of this would be the entire channel number file

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,060
Where you've got Brady, who's a very talented journalist and interviewer and film creator, videographer

59
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,200
And he goes and interviews the various experts out there

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,920
And a lot of the experts wouldn't be making their own videos

61
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,680
But by pairing together with Brady they get a really polished and well-thought-out product from it all

62
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,780
Another interesting example of a collaboration like this one is

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,580
Let me see, what was it called?

64
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,180
How to construct a leech lattice

65
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,320
It's on the channel for Richard Borcherds

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,920
Who's a Fields Medalist mathematician

67
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,840
Who makes a lot of his own videos

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,540
Just kind of overhead shot lectures

69
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,020
But this one was a partnership with someone who went in and took one of those lectures

70
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,360
But added some animations and visuals on top

71
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,200
To really help clarify what was being said

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,760
Because the whole thing is about lattices in 24 dimensions

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
Which is hard to picture

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,300
It's a very pleasing construction of them

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,640
Which is both described and illustrated very beautifully

76
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,380
And to incentivize more collaborations like that one

77
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,360
We've put together a simple space to help people find collaborators

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
More on that in a moment

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,720
And then at least one of the winners that we choose this year

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,320
Will be from the set of people who've found a collaborator in this way

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,800
And also I will throw my hat into this bunch

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
And try to partner with some of the people in that space

83
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,220
To maybe make a 3Blue1Brown video

84
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,120
So the way this will work

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,900
Might look a little bit weird at first but bear with me

86
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,660
We've set up a GitHub repo

87
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,420
And we're going to use GitHub issues on that repository

88
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,520
As a way of organizing requests for collaboration

89
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,900
So let's say you're a mathematician

90
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,060
You have some idea for a good piece of expository content

91
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,140
Maybe it's a video you think should get made

92
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,800
Or an interactive blog post

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,340
But you want to find someone to help you actually carry it out

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,840
You would go and create a new issue

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,680
You would use the template for a topic seeking a producer

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,720
And then you just fill it out with all the details of your idea

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,220
And the more details the better

98
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,280
Let's say I was going to partner with some mathematician to produce something

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,400
I would be interested in seeing a pretty good outline of the idea

100
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,460
Why it's important, maybe even a storyboard in there

101
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,300
And then on the flip side if you want to produce some kind of content

102
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,960
You know you're an artist or an animator or a video creator

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,960
But you're more interested in getting content ideas from the experts than from yourself

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,080
You would also create an issue

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,540
Use the producer seeking topic template

106
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,060
And then fill that out

107
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,060
So then if you're looking for a collaborator

108
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,800
So let's say I'm going there, I'm looking for mathematicians with interesting ideas

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,700
Or artists and animators that I might want to work with

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,640
You can take a look at all of the open issues

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,860
And the reason for using GitHub for this

112
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,520
Even though that might feel a little bit weird

113
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,540
Is that the tools seem right for what we want

114
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,540
In terms of having a dedicated conversation for each thread

115
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,960
Having nice math embedding in each one of them

116
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,820
Making it easy to link between them

117
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,220
And once you've found your collaborator and you're no longer looking for one

118
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,640
You can close the issue

119
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,900
If that's a totally wild way to do it, feel free to complain at me

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,040
But for my part at least, over the next week or two

121
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,580
I'll be in there, I'll take a look through what the requests for collaboration are

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,120
I think it would be fun for me at least to find some domain expert

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,560
With an interesting topic that I wouldn't have known to produce

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,500
And then I was thinking of also finding someone who's interested in content creation

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,920
Seems like they have at least a little bit of a portfolio

126
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,860
Such that I can tell if the style would mesh well with whatever topic from the domain expert I end up finding

127
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,700
And then I would be there as a kind of producer and extra collaborator

128
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,760
And we could post the final product on 3Blue1Brown

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,780
And so that's the added twist

130
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,180
But other than that, same deal as last year

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,640
Again this time we'll choose at least five different winners

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,500
And again Brilliant has generously offered to contribute $5,000 for prizes to the winners

133
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,440
So we'll give $1,000 to each one

134
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,680
Also this year, slightly different twist

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Each winner will be sent a golden pie creature

136
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,820
Of which only five exist in the whole world

137
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,920
So if that's not enough to get you to contribute, I don't know what will

138
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Other than that, again, all of the official details are in the email list

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,860
Take a look at that first post to get all the details that I probably forgot to mention in this video

140
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,800
And honestly, I'm really excited to see what people make

141
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,960
Thanks for watching!
