1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,324
I've got that wanderlust, I'm gonna walk the scene We will get back to this buddy at the 

2
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:18,544
end of the video But before that I want to tell you about the Summer of Math Exposition 

3
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:27,973
number 2 So last year we did the Summer of Math Exposition number 1 Which was essentially 

4
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:36,774
an open invitation for people to make explanatory math content That they might have 

5
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:45,994
thought about making before But just get an excuse for us to all do it at the same time 

6
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:54,375
and together The way we did it is we framed it as a contest So we had different 

7
00:00:54,375 --> 00:01:03,386
participants, a lot of them were videos, not all of them were videos We had a process 

8
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:12,501
for selecting winners And aside from the competition aspect of it Which is really just 

9
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:21,825
an excuse to have a deadline and have that little extra push to try to make something as 

10
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:31,045
good as you can The most exciting part was just how many really solid pieces of content 

11
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:40,370
came out of that In fact I was curious the other day and I went to look at the analytics 

12
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:49,590
and just looking at the video content Mainly because that's where it's easiest to count 

13
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:58,600
the total number of hits on it Of all of the video submissions to the first Summer of 

14
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:07,820
Math Exposition If we count up all the views that they accumulated It's over 15 million 

15
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:17,144
total views there So we want to do it again If you have some kind of math explainer that 

16
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:26,259
you've been thinking about making and posting online in some capacity Whatever that is 

17
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:35,374
And if you want to use the Summer as an excuse to make it happen There are really just 

18
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:44,699
three main bits of logistics Number 1, subscribe to the official mailing list that we're 

19
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:53,395
going to use for it All of the official communication about things like timelines, 

20
00:02:53,395 --> 00:03:02,510
rules for submissions, answers to any questions that people might have had All of it's 

21
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:11,520
going to live there Secondly, the submission deadline is August 15th So try to finish 

22
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:20,950
whatever you're making maybe 5 days before that Because we have to be immovable with some 

23
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:30,379
kind of line And August 15th is going to be that line And then if you want to engage with 

24
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:39,389
other people who are also participating in the event Maybe share some of your work or 

25
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:48,504
get some feedback or just chat about math in general There's a Discord for it And last 

26
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:55,733
year the Discord was really the lifeblood of the whole event I mean, 

27
00:03:55,733 --> 00:04:05,163
we had the announcement, we had the choosing of the winners But all of the real community 

28
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:14,487
components of it happened on that Discord in between But with this year I also wanted to 

29
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:23,707
add one tiny little twist to the whole event So I've always thought it might be nice to 

30
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:32,927
somehow play matchmaker between domain experts People like mathematicians or professors 

31
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:41,833
of other kinds Or teachers or professionals The people who have the know-how and the 

32
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:50,948
experience with respect to some technical topic They know the best stories to tell But 

33
00:04:50,948 --> 00:05:00,063
maybe they don't have the time to actually put together a video Or they don't have the 

34
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:09,387
video-making skills and content creation skills And then pair them together with content 

35
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:17,350
producers Whether that's people who are really interested in making videos, 

36
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:26,360
video editing, animation Or maybe web developers interested in interactive blog posts 

37
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:35,580
Game developers, artists, whatever the form of content creation might be Because if you 

38
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:44,800
limit your scope to the world of online educational content creation by individuals You 

39
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,915
have to live in this little intersection here Between the people who have good lessons 

40
00:05:53,915 --> 00:06:03,030
to teach And then the people who have the time and the interest And then the technical 

41
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:12,250
know-how to put together that content But with well-organized collaboration You can get 

42
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:20,422
a lot of good content out of the union of those two sets Rather than just the 

43
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:29,432
intersection And I think a shining example of this would be the entire channel number 

44
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:38,547
file Where you've got Brady, who's a very talented journalist and interviewer and film 

45
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:47,872
creator, videographer And he goes and interviews the various experts out there And a lot 

46
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:56,882
of the experts wouldn't be making their own videos But by pairing together with Brady 

47
00:06:56,882 --> 00:07:06,102
they get a really polished and well-thought-out product from it all Another interesting 

48
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:13,960
example of a collaboration like this one is Let me see, what was it called?
