1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,841
In the last month or two, there's been a measurable increase in 

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:05,860
the attention to a wide variety of smaller math channels on YouTube.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,790
My friend James and I ran a second iteration of a contest that we did last year, 

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,300
the Summer of Math Exposition, which invites people to put up lessons about math online.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,724
It could be a video, it could be an article, any medium you dream up, 

6
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:22,612
whatever topic you dream up, and we have some prizes available for the ones that we deem, 

7
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:24,600
in some sense, best, whatever that could mean.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,137
The deadline for submissions was a little over a month ago, 

9
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:32,561
and if we just focus on the video entries, they've collectively accumulated over 7 

10
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:34,160
million views since that time.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,276
Considering that the vast majority of these are uploaded to very young channels, 

12
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:40,981
where the video is often just the first or second upload, 

13
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,800
this was really exciting for me to see.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,748
I suspect a big part of the reason for this rising tide is that after the 

15
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:50,243
submission deadline, we ran a peer-review process where an algorithm would 

16
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,619
feed participants two different videos to compare, 

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,695
and they'd be asked to vote which one of these is, quote, better, 

18
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:57,000
according to a few criteria.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,806
That process generated over 10,000 comparisons, which on the one hand, 

20
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:04,397
helps to provide an initial rough rank ordering of all the videos, 

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,507
but more important than that, any judgements or rankings, 

22
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:11,742
it gave an excuse for many hundreds of people to upload around a similar time, 

23
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:15,870
and then collectively view each other's work, helping to jumpstart a cluster 

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,800
of videos with a shared viewer base.

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,142
And that 7 million number doesn't account for other videos on these channels, 

26
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:25,895
for instance the many submissions people made to last year's contest, which, 

27
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:29,600
since this year's deadline, collectively jumped up by about 2 million views.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,151
One group who told me that last year's contest was what inspired them to put up 

29
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:38,293
their first video, mentioned to me that a video they had made in between the two 

30
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:42,640
contests managed to suddenly jump from 1,000 to 600,000 views during the peer-review 

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,680
process for this year's contest, despite not being among those videos reviewed.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,739
This is all to say, there can be a surprising value in the 

33
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:52,780
seemingly simple presence of a shared goal and a shared deadline.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,450
And again, these are just the video entries, where it's easy 

35
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,340
for us to run these analytics to quickly get a sense of the reach.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Many of my favorite entries were the written ones.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,950
The spirit of the contest, as you can no doubt tell, 

38
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,020
is getting more people to put out math lessons, and on that front, mission accomplished.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,475
But I did promise to select five winners, lessons that stood out as especially 

40
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:16,200
valuable for one reason or another, and that brings us to this video here.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,523
To choose winners, James and I both spent a couple weeks giving a pretty thorough 

42
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:24,180
look at over 100 of the top entries, as determined by the peer-review process.

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,333
We also recruited a few guest judges from the community to help look at a subset of 

44
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,140
these and make sure that our own biases and blind spots aren't playing too heavy a role.

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,280
Many many thanks to them and the time they offered.

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,240
I won't tell you the final decision until the end of the video.

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,970
What I thought might be more fun is to lead up to it by talking through the criteria 

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,276
that I had in mind when making this selection, 

49
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:47,563
highlighting as many exemplary submissions as I can along the way, 

50
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:51,684
hopefully giving any of you who are looking to put out your own math lessons online 

51
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:54,040
at some point a few concrete things to focus on.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,000
At a high level, the four criteria I told people I'd look out for were motivation, 

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,940
clarity, novelty, and memorability.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
The first two are probably the most important, and let's start with motivation.

55
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,131
This actually has two meanings I can think of, 

56
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:09,420
one on the macro scale and one on the micro scale.

57
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,040
By macro scale motivation, I mean how well do you hook someone into the lesson as a whole?

58
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,687
This video by Alexander Berdnikov opens by asking why it is that when 

59
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:23,960
you hear a plane approaching the pitch of its sound seems to slowly fall.

60
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,051
He points out how a lot of people assume that this is the Doppler effect, 

61
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:30,433
but that this doesn't actually hold up to scrutiny, 

62
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,100
since for example that pitch actually rises as the plane is going away from you.

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,580
It's a good point, and an interesting question, you have my attention.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,996
One of my favorite articles in the batch by Adi Mittal prompts you to wonder about 

65
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:47,300
an algorithm behind the panorama feature on your phone, and proceeds to explain 1.

66
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,280
why that's not trivial, and 2.

67
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,987
the linear algebra and projective geometry involved in a DIY-style 

68
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:57,080
project to stitch together two overlapping images taken at different angles.

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,417
Application and tangible problems can make for great motivation, 

70
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,340
but that's not the only source of motivation.

71
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,720
Depending on the target audience, a good nerd sniping question can also do the trick.

72
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,560
This video on the channel Going Null opens with a seemingly impossible puzzle.

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,899
10 prisoners are each given a hat, chosen arbitrarily from 10 total hat types available.

74
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,985
It is possible for some of the prisoners to have the same hat type as others, 

75
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,740
and everyone can see all of the other hats, but not their own.

76
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,177
After given a little time to look at everyone else's hat and think about it all, 

77
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:31,920
the prisoners are to simultaneously shout out a guess for their own hat type.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,185
The question is, can you find a method that guarantees 

79
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:37,940
at least one of the prisoners will make a correct guess?

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,913
This video by Eric Rowland motivates the idea of p-adic numbers and the p-adic metric 

81
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:49,317
by showing how if you take 2 to the 10th, and 2 to the 100th, 2 to the 1000th, 

82
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:52,828
so on and so on, and you assign distinct colors to each digit, 

83
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:57,399
lining them all up on the right, you can see that their final digits line up more 

84
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,960
and more with larger powers.

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,151
Then he asks the question of whether it's reasonable to interpret 

86
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:06,076
this as a kind of convergence, despite the fact that these 

87
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:09,100
numbers are clearly diverging to infinity in the usual sense.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,136
A completely different form of motivation can come from showing 

89
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,535
the historical significance of a problem or a field, 

90
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:19,020
in a sense giving the viewer a feeling that they're part of something bigger.

91
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,313
One excellent video on a channel A Well-Rested Dog provides an overview 

92
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:26,986
of the history of calculus and the progression of how some of the world's 

93
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:30,560
smartest minds grappled with the nuances of infinity and infinitesimals.

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,060
It's the right mixture of entertaining and detailed, 

95
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,694
and he goes on to talk about how learning all of this made his own questions 

96
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,100
and confusions in a calculus class feel validated, 

97
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,460
which I think a lot of students can resonate with.

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,190
This example is less about the intro of a video motivating the lesson it teaches, 

99
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,320
and more about the entire video motivating an entire field.

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,476
Another one like that would be this lecture, by the channel Thisery, 

101
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,826
laying out how Cantor's diagonalization argument and the halting 

102
00:05:56,826 --> 00:06:00,744
problem and a number of other paradoxes people might have heard of in math, 

103
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:03,940
computer science, and logic all follow the same basic pattern.

104
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,373
And moreover, if you try to formalize the exact sense in which they follow the same 

105
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:12,503
pattern, that ends up serving as a pretty nice motivation for the subject of category 

106
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:12,840
theory.

107
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,382
And the last flavor of motivation I'll mention is if you can somehow 

108
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:20,620
make the learner feel like they're playing an active role in the lesson.

109
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,598
This is very hard to do with a video, maybe even impossible, 

110
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,980
and it's best suited for in-person lessons.

111
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,736
But one written entry that I thought did this especially well was an inverse Turing test, 

112
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:36,301
where you as the reader are challenged to come up with a sequence of ones and zeros that 

113
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:40,712
appears random, and the article goes on to explain various statistical tests that you 

114
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:44,251
could apply to prove that the sequence was actually human-generated, 

115
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:45,380
and not really random.

116
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,872
The content of the article is centered around the particular sequence that you, 

117
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:52,683
the reader, created, and you're invited to change it along 

118
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,780
the way to try to get it to pass more tests.

119
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,918
It's a nice touch, and I could easily see this 

120
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,920
working really well as a classroom activity.

121
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,254
Whatever approach you take, whatever flavor of motivation is your favorite, 

122
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:07,094
it's hard to overstate just how important it is that you do actually give viewers a 

123
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:07,780
reason to care.

124
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,661
This is true for any piece of content, but I think it's especially 

125
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:14,503
true for educational content and even more so for math, 

126
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:18,260
given the amount of focus and thought that these topics sometimes require.

127
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,169
I think this was articulated best by the author of one of my favorite podcasts, 

128
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,896
An Opinionated History of Mathematics, who has a manifesto on his website 

129
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:31,126
that lays out what he calls the axioms of learning, beginning with the first axiom, 

130
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:35,659
quote, In a perfect world, students pursue learning not because it is prescribed to them, 

131
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,480
but rather out of a genuine desire to figure things out.

132
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,294
It follows that we must not introduce any topic for which we cannot 

133
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,420
first convince the students that they should want to pursue it.

134
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,554
That said, one mistake that I think I've made in past 

135
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,980
videos is to over-philosophize in the video's introduction.

136
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,333
Motivation is critical, but it doesn't have to take long, 

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,443
and often what actually keeps the viewer engaged is to get right to 

138
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:03,240
the point and leave any commentary about broader themes and connections to the end.

139
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,438
If you can, motivate using clear examples, not 

140
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:09,280
sweeping statements or promises of what is to come.

141
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,494
By microscale motivation, what I mean is whether each new idea that's introduced 

142
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,440
in the lesson itself feels to the learner like it has a good reason to be there.

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,371
For instance, this video by Joshua Maros gives a fairly detailed overview of ray tracing, 

144
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:27,700
and what I love about it is that before he introduces any new technical topic, 

145
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,810
like the rendering equation, importance sampling, or the ReSTER algorithm, 

146
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,030
he's already outlined the main idea and intuition for that topic with really 

147
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,400
well-visualized examples.

148
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,075
It makes it so that once the equation comes on the screen, or the algorithm is described, 

149
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:45,560
it doesn't feel like an expression handed down with nothing to hold onto.

150
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,793
Instead, it arrives only once it's articulating something that already 

151
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:53,820
exists at least loosely in the viewer's mind, making it much easier to parse.

152
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,245
This video by Michael DeFranco about extending the factorial offers 

153
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:01,560
another great example of a lesson with good motivation along the way.

154
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,964
You may have heard that there's a function generalizing the 

155
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:07,780
factorial to real and even complex inputs, the gamma function.

156
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,911
The usual definition is written down as a certain integral expression 

157
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:15,511
sort of handed down from on high, and the justification for why this 

158
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,320
generalizes factorials is certain properties that you can prove about it.

159
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,600
But a lot of students find this unsatisfying.

160
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Where does it come from?

161
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,206
By contrast, in Michael's explanation, he starts by observing the properties 

162
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:31,183
that are true of the normal factorial function that you would want to be true 

163
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:35,058
of a general version, and uses those desired properties to motivate various 

164
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:38,933
different alternate expressions massaged here and there to be more amenable 

165
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:42,860
to non-whole-number inputs, ultimately leading to a pretty satisfying answer.

166
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,132
Another good template for this microscale motivation when 

167
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:50,322
introducing a pretty complicated solution to a problem is to 

168
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:54,140
start with a naive but flawed solution, and then progressively refine it.

169
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,000
This article by Max Slater on differential programming does this particularly well.

170
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,121
The basic question is how you get computers to evaluate derivatives, 

171
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:05,180
a ubiquitous task for machine learning.

172
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,489
He starts by describing the most obvious approach, 

173
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:12,520
and then what flaws it has, and uses that as motivation for another approach.

174
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,972
But that one has its own flaws, and fixing those motivates yet another approach, 

175
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:17,460
and so on.

176
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,387
The ideas he builds up to, dual numbers and backward-mode automatic differentiation, 

177
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:25,733
both could feel a bit confusing if presented out of the blue, 

178
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:29,457
but in context, having motivated each new idea by pointing out flaws 

179
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:33,020
with the previous ones, it all ends up feeling utterly reasonable.

180
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,736
Turning back to that same prisoner hat puzzle I referenced earlier, 

181
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,845
one of the other things I liked about it is how the author doesn't just 

182
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:43,300
present the solution, there are plenty of puzzle videos out there which do that.

183
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,529
Instead, he gives a pretty authentic look at the wrong turns and tangents that 

184
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,727
are involved in the problem-solving process, not even eating up too much time to do so, 

185
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:55,020
and justifies each new step with a general problem-solving principle.

186
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,207
All of this microscale motivation could just as 

187
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,400
well be categorized as a subset of clarity.

188
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,773
If motivating a lesson determines how much attention and focus the viewer is 

189
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:08,840
willing to give you, clarity determines how quickly you burn through that focus.

190
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,000
The best hook in the world is wasted if the lesson which follows is confusing.

191
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,750
This presentation by Xplanaria talks about how to describe various crystal structures 

192
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,222
using group theory, which, considering the complex 3D forms involved and the fact 

193
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:27,640
that most people don't know group theory, has the potential to be very confusing.

194
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,295
But they do a really effective job at keeping concrete examples front and center, 

195
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:35,379
guiding the reader to focus on one relevant pattern at a time, 

196
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,591
and distilling down to a simple version of an idea before seeing how that fits into a 

197
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,060
broader, more general setting.

198
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,054
In general, entries that struck me as especially clear would often keep one or two 

199
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:50,031
examples front and center, and they'd often give a feeling of playing with those 

200
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:54,106
examples, maybe running simulations or tweaking them to run up against edge cases, 

201
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:58,378
and all around giving the viewer a chance to build their own intuitions before general 

202
00:11:58,378 --> 00:11:59,360
rules are presented.

203
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,540
The example doesn't even have to be explicit.

204
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,743
In a visually driven lesson, the choice of what to show on screen when 

205
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:10,427
making general points is often a great opportunity to offer the viewer 

206
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:13,904
a concrete example to hold onto, but without wasting too much time 

207
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:17,640
explicitly talking about that example or overemphasizing its importance.

208
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,140
This I think is part of what gives visually driven lessons the opportunity to be clearer.

209
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,320
As a brief side comment by the way loosely related to clarity, 

210
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,012
for any of you who want to use music in the videos, 

211
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:32,117
while music can enrich the storytelling aspect of a lesson, 

212
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:36,154
setting the desired tone and momentum, once you're getting into the meat of a 

213
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:40,140
technical explanation it's very easy for the music to do more harm than good.

214
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,974
If it's there at all you'll want it to be decidedly 

215
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:45,420
in the background and not calling attention to itself.

216
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,798
I recognize some hypocrisy here, it's definitely something I know I've messed up with 

217
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:53,344
past videos, and it's just worth thinking about whatever benefit you see from the 

218
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:57,020
music you don't want to incur a needless cost on clarity that outweighs that benefit.

219
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,120
Moving on to novelty, this is another category that has two distinct interpretations.

220
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,120
One would be stylistic originality.

221
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,241
Back when I created this channel, part of the reason I wrote my own 

222
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:12,960
animation tool behind it was to ensure a kind of stylistic originality.

223
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,916
Well, the main reason was it was a fun side project, 

224
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,373
and having my hands deep into the guts of some tool helped me to feel 

225
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:22,484
less constrained in trying to visualize whatever came to mind, 

226
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:26,780
but being a forcing function for originality was at least a small part of my reasoning.

227
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,729
This means there's at least a little hint of irony in the fact 

228
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:35,072
that if we fast forward to today, so many of the entries in this contest use that tool, 

229
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:36,800
Manum, to illustrate their lessons.

230
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,704
I have nothing wrong with that, it actually delights me, 

231
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:42,343
it's why I made it open source, and I'm very grateful to the Manum 

232
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:45,140
community for everything they've done to make the tool more accessible.

233
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,745
But I would still encourage people to find their own unique voice and aesthetic, 

234
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,800
whatever tools they use, and whoever they take inspiration from.

235
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,958
I don't want to overemphasize that point because it's the much less important 

236
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,456
half of novelty, the much more important kind of novelty is when the thing 

237
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:03,861
you present would have been very hard to find elsewhere on the internet, 

238
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:07,780
either because it's a highly unique topic or because it's a very unique perspective.

239
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,019
For example, this video on percolation showed a completely fascinating toy model for 

240
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,645
studying phase changes, a model where it's easier to make exact proofs, 

241
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,773
and considering the level of depth and the level of clarity the authors provided, 

242
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:24,902
I think it's fair to say you wouldn't find something like this on YouTube if this 

243
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:25,960
group hadn't made it.

244
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,960
As to memorability, I'll keep this one quick.

245
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,915
Lessons tick off this box when they ask a question that's just so fun to think about, 

246
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,194
or provide such a satisfying aha moment that it stays with you 

247
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,120
long after watching it or reading it.

248
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,640
Admittedly, this one is highly personal and subjective.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,745
To my taste, for example, this video by Daria Ivanova discusses the question of when it's 

250
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:50,383
possible for a single track to have been left by a bicycle, that is, 

251
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:54,021
the back wheel goes through the same path that the front wheel does, 

252
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,920
which is just so fun to think about.

253
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,406
This video by Gurgly Bensik about how involute gears work had 

254
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:03,820
a really satisfying way of explaining why a certain gear design 

255
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,860
pattern worked so well that, for me at least, just stuck.

256
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,820
So with all of that, who are the chosen winners?

257
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,578
In the announcement I promised that one winner slot would go to an entry 

258
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:17,120
that was made as a collaboration, and that one goes to the percolation video.

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
The other four winners are, perhaps unsurprisingly, also ones that I've already mentioned.

260
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,642
They include the post about describing crystal structures with group theory, 

261
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:29,597
the video covering the history of calculus, the one about ray tracing and the algorithms 

262
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:33,420
to make it faster, and the problem solving lesson centered around a tricky hat riddle.

263
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,786
These entries really do speak for themselves, so rather than 

264
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:39,520
telling you too much more here, I encourage you to check them out.

265
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,405
To be honest, after I got it down to about 25 entries that I wanted to at 

266
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:46,816
least be honorable mentions, it was exceedingly hard to actually choose 

267
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:50,416
winners from that, since for each of these I could easily envision a target 

268
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,780
audience for whom that entry would actually be the best recommendation.

269
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,200
It was a game of comparing apples to oranges, but times 25.

270
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,149
Below the video I've left links to the other 20 that I chose as honorable mentions, 

271
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,078
and to a playlist that contains all the video submissions, 

272
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:08,900
and also to a blog post containing links to all of the non-video submissions.

273
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,814
Thanks to a sponsorship from Brilliant, each winner will get $1000 as a cash prize, 

274
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:17,600
and also, and much more importantly I think, a rare edition golden pie creature.

275
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,399
Also after the initial announcement, Risk Zero and Google Fonts 

276
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,000
both generously reached out offering additional prize sponsorships.

277
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,929
I'd also like to thank Protocol Labs for another contribution 

278
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,280
to help us cover the costs of managing the whole event.

279
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,738
Thanks to everybody who participated, and to everybody who helped in creating this 

280
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:38,720
rising tide for new math channels and new math blogs that we've seen in the last month.

281
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,080
It was genuinely inspiring to see just how well this all went.
