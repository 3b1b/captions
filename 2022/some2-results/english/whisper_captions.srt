1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
In the last month or two, there's been a measurable increase in the attention to a

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,860
wide variety of smaller math channels on YouTube.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,980
My friend James and I ran a second iteration of a contest that we did last year, the Summer

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,300
of Math Exposition, which invites people to put up lessons about math online.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,100
It could be a video, it could be an article, any medium you dream up, whatever topic you

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,040
dream up, and we have some prizes available for the ones that we deem, in some sense,

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,600
best, whatever that could mean.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,940
The deadline for submissions was a little over a month ago, and if we just focus on

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,700
the video entries, they've collectively accumulated over 7 million views since that

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,160
time.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,460
Considering that the vast majority of these are uploaded to very young channels, where

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,500
the video is often just the first or second upload, this was really exciting for me to

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,800
see.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,600
I suspect a big part of the reason for this rising tide is that after the submission deadline,

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,080
we ran a peer-review process where an algorithm would feed participants two different videos

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,120
to compare, and they'd be asked to vote which one of these is, quote, better, according

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,000
to a few criteria.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,280
That process generated over 10,000 comparisons, which on the one hand, helps to provide an

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
initial rough rank ordering of all the videos, but more important than that, any judgements

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,460
or rankings, it gave an excuse for many hundreds of people to upload around a similar time,

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,600
and then collectively view each other's work, helping to jumpstart a cluster of videos

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
with a shared viewer base.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,600
And that 7 million number doesn't account for other videos on these channels, for instance

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,600
the many submissions people made to last year's contest, which, since this year's

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
deadline, collectively jumped up by about 2 million views.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,680
One group who told me that last year's contest was what inspired them to put up their first

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,500
video, mentioned to me that a video they had made in between the two contests managed to

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,980
suddenly jump from 1,000 to 600,000 views during the peer-review process for this year's

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,680
contest, despite not being among those videos reviewed.

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,160
This is all to say, there can be a surprising value in the seemingly simple presence of

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,780
a shared goal and a shared deadline.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,940
And again, these are just the video entries, where it's easy for us to run these analytics

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,340
to quickly get a sense of the reach.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Many of my favorite entries were the written ones.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,680
The spirit of the contest, as you can no doubt tell, is getting more people to put out math

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,020
lessons, and on that front, mission accomplished.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,800
But I did promise to select five winners, lessons that stood out as especially valuable

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,200
for one reason or another, and that brings us to this video here.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,240
To choose winners, James and I both spent a couple weeks giving a pretty thorough look

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,180
at over 100 of the top entries, as determined by the peer-review process.

41
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,500
We also recruited a few guest judges from the community to help look at a subset of

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,140
these and make sure that our own biases and blind spots aren't playing too heavy a role.

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,280
Many many thanks to them and the time they offered.

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,240
I won't tell you the final decision until the end of the video.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,560
What I thought might be more fun is to lead up to it by talking through the criteria that

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,900
I had in mind when making this selection, highlighting as many exemplary submissions

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,280
as I can along the way, hopefully giving any of you who are looking to put out your

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,040
own math lessons online at some point a few concrete things to focus on.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,020
At a high level, the four criteria I told people I'd look out for were motivation,

50
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,940
clarity, novelty, and memorability.

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
The first two are probably the most important, and let's start with motivation.

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,860
This actually has two meanings I can think of, one on the macro scale and one on the

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,420
micro scale.

54
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,040
By macro scale motivation, I mean how well do you hook someone into the lesson as a whole?

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,240
This video by Alexander Berdnikov opens by asking why it is that when you hear a plane

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,960
approaching the pitch of its sound seems to slowly fall.

57
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,720
He points out how a lot of people assume that this is the Doppler effect, but that this

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,980
doesn't actually hold up to scrutiny, since for example that pitch actually rises as the

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,100
plane is going away from you.

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,580
It's a good point, and an interesting question, you have my attention.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,560
One of my favorite articles in the batch by Adi Mittal prompts you to wonder about an

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,300
algorithm behind the panorama feature on your phone, and proceeds to explain 1.

63
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,280
why that's not trivial, and 2.

64
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,820
the linear algebra and projective geometry involved in a DIY-style project to stitch

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,080
together two overlapping images taken at different angles.

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,200
Application and tangible problems can make for great motivation, but that's not the

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,340
only source of motivation.

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,720
Depending on the target audience, a good nerd sniping question can also do the trick.

69
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,560
This video on the channel Going Null opens with a seemingly impossible puzzle.

70
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,900
10 prisoners are each given a hat, chosen arbitrarily from 10 total hat types available.

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,480
It is possible for some of the prisoners to have the same hat type as others, and everyone

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,740
can see all of the other hats, but not their own.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,500
After given a little time to look at everyone else's hat and think about it all, the prisoners

74
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,920
are to simultaneously shout out a guess for their own hat type.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,860
The question is, can you find a method that guarantees at least one of the prisoners will

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,940
make a correct guess?

77
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,640
This video by Eric Rowland motivates the idea of p-adic numbers and the p-adic metric by

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,200
showing how if you take 2 to the 10th, and 2 to the 100th, 2 to the 1000th, so on and

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,380
so on, and you assign distinct colors to each digit, lining them all up on the right, you

80
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,960
can see that their final digits line up more and more with larger powers.

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,980
Then he asks the question of whether it's reasonable to interpret this as a kind of

82
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,880
convergence, despite the fact that these numbers are clearly diverging to infinity

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,100
in the usual sense.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,680
A completely different form of motivation can come from showing the historical significance

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,340
of a problem or a field, in a sense giving the viewer a feeling that they're part of

86
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,020
something bigger.

87
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,440
One excellent video on a channel A Well-Rested Dog provides an overview of the history of

88
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,240
calculus and the progression of how some of the world's smartest minds grappled with

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
the nuances of infinity and infinitesimals.

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,620
It's the right mixture of entertaining and detailed, and he goes on to talk about how

91
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,160
learning all of this made his own questions and confusions in a calculus class feel validated,

92
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,460
which I think a lot of students can resonate with.

93
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,200
This example is less about the intro of a video motivating the lesson it teaches, and

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,320
more about the entire video motivating an entire field.

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Another one like that would be this lecture, by the channel Thisery, laying out how Cantor's

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,340
diagonalization argument and the halting problem and a number of other paradoxes people might

97
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,940
have heard of in math, computer science, and logic all follow the same basic pattern.

98
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,440
And moreover, if you try to formalize the exact sense in which they follow the same

99
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,380
pattern, that ends up serving as a pretty nice motivation for the subject of category

100
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,840
theory.

101
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,600
And the last flavor of motivation I'll mention is if you can somehow make the learner feel

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,620
like they're playing an active role in the lesson.

103
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,000
This is very hard to do with a video, maybe even impossible, and it's best suited for

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,980
in-person lessons.

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
But one written entry that I thought did this especially well was an inverse Turing test,

106
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,640
where you as the reader are challenged to come up with a sequence of ones and zeros

107
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,620
that appears random, and the article goes on to explain various statistical tests that

108
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,960
you could apply to prove that the sequence was actually human-generated, and not really

109
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,380
random.

110
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,480
The content of the article is centered around the particular sequence that you, the reader,

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,780
created, and you're invited to change it along the way to try to get it to pass more tests.

112
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,920
It's a nice touch, and I could easily see this working really well as a classroom activity.

113
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,420
Whatever approach you take, whatever flavor of motivation is your favorite, it's hard

114
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,780
to overstate just how important it is that you do actually give viewers a reason to care.

115
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,480
This is true for any piece of content, but I think it's especially true for educational

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,400
content and even more so for math, given the amount of focus and thought that these topics

117
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,260
sometimes require.

118
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,300
I think this was articulated best by the author of one of my favorite podcasts, An Opinionated

119
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,680
History of Mathematics, who has a manifesto on his website that lays out what he calls

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,820
the axioms of learning, beginning with the first axiom,

121
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,640
quote, In a perfect world, students pursue learning not because it is prescribed to them,

122
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,480
but rather out of a genuine desire to figure things out.

123
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,360
It follows that we must not introduce any topic for which we cannot first convince the

124
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,420
students that they should want to pursue it.

125
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,660
That said, one mistake that I think I've made in past videos is to over-philosophize

126
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,980
in the video's introduction.

127
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,800
Motivation is critical, but it doesn't have to take long, and often what actually keeps

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,620
the viewer engaged is to get right to the point and leave any commentary about broader

129
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,240
themes and connections to the end.

130
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,620
If you can, motivate using clear examples, not sweeping statements or promises of what

131
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,280
is to come.

132
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,000
By microscale motivation, what I mean is whether each new idea that's introduced in the lesson

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,440
itself feels to the learner like it has a good reason to be there.

134
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,260
For instance, this video by Joshua Maros gives a fairly detailed overview of ray tracing,

135
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,160
and what I love about it is that before he introduces any new technical topic, like the

136
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,920
rendering equation, importance sampling, or the ReSTER algorithm, he's already outlined

137
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,400
the main idea and intuition for that topic with really well-visualized examples.

138
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,120
It makes it so that once the equation comes on the screen, or the algorithm is described,

139
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,560
it doesn't feel like an expression handed down with nothing to hold onto.

140
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,800
Instead, it arrives only once it's articulating something that already exists at least loosely

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,820
in the viewer's mind, making it much easier to parse.

142
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,540
This video by Michael DeFranco about extending the factorial offers another great example

143
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,560
of a lesson with good motivation along the way.

144
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,040
You may have heard that there's a function generalizing the factorial to real and even

145
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,780
complex inputs, the gamma function.

146
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,460
The usual definition is written down as a certain integral expression sort of handed

147
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,660
down from on high, and the justification for why this generalizes factorials is certain

148
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,320
properties that you can prove about it.

149
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,600
But a lot of students find this unsatisfying.

150
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Where does it come from?

151
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,620
By contrast, in Michael's explanation, he starts by observing the properties that are

152
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,060
true of the normal factorial function that you would want to be true of a general version,

153
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,420
and uses those desired properties to motivate various different alternate expressions massaged

154
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,400
here and there to be more amenable to non-whole-number inputs, ultimately leading to a pretty satisfying

155
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,860
answer.

156
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,200
Another good template for this microscale motivation when introducing a pretty complicated

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,320
solution to a problem is to start with a naive but flawed solution, and then progressively

158
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,140
refine it.

159
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,000
This article by Max Slater on differential programming does this particularly well.

160
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,320
The basic question is how you get computers to evaluate derivatives, a ubiquitous task

161
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,180
for machine learning.

162
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,680
He starts by describing the most obvious approach, and then what flaws it has, and uses that

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
as motivation for another approach.

164
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,800
But that one has its own flaws, and fixing those motivates yet another approach, and

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,460
so on.

166
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,060
The ideas he builds up to, dual numbers and backward-mode automatic differentiation, both

167
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,160
could feel a bit confusing if presented out of the blue, but in context, having motivated

168
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,500
each new idea by pointing out flaws with the previous ones, it all ends up feeling utterly

169
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,020
reasonable.

170
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,660
Turning back to that same prisoner hat puzzle I referenced earlier, one of the other things

171
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,360
I liked about it is how the author doesn't just present the solution, there are plenty

172
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,300
of puzzle videos out there which do that.

173
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,720
Instead, he gives a pretty authentic look at the wrong turns and tangents that are involved

174
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,620
in the problem-solving process, not even eating up too much time to do so, and justifies each

175
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,020
new step with a general problem-solving principle.

176
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,400
All of this microscale motivation could just as well be categorized as a subset of clarity.

177
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,900
If motivating a lesson determines how much attention and focus the viewer is willing

178
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,840
to give you, clarity determines how quickly you burn through that focus.

179
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,000
The best hook in the world is wasted if the lesson which follows is confusing.

180
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,700
This presentation by Xplanaria talks about how to describe various crystal structures

181
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,220
using group theory, which, considering the complex 3D forms involved and the fact that

182
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,640
most people don't know group theory, has the potential to be very confusing.

183
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,800
But they do a really effective job at keeping concrete examples front and center, guiding

184
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,080
the reader to focus on one relevant pattern at a time, and distilling down to a simple

185
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,060
version of an idea before seeing how that fits into a broader, more general setting.

186
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,700
In general, entries that struck me as especially clear would often keep one or two examples

187
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,920
front and center, and they'd often give a feeling of playing with those examples, maybe

188
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,220
running simulations or tweaking them to run up against edge cases, and all around giving

189
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,360
the viewer a chance to build their own intuitions before general rules are presented.

190
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,540
The example doesn't even have to be explicit.

191
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,540
In a visually driven lesson, the choice of what to show on screen when making general

192
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,320
points is often a great opportunity to offer the viewer a concrete example to hold onto,

193
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,920
but without wasting too much time explicitly talking about that example or overemphasizing

194
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,640
its importance.

195
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,140
This I think is part of what gives visually driven lessons the opportunity to be clearer.

196
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,800
As a brief side comment by the way loosely related to clarity, for any of you who want

197
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,980
to use music in the videos, while music can enrich the storytelling aspect of a lesson,

198
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,480
setting the desired tone and momentum, once you're getting into the meat of a technical

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,140
explanation it's very easy for the music to do more harm than good.

200
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,420
If it's there at all you'll want it to be decidedly in the background and not calling

201
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,420
attention to itself.

202
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,580
I recognize some hypocrisy here, it's definitely something I know I've messed up with past

203
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,540
videos, and it's just worth thinking about whatever benefit you see from the music you

204
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,020
don't want to incur a needless cost on clarity that outweighs that benefit.

205
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,120
Moving on to novelty, this is another category that has two distinct interpretations.

206
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,120
One would be stylistic originality.

207
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,700
Back when I created this channel, part of the reason I wrote my own animation tool behind

208
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,960
it was to ensure a kind of stylistic originality.

209
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,640
Well, the main reason was it was a fun side project, and having my hands deep into the

210
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,280
guts of some tool helped me to feel less constrained in trying to visualize whatever came to mind,

211
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,780
but being a forcing function for originality was at least a small part of my reasoning.

212
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,240
This means there's at least a little hint of irony in the fact that if we fast forward

213
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,420
to today, so many of the entries in this contest use that tool, Manum, to illustrate their

214
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:36,800
lessons.

215
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,820
I have nothing wrong with that, it actually delights me, it's why I made it open source,

216
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,240
and I'm very grateful to the Manum community for everything they've done to make the

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,140
tool more accessible.

218
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,880
But I would still encourage people to find their own unique voice and aesthetic, whatever

219
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,800
tools they use, and whoever they take inspiration from.

220
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,580
I don't want to overemphasize that point because it's the much less important half

221
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,320
of novelty, the much more important kind of novelty is when the thing you present would

222
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,320
have been very hard to find elsewhere on the internet, either because it's a highly unique

223
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,780
topic or because it's a very unique perspective.

224
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,180
For example, this video on percolation showed a completely fascinating toy model for studying

225
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,820
phase changes, a model where it's easier to make exact proofs, and considering the

226
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,820
level of depth and the level of clarity the authors provided, I think it's fair to say

227
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,960
you wouldn't find something like this on YouTube if this group hadn't made it.

228
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,960
As to memorability, I'll keep this one quick.

229
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,620
Lessons tick off this box when they ask a question that's just so fun to think about,

230
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,320
or provide such a satisfying aha moment that it stays with you long after watching it or

231
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,120
reading it.

232
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,640
Admittedly, this one is highly personal and subjective.

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,120
To my taste, for example, this video by Daria Ivanova discusses the question of when it's

234
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,420
possible for a single track to have been left by a bicycle, that is, the back wheel

235
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,220
goes through the same path that the front wheel does, which is just so fun to think

236
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,920
about.

237
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,960
This video by Gurgly Bensik about how involute gears work had a really satisfying way of

238
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,380
explaining why a certain gear design pattern worked so well that, for me at least, just

239
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,860
stuck.

240
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,820
So with all of that, who are the chosen winners?

241
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,960
In the announcement I promised that one winner slot would go to an entry that was made as

242
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,120
a collaboration, and that one goes to the percolation video.

243
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
The other four winners are, perhaps unsurprisingly, also ones that I've already mentioned.

244
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,380
They include the post about describing crystal structures with group theory, the video covering

245
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,240
the history of calculus, the one about ray tracing and the algorithms to make it faster,

246
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,420
and the problem solving lesson centered around a tricky hat riddle.

247
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,080
These entries really do speak for themselves, so rather than telling you too much more here,

248
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,520
I encourage you to check them out.

249
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,540
To be honest, after I got it down to about 25 entries that I wanted to at least be honorable

250
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,860
mentions, it was exceedingly hard to actually choose winners from that, since for each of

251
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,880
these I could easily envision a target audience for whom that entry would actually be the

252
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,780
best recommendation.

253
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,200
It was a game of comparing apples to oranges, but times 25.

254
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,160
Below the video I've left links to the other 20 that I chose as honorable mentions, and

255
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,000
to a playlist that contains all the video submissions, and also to a blog post containing

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,900
links to all of the non-video submissions.

257
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,100
Thanks to a sponsorship from Brilliant, each winner will get $1000 as a cash prize, and

258
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,600
also, and much more importantly I think, a rare edition golden pie creature.

259
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,720
Also after the initial announcement, Risk Zero and Google Fonts both generously reached

260
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,000
out offering additional prize sponsorships.

261
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,800
I'd also like to thank Protocol Labs for another contribution to help us cover the

262
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,280
costs of managing the whole event.

263
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,200
Thanks to everybody who participated, and to everybody who helped in creating this rising

264
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,720
tide for new math channels and new math blogs that we've seen in the last month.

265
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,420
It was genuinely inspiring to see just how well this all went.
