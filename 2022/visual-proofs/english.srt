00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Today I'd like to share with you three fake proofs in increasing order of subtlety,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,120
and then discuss what each one of them has to tell us about math.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,120
The first proof is for a formula for the surface area of a sphere,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,440
and the way that it starts is to subdivide that sphere into vertical slices,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,560
the way you might chop up an orange or paint a beach ball.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
We then unravel all of those wedge slices from the northern hemisphere,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
so that they poke up like this,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
and then symmetrically unravel all of those from the southern hemisphere below,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,560
and now interlace those pieces to get a shape whose area we want to figure out.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,160
The base of this shape came from the circumference of the sphere,

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,280
it's an unraveled equator, so its length is 2 pi times the radius of the sphere,

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,080
and then the other side of this shape came from the height of one of these wedges,

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,280
which is a quarter of a walk around the sphere, and so it has a length of pi halves times r.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
The idea is that this is only an approximation, the edges might not be perfectly straight,

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
but if we think of the limit as we do finer and finer slices of the sphere,

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,360
this shape whose area we want to know gets closer to being a perfect rectangle,

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,000
one whose area will be pi halves r times 2 pi r, or in other words pi squared times r squared.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,840
The proof is elegant, it translates a hard problem into a situation that's easier to understand,

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
it has that element of surprise while still being intuitive,

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
its only fault, really, is that it's completely wrong,

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
the true surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r squared.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
I originally saw this example thanks to Henry Reich, and to be fair,

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,440
it's not necessarily inconsistent with the 4 pi r squared formula, just so long as pi is equal to 4.

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,560
For the next proof, I'd like to show you a simple argument for the fact that pi is equal to 4.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,800
We start off with a circle, say with radius 1, and we ask how can we figure out its circumference,

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,760
after all, pi is by definition the ratio of this circumference to the diameter of the circle.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,680
We start off by drawing the square whose side lengths are all tangent to that circle.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,280
It's not too hard to see that the perimeter of this square is 8.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
Then, and some of you may have seen this before, it's a kind of classic argument,

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,320
the argument proceeds by producing a sequence of curves,

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,760
all of whom also have this perimeter of 8, but which more and more closely approximate the circle.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,440
But the full nuance of this example is not always emphasized.

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,680
First of all, just to make things crystal clear, the way each of these iterations works is to fold

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,240
in each of the corners of the previous shape so that they just barely kiss the circle,

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,000
and you can take a moment to convince yourself that in each region where a fold happened,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,960
the perimeter doesn't change. For example, in the upper right here,

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,320
instead of walking up and then left, the new curve goes left and then up.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,720
And something similar is true at all of the folds of all of the different iterations.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
Wherever the previous iteration went direction A then direction B,

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,800
the new iteration goes direction B then direction A, but no length is lost or gained.

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,600
Some of you might say, well, obviously this isn't going to give the true perimeter of the circle,

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,280
because no matter how many iterations you do, when you zoom in, it remains jagged,

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
it's not a smooth curve. You're taking these very inefficient steps along the circle.

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
While that is true, and ultimately the reason things are wrong,

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,520
if you want to appreciate the lesson this example is teaching us,

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,920
the claim of the example is not that any one of these approximations equals the curve,

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
it's that the limit of all of the approximations equals our circle.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
And to appreciate the lesson that this example teaches us, it's worth taking a moment to be

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,000
a little more mathematically precise about what I mean by the limit of a sequence of curves.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Let's say we describe the very first shape, this square, as a parametric function,

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
something that has an input t and it outputs a point in 2d space,

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,280
so that as t ranges from 0 to 1, it traces that square.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,720
I'll call that function c0, and likewise we can parameterize the next iteration with a function

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,120
I'll call c1, as the parameter t ranges from 0 up to 1, the output of this function traces along

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
that curve. This is just so that we can think of these shapes as instead being functions.

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,000
Now I want you to consider a particular value of t, maybe 0.2, and then consider the sequence

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
of points that you get by evaluating the sequence of functions we have at this particular point.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now I want you to consider the limit as n approaches infinity of c sub n of 0.2.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,400
This limit is a well-defined point in 2d space, in fact that point sits on the circle,

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,840
and there's nothing specific about 0.2. We could do this limiting process for any input t,

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,920
and so I can define a new function that I'll call c infinity, which by definition at any input t

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,560
is whatever this limiting value for all the curves is.

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,840
So here's the point. That limiting function, c infinity, is the circle. It's not an approximation

64
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,040
of the circle, it's not some jagged version of the circle, it is the genuine smooth circular curve

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,360
whose perimeter we want to know. And what's also true is that the limit of the lengths of all of

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,720
our curves really is 8, because each individual curve really does have a perimeter of 8.

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,840
And there are all sorts of examples throughout calculus when we talk about approximating one

68
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,160
thing we want to know as a limit of a bunch of other things that are easier to understand.

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,000
So the question at the heart here is why exactly is it not okay to do that in this example?

70
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,560
And maybe at this point you step back and say, you know, it's just not enough for things to look

71
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,840
the same. This is why we need rigor, it's why we need proofs, it's why since the days of Euclid

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,760
mathematicians have followed in his footsteps and deduced truths step by step from axioms forward.

73
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,080
But for this last example I would like to do something that doesn't lean as hard on visual

74
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,640
intuition and instead give a Euclid style proof for the claim that all triangles are isosceles.

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,960
The way this will work is we'll take any particular triangle and make no assumptions about it,

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll label its vertices a, b, and c, and what I would like to prove for you is that the side length

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,080
a, b is necessarily equal to the side length a, c. Now to be clear the result is obviously false,

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,240
just in the diagram I've drawn you can visually see that these lengths are not equal to each

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
other. But I challenge you to see if you can identify what's wrong about the proof I'm about

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,080
to show you. Honestly it's very subtle and three gold stars for anyone who can identify it.

81
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,880
The first thing I'll do is draw the perpendicular bisector, the line bc, so that means this angle

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,680
here is 90 degrees and this length is by definition the same as this length, and we'll

83
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,400
label that intersection point d. And then next I will draw the angle bisector at a, which means by

84
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,200
definition this little angle here is the same as this little angle here, I'll label both of them

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,120
alpha, and we'll say that the point where these two intersect is p. And now like a lot of Euclid

86
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,960
style proofs we're just going to draw some new lines, figure out what things must be equal,

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,880
and get some conclusions. For instance let's draw the line from p which is perpendicular to the side

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,600
length ac, and we'll label that intersection point e. And likewise we'll draw the line from p

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,120
down to the other side length ac, again it's perpendicular, and we'll label that intersection

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,960
point f. My first claim is that this triangle here, which is afp, is the same or at least congruent to

91
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,520
this triangle over here, aep. Essentially this follows from symmetry across that angle bisector.

92
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,160
More specifically we can say they share a side length, and then they both have an angle alpha,

93
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,040
and both have an angle 90 degrees. So it follows by the side angle angle congruence relation.

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,200
Maybe my drawing is a little bit sloppy, but the logic helps us see that they do have to be the

95
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,640
same. Next I'll draw a line from p down to b, and then from p down to c, and I claim that this

96
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,040
triangle here is congruent to its reflection across that perpendicular bisector. Again the

97
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,600
symmetry maybe helps make this clear, but more rigorously they both have the same base, they both

98
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,560
have a 90 degree angle, and they both have the same height. So it follows by the side angle side

99
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,120
relation. So based on that first pair of triangles I'm going to mark this side length here as being

100
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,080
the same as this side length here, marking them with double tick marks. And based on the second

101
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,920
triangle relation I'll mark this side length here as the same as this line over here, marking them

102
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,400
with triple tick marks. And so from that we have two more triangles that need to be the same,

103
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,680
namely this one over here and the one with corresponding two side lengths over here.

104
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,160
And the reasoning here is they both have that triple ticked side, a double ticked side, and

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,360
they're both 90 degree triangles. So this follows by the side side angle congruence relation.

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And all of those are valid congruence relations, I'm not pulling the wool over your eyes with one

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,440
of those. And all of this will basically be enough to show us why a b has to be the same as b c.

108
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,200
That first pair of triangles implies that the length a f is the same as the length a e,

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
those are corresponding sides to each other, I'll just color them in red here.

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,200
And then that last triangle relation guarantees for us that the side f b is going to be the same

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,520
as the side e c. I'll kind of color both of those in blue. And finally, the result we want basically

112
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,000
comes from adding up these two equations. The length a f plus f b is clearly the same as the

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,880
total length a b. And likewise, the length a e plus e c is the same as the total length a c.

114
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,160
So all in all, the side length a b has to be the same as the side length a c.

115
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,240
And because we made no assumptions about the triangle, this implies that any triangle is

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
isosceles. Actually, for that matter, since we made no assumptions about the specific two sides

117
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,720
we chose, it implies that any triangle is equilateral. So this leaves us somewhat

118
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,520
disturbingly with three different possibilities. All triangles really are equilateral, that's just

119
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,120
the truth of the universe. Or you can use Euclid-style reasoning to derive false results.

120
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,680
Or there's something wrong in the proof. But if there is, where exactly is it?

121
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,440
So what exactly is going on with these three examples? Now the thing that's a little bit

122
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,640
troubling about that first example with the sphere is that it is very similar in spirit to a lot of

123
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,840
other famous and supposedly true visual proofs from geometry. For example, there's a very famous

124
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,280
proof about the area of a circle that starts off by dividing it into a bunch of little pizza wedges.

125
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,600
And you take all those wedges and you straighten them out, essentially lining up the crust of that

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,880
pizza. And then we take half of the wedges and interslice them with the other half. And the idea

127
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,840
is that this might not be a perfect rectangle, it's got some bumps and curves. But as you take thinner

128
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,720
and thinner slices, you get something that's closer and closer to a true rectangle. And the

129
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,760
width of that rectangle comes from half the circumference of the circle, which is by definition

130
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,920
pi times r. And then the height of that rectangle comes from the radius of the circle, r, meaning

131
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,480
that the whole area is pi r squared. This time the result is valid. But why is it not okay to do what

132
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,320
we did with the spheres, but somehow it is okay to do this with the pizza slices? The main problem

133
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,120
with the sphere argument is that when we flatten out all of those orange wedges, if we were to do

134
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,080
it accurately in a way that preserves their area, they don't look like triangles, they should bulge

135
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,960
outward. And if you want to see this, let's think really critically about just one particular one

136
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,000
of those wedges on the sphere and ask yourself, how does the width across that wedge, this little

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,320
portion of a line of latitude, vary as you go up and down the wedge? In particular, if you consider

138
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,480
the angle phi from the z axis down to a point on this wedge as we walk down it, what's the length

139
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,960
of that width as a function of phi? For those of you curious about the details of these sorts of

140
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,400
things, you'd start off by drawing this line up here from the z axis to a point on the wedge.

141
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,680
Its length will be the radius of the sphere r times the sine of this angle. That lets us deduce

142
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,240
how long the total line of latitude is where we're sitting. It'll basically be 2 pi times that radial

143
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,000
line, 2 pi r sine of phi, and then the width of the wedge that we care about is just some constant

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,880
proportion of that full line of latitude. Now the details don't matter too much. The one thing I

145
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,840
want you to notice is that this is not a linear relationship. As you walk from the top of that

146
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,600
wedge down to the bottom, letting phi range from zero up to pi halves, the width of the wedge

147
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,160
doesn't grow linearly, instead it grows according to a sine curve. And so, when we're unwrapping all

148
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,960
of these wedges, if we want those widths to be preserved, they should end up a little bit chubbier

149
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,440
around the base. Their side lengths are not linear. What this means is when we tried to

150
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,280
interlace all of the wedges from the northern hemisphere with those from the southern, there's

151
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,080
a meaningful amount of overlap between those non-linear edges. And we can't wave our hands

152
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,040
about a limiting argument. This is an overlap that persists as you take finer and finer subdivisions.

153
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,240
And ultimately it's that overlap that accounts for the difference between our false answer with a pi

154
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,320
squared from the true answer that has 4 pi. It reminds me of one of those rearrangement puzzles

155
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
where you have a number of pieces and just by moving them around you can seemingly create area

156
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
out of nowhere. For example, right now I've arranged all these pieces to form a triangle

157
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,520
except it's missing two units of area in the middle. Now I want you to focus on the vertices

158
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,000
of that triangle, these white dots. Those don't move, I'm not pulling any trickery with that,

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
but I can rearrange all of the pieces back to how they originally were so that those two units of

160
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,520
area in the middle seem to disappear, while the constituent parts remain the same, the triangle

161
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,400
that they form remains the same, and yet two units of area seem to appear out of nowhere.

162
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,960
If you've never seen this one before by the way, I highly encourage you to pause and try to think

163
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,800
it through. It's a very fun little puzzle. The answer starts to reveal itself if we carefully

164
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,480
draw the edges of this triangle and zoom in close enough to see that our pieces don't actually fit

165
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,000
inside the triangle, they bulge out ever so slightly. Or at least arranged like this they

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,360
bulge out ever so slightly. When we rearrange them and we zoom back in we can see that they dent

167
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,640
inward ever so slightly. And that very subtle difference between the bulge out and the dent

168
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,000
inward accounts for all of the difference in area. The slope of the edge of this blue triangle works

169
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,360
out to be 5 divided by 2, whereas the slope of the edge of this red triangle works out to be 7

170
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
divided by 3. Those numbers are close enough to look similar as slope, but they allow for

171
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,640
this denting inward and the bulging outward. You have to be wary of lines that are made to

172
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,800
look straight when you haven't had explicit confirmation that they actually are straight.

173
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,640
One quick added comment on the sphere, the fundamental issue here is that the geometry

174
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,840
of a curved surface is fundamentally different from the geometry of flat space. The relevant

175
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,880
search term here would be Gaussian curvature. You can't flatten things out from a sphere without

176
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,720
losing geometric information. Now when you do see limiting arguments that relate to little pieces

177
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,920
on a sphere that somehow get flattened out and are reasoned through there, those only can work

178
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,800
if the limiting pieces that you're talking about get smaller in both directions. It's only when you

179
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,480
zoom in close to a curved surface that it appears locally flat. The issue with our orange wedge

180
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,600
argument is that our pieces never got exposed to that local flatness because they only got thin in

181
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,640
one direction. They maintain the curvature in that other direction. Now on the topic of the

182
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,600
subtlety of limiting arguments, let's turn back to our limit of jagged curves that approaches the

183
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,120
smooth circular curve. As I said, the limiting curve really is a circle and the limiting value

184
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,160
for the lengths of your approximations really is 8. Here the basic issue is that there is no reason

185
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,800
to expect that the limit of the lengths of the curves is the same as the length of the limits

186
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,800
of the curves, and in fact this is a nice counter example to show why that's not the case. The real

187
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,360
point of this example is not the fear that anyone is ever going to believe that it shows that pi is

188
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,520
equal to 4. Instead it shows why care is required in other cases where people apply limiting

189
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,280
arguments. For example, this happens all throughout calculus. It is the heart of calculus where say

190
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,720
you want to know the area under a given curve. The way we typically think about it is to approximate

191
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,680
that with a set of rectangles because those are the things we know how to compute the areas of.

192
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,800
You just take the base times height in each case. Now this is a very jagged approximation, but the

193
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,520
thought, or I guess the hope, is that as you take a finer and finer subdivision into thinner and

194
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,160
thinner rectangles, the sums of those areas approaches the thing we actually care about.

195
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,120
If you want to make it rigorous, you have to be explicit about the error between these

196
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,400
approximations and the true thing we care about, the area under this curve. For example, you might

197
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,280
start your argument by saying that that error has to be strictly less than the area of these

198
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,960
red rectangles. Essentially the deviation between the curve and our approximating rectangles sits

199
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,920
strictly inside that red region. And then what you would want to argue is that in this limiting

200
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,800
process, the cumulative area of all of those red rectangles has to approach zero.

201
00:16:50,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Now as to the final example, our proof that all triangles are isosceles, let me show you what it

202
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,560
looks like if I'm a little bit more careful about actually constructing the angle bisector rather

203
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,840
than just eyeballing it. When I do that, the relevant intersection point actually sits outside

204
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,920
of the triangle. And then from there, if I go through everything that we did in the original

205
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,400
argument, drawing the relevant perpendicular lines, all of that, every triangle that I claimed

206
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,200
was congruent really is congruent. All of those were genuinely true. And the corresponding lengths

207
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,840
of those triangles that I claimed were the same really are the same. The one place where the proof

208
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,120
breaks down is at the very end, when I said that the full side length AC was equal to AE plus EC.

209
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,000
That was only true under the hidden assumption that that point E sat in between them. But in

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,440
reality, for many triangles, that point would sit outside of those two. It's pretty subtle, isn't it?

211
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,320
The point in all of this is that while visual intuition is great, and visual proofs often give

212
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,000
you a nice way of elucidating what's going on with otherwise opaque rigor, visual arguments

213
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,440
and snazzy diagrams will never obviate the need for critical thinking. In math, you cannot escape

214
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
the need to look out for hidden assumptions and edge cases.
