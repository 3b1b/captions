00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,059
Today I'd like to share with you three fake proofs in increasing order of subtlety, 

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,200
and then discuss what each one of them has to tell us about math.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,942
The first proof is for a formula for the surface area of a sphere, 

4
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:19,036
and the way that it starts is to subdivide that sphere into vertical slices, 

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:22,120
the way you might chop up an orange or paint a beach ball.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,443
We then unravel all of those wedge slices from the northern hemisphere, 

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,838
so that they poke up like this, and then symmetrically unravel all of those from the 

8
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:35,337
southern hemisphere below, and now interlace those pieces to get a shape whose area we 

9
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:36,320
want to figure out.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,459
The base of this shape came from the circumference of the sphere, 

11
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:45,072
it's an unraveled equator, so its length is 2 pi times the radius of the sphere, 

12
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:49,800
and then the other side of this shape came from the height of one of these wedges, 

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,533
which is a quarter of a walk around the sphere, 

14
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,040
and so it has a length of pi halves times r.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,722
The idea is that this is only an approximation, 

16
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:02,585
the edges might not be perfectly straight, but if we think of the limit as we do finer 

17
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:07,336
and finer slices of the sphere, this shape whose area we want to know gets closer to 

18
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:11,584
being a perfect rectangle, one whose area will be pi halves r times 2 pi r, 

19
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,100
or in other words pi squared times r squared.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,638
The proof is elegant, it translates a hard problem into a situation that's easier to 

21
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:24,494
understand, it has that element of surprise while still being intuitive, its only fault, 

22
00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:29,023
really, is that it's completely wrong, the true surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r 

23
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:29,460
squared.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,032
I originally saw this example thanks to Henry Reich, and to be fair, 

25
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:37,695
it's not necessarily inconsistent with the 4 pi r squared formula, 

26
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:39,500
just so long as pi is equal to 4.

27
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,586
For the next proof I'd like to show you a simple 

28
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:44,640
argument for the fact that pi is equal to 4.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,215
We start off with a circle, say with radius 1, 

30
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:51,345
and we ask how can we figure out its circumference, after all, 

31
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:55,420
pi is by definition the ratio of this circumference to the diameter of the circle.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,760
We start off by drawing the square whose side lengths are all tangent to that circle.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,360
It's not too hard to see that the perimeter of this square is 8.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,029
Then, and some of you may have seen this before, it's a kind of classic argument, 

35
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:10,747
the argument proceeds by producing a sequence of curves, 

36
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:14,323
all of whom also have this perimeter of 8, but which more and more closely 

37
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,420
approximate the circle.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,060
But the full nuance of this example is not always emphasized.

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,350
First of all, just to make things crystal clear, 

40
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,904
the way each of these iterations works is to fold in each of the corners of 

41
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:27,756
the previous shape so that they just barely kiss the circle, 

42
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:31,964
and you can take a moment to convince yourself that in each region where a fold happened, 

43
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:33,320
the perimeter doesn't change.

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,890
For example, in the upper right here, instead of walking up and then left, 

45
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,460
the new curve goes left and then up.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,560
And something similar is true at all of the folds of all of the different iterations.

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,459
Wherever the previous iteration went direction A then direction B, 

48
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,900
the new iteration goes direction B then direction A, but no length is lost or gained.

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,462
Some of you might say, well obviously this isn't going to give the true perimeter of the 

50
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:58,619
circle, because no matter how many iterations you do, when you zoom in, 

51
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:02,434
it remains jagged, it's not a smooth curve, you're taking these very inefficient steps 

52
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:03,180
along the circle.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,686
While that is true, and ultimately the reason things are wrong, 

54
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,828
if you want to appreciate the lesson this example is teaching us, 

55
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:13,970
the claim of the example is not that any one of these approximations equals the curve, 

56
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,160
it's that the limit of all of the approximations equals our circle.

57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,407
And to appreciate the lesson that this example teaches us, 

58
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,230
it's worth taking a moment to be a little more mathematically 

59
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,100
precise about what I mean by the limit of a sequence of curves.

60
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,517
Let's say we describe the very first shape, this square, 

61
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:34,623
as a parametric function, something that has an input t and it outputs 

62
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:39,020
a point in 2d space, so that as t ranges from 0 to 1, it traces that square.

63
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,405
I'll call that function c0, and likewise we can parameterize the next 

64
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:48,542
iteration with a function I'll call c1, as the parameter t ranges from 0 up to 1, 

65
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,800
the output of this function traces along that curve.

66
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,260
This is just so that we can think of these shapes as instead being functions.

67
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,006
Now I want you to consider a particular value of t, maybe 0.2, 

68
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,051
and then consider the sequence of points that you get by evaluating 

69
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:07,560
the sequence of functions we have at this particular point.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,200
Now I want you to consider the limit as n approaches infinity of c sub n of 0.2.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,040
This limit is a well-defined point in 2d space, in fact that point sits on the circle.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,144
And there's nothing specific about 0.2, we could do this limiting process for 

73
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:29,514
any input t, and so I can define a new function that I'll call c infinity, 

74
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:34,700
which by definition at any input t is whatever this limiting value for all the curves is.

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,023
So here's the point, that limiting function c infinity is the circle, 

76
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:44,273
it's not an approximation of the circle, it's not some jagged version of the circle, 

77
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:48,720
it is the genuine smooth circular curve whose perimeter we want to know.

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,931
And what's also true is that the limit of the lengths of all of our curves really is 8, 

79
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:58,780
because each individual curve really does have a perimeter of 8.

80
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,333
And there are all sorts of examples throughout calculus when 

81
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,189
we talk about approximating one thing we want to know as a 

82
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,240
limit of a bunch of other things that are easier to understand.

83
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,552
So the question at the heart here is why exactly 

84
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:14,100
is it not okay to do that in this example?

85
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,631
And maybe at this point you step back and say, you know, 

86
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:23,510
it's just not enough for things to look the same, this is why we need rigor, 

87
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,238
it's why we need proofs, it's why since the days of Euclid mathematicians 

88
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:31,420
have followed in his footsteps and deduced truths step by step from axioms forward.

89
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,923
But for this last example I would like to do something that 

90
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:38,426
doesn't lean as hard on visual intuition and instead give a 

91
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:42,280
Euclid style proof for the claim that all triangles are isosceles.

92
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,548
The way this will work is we'll take any particular triangle and make no assumptions 

93
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,119
about it, I'll label its vertices a, b, and c, 

94
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:53,729
and what I would like to prove for you is that the side length a, 

95
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,300
b is necessarily equal to the side length a, c.

96
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,556
Now, to be clear, the result is obviously false, 

97
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:03,407
just in the diagram I've drawn you can visually see that these lengths are 

98
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:04,640
not equal to each other.

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,447
But I challenge you to see if you can identify 

100
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,060
what's wrong about the proof I'm about to show you.

101
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,480
Honestly, it's very subtle and three gold stars for anyone who can identify it.

102
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,304
The first thing I'll do is draw the perpendicular bisector, the line bc, 

103
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:23,654
so that means this angle here is 90 degrees and this length is by definition 

104
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:27,440
the same as this length, and we'll label that intersection point d.

105
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,316
And then next I will draw the angle bisector at a, 

106
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:36,037
which means by definition this little angle here is the same as this little angle here, 

107
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:40,115
I'll label both of them alpha, and we'll say that the point where these two 

108
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:40,920
intersect is p.

109
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,261
And now, like a lot of Euclid style proofs, we're just going to draw some new lines, 

110
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,020
figure out what things must be equal, and get some conclusions.

111
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,731
For instance, let's draw the line from p which is perpendicular to the side length ac, 

112
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:56,160
and we'll label that intersection point e.

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,841
And likewise, we'll draw the line from p down to the other side length ac, 

114
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:05,760
again it's perpendicular, and we'll label that intersection point f.

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,622
My first claim is that this triangle here, which is afp, 

116
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:15,780
is the same, or at least congruent, to this triangle over here, aep.

117
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Essentially this follows from symmetry across that angle bisector.

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,722
More specifically we can say they share a side length, 

119
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,900
and then they both have an angle alpha, and both have an angle 90 degrees.

120
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,820
So it follows by the side angle angle congruence relation.

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,375
Maybe my drawing is a little bit sloppy, but the 

122
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,600
logic helps us see that they do have to be the same.

123
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,333
Next I'll draw a line from p down to b, and then from p down to c, 

124
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:46,260
and I claim that this triangle here is congruent to its reflection across that bisector.

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,977
Again the symmetry maybe helps make this clear, 

126
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:53,067
but more rigorously they both have the same base, they both have a 90 degree angle, 

127
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:57,060
and they both have the same height, so it follows by the side angle side relation.

128
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,910
So based on that first pair of triangles I'm going to mark this side length here 

129
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,200
as being the same as this side length here, marking them with double tick marks.

130
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,096
And based on the second triangle relation I'll mark this side length here 

131
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:13,140
as the same as this line over here, marking them with triple tick marks.

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,056
And so from that we have two more triangles that need to be the same, 

133
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:21,520
namely this one over here, and the one with corresponding two side lengths over here.

134
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,095
And the reasoning here is they both have that triple ticked side, 

135
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,880
a double ticked side, and they're both 90 degree triangles.

136
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,420
So this follows by the side side angle congruence relation.

137
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,578
And all of those are valid congruence relations, 

138
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:37,442
I'm not pulling the wool over your eyes with one of those, 

139
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:41,520
and all of this will basically be enough to show us why AB has to be the same as BC.

140
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,457
That first pair of triangles implies that the length AF is the same as the length AE, 

141
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:52,049
those are corresponding sides to each other, I'll just color them in red here, 

142
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,059
and then that last triangle relation guarantees for us that the side 

143
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,500
FB is going to be the same as the side EC.

144
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
I'll kind of color both of those in blue.

145
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,780
And finally the result we want basically comes from adding up these two equations.

146
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,524
The length AF plus FB is clearly the same as the total length AB, 

147
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:16,980
and likewise the length AE plus EC is the same as the total length AC.

148
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,793
So all in all the side length AB has to be the same as the side length AC, 

149
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:26,274
and because we made no assumptions about the triangle this implies that any triangle 

150
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:26,960
is isosceles.

151
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,611
Actually for that matter since we made no assumptions about the 

152
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,000
specific two sides we chose, it implies that any triangle is equilateral.

153
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,980
So this leaves us somewhat disturbingly with three different possibilities.

154
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,598
All triangles really are equilateral, that's just the truth of the universe, 

155
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,951
or you can use Euclid style reasoning to derive false results, 

156
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,080
or there's something wrong in the proof.

157
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,820
But if there is, where exactly is it?

158
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,640
So what exactly is going on with these three examples?

159
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,459
Now the thing that's a little bit troubling about that first 

160
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,564
example with the sphere is that it is very similar in spirit to 

161
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:07,960
a lot of other famous and supposedly true visual proofs from geometry.

162
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,592
For example there's a very famous proof about the area of a circle that starts 

163
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:15,308
off by dividing it into a bunch of little pizza wedges, 

164
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:18,170
and you take all those wedges and you straighten them out, 

165
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,450
essentially lining up the crust of that pizza, 

166
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,040
and then we take half the wedges and inter-slice them with the other half.

167
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,508
And the idea is that this might not be a perfect rectangle, 

168
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:32,002
it's got some bumps and curves, but as you take thinner and thinner slices you get 

169
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,034
something that's closer and closer to a true rectangle, 

170
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,419
and the width of that rectangle comes from half the circumference of the circle, 

171
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,184
which is by definition pi times r, and then the height of that rectangle comes from the 

172
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:47,920
radius of the circle, r, meaning that the whole area is pi r squared.

173
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,669
This time the result is valid, but why is it not okay to do what we did with the spheres, 

174
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,700
but somehow it is okay to do this with the pizza slices?

175
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,377
The main problem with the sphere argument is that when we flatten out all 

176
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,731
of those orange wedges, if we were to do it accurately in a way that 

177
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,620
preserves their area, they don't look like triangles, they should bulge outward.

178
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,593
And if you want to see this, let's think really critically about just one particular 

179
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:18,372
one of those wedges on the sphere, and ask yourself how does the width across that wedge, 

180
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:22,620
this little portion of a line of latitude, vary as you go up and down the wedge?

181
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,633
In particular, if you consider the angle phi from the z-axis down to a point on 

182
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:32,540
this wedge as we walk down it, what's the length of that width as a function of phi?

183
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,352
For those of you curious about the details of these sorts of things, 

184
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:40,704
you'd start off by drawing this line up here from the z-axis to a point on the wedge, 

185
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:44,500
its length will be the radius of the sphere r times the sine of this angle.

186
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,423
That lets us deduce how long the total line of latitude is where we're sitting, 

187
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:53,472
it'll basically be 2 pi times that radial line, 2 pi r sine of phi, 

188
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:58,652
and then the width of the wedge that we care about is just some constant proportion of 

189
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,260
that full line of latitude.

190
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,484
Now the details don't matter too much, the one thing I want 

191
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:06,120
you to notice is that this is not a linear relationship.

192
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,875
As you walk from the top of that wedge down to the bottom, 

193
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:14,970
letting phi range from 0 up to pi halves, the width of the wedge doesn't grow linearly, 

194
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,460
instead it grows according to a sine curve.

195
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,873
And so when we're unwrapping all of these wedges, 

196
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,745
if we want those widths to be preserved, they should end up 

197
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:27,240
a little bit chubbier around the base, their side lengths are not linear.

198
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,933
What this means is when we tried to interlace all of the wedges from the northern 

199
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:35,653
hemisphere with those from the southern, there's a meaningful amount of overlap 

200
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:39,698
between those non-linear edges, and we can't wave our hands about a limiting argument, 

201
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:43,140
this is an overlap that persists as you take finer and finer subdivisions.

202
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,498
And ultimately it's that overlap that accounts for the difference between 

203
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,940
our false answer with a pi squared from the true answer that has 4 pi.

204
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,478
It reminds me of one of those rearrangement puzzles where you have a number of 

205
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:59,280
pieces and just by moving them around you can seemingly create area out of nowhere.

206
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,133
For example, right now I've arranged all these pieces to form a triangle, 

207
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,560
except it's missing two units of area in the middle.

208
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,648
Now I want you to focus on the vertices of that triangle, these white dots, 

209
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:12,494
those don't move, I'm not pulling any trickery with that, 

210
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:16,665
but I can rearrange all of the pieces back to how they originally were so that those 

211
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:19,167
two units of area in the middle seem to disappear, 

212
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:23,141
while the constituent parts remain the same, the triangle that they form remains 

213
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:26,380
the same, and yet two units of area seem to appear out of nowhere.

214
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,238
If you've never seen this one before, by the way, 

215
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:31,652
I highly encourage you to pause and try to think it through, 

216
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,840
it's a very fun little puzzle.

217
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,936
The answer starts to reveal itself if we carefully draw the edges of this triangle and 

218
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:43,838
zoom in close enough to see that our pieces don't actually fit inside the triangle, 

219
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:48,914
they bulge out ever so slightly, or at least arranged like this they bulge out ever so 

220
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:49,440
slightly.

221
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,474
When we rearrange them and we zoom back in we can see that they dent 

222
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:57,228
inward ever so slightly, and that very subtle difference between the 

223
00:13:57,228 --> 00:14:01,200
bulge out and the dent inward accounts for all of the difference in area.

224
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,806
The slope of the edge of this blue triangle works out to be 5 divided by 2, 

225
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:10,280
whereas the slope of the edge of this red triangle works out to be 7 divided by 3.

226
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,330
Those numbers are close enough to look similar as slope, 

227
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,260
but they allow for this denting inward and the bulging outward.

228
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,737
You have to be wary of lines that are made to look straight when 

229
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:22,880
you haven't had explicit confirmation that they actually are straight.

230
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,056
One quick added comment on the sphere, the fundamental issue here is that the geometry 

231
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:33,140
of a curved surface is fundamentally different from the geometry of flat space.

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,000
The relevant search term here would be Gaussian curvature.

233
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,420
You can't flatten things out from a sphere without losing geometric information.

234
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,511
When you see limiting arguments that relate to little pieces on a sphere that 

235
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,583
somehow get flattened out and are reasoned through there, 

236
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,873
those only can work if the limiting pieces that you're talking about get smaller 

237
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:53,880
in both directions.

238
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,420
It's only when you zoom in close to curved surface that it appears locally flat.

239
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,637
The issue with our orange wedge argument is that our pieces never got 

240
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:06,320
exposed to that local flatness because they only got thin in one direction.

241
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,800
They maintain the curvature in that other direction.

242
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,423
Now on the topic of the subtlety of limiting arguments, 

243
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:16,860
let's turn back to our limit of jagged curves that approaches the smooth circular curve.

244
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,555
As I said, the limiting curve really is a circle and the 

245
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:24,360
limiting value for the length of your approximations really is 8.

246
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,479
Here, the basic issue is that there is no reason to expect that the limit of 

247
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:33,581
the lengths of the curves is the same as the length of the limits of the curves, 

248
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:37,380
and in fact this is a nice counter example to show why that's not the case.

249
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,098
The real point of this example is not the fear that anyone is ever 

250
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:45,063
going to believe that it shows that pi is equal to 4, 

251
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:49,016
instead it shows why care is required in other cases where people apply 

252
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,060
limiting arguments.

253
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,920
For example, this happens all throughout calculus.

254
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,700
It is the heart of calculus, where say you want to know the area under a given curve.

255
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,507
The way we typically think about it is to approximate that with a set of rectangles, 

256
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:05,740
because those are the things we know how to compute the areas of.

257
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,800
You just take the base times height in each case.

258
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,219
Now this is a very jagged approximation, but the thought, or I guess the hope, 

259
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:16,777
is that as you take a finer and finer subdivision into thinner and thinner rectangles, 

260
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:20,340
the sums of those areas approaches the thing we actually care about.

261
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,850
If you want to make it rigorous, you have to be explicit about the error between 

262
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,940
these approximations and the true thing we care about, the area under this curve.

263
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,877
For example, you might start your argument by saying that that 

264
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:36,220
error has to be strictly less than the area of these red rectangles.

265
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,443
Essentially, the deviation between the curve and our 

266
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:42,700
approximating rectangles sits strictly inside that red region.

267
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,260
And then what you would want to argue is that in this limiting process, 

268
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,340
the cumulative area of all of those red rectangles has to approach zero.

269
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,800
Now as to the final example, our proof that all triangles are isosceles, 

270
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,388
let me show you what it looks like if I'm a little bit more careful about 

271
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:07,880
actually constructing the angle bisector rather than just eyeballing it.

272
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,579
When I do that, the relevant intersection point actually sits outside of the triangle.

273
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,033
And then from there, if I go through everything that we did in the original argument, 

274
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:19,522
drawing the relevant perpendicular lines, all of that, 

275
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:22,420
every triangle that I claimed was congruent really is congruent.

276
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,331
All of those were genuinely true, and the corresponding lengths of 

277
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:28,040
those triangles that I claimed were the same really are the same.

278
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,839
The one place where the proof breaks down is at the very end, 

279
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,200
when I said that the full side length AC was equal to AE plus EC.

280
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,460
That was only true under the hidden assumption that that point E sat in between them.

281
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,120
But in reality, for many triangles, that point would sit outside of those two.

282
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,580
It's pretty subtle, isn't it?

283
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,124
The point in all of this is that while visual intuition is great, 

284
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:59,688
and visual proofs often give you a nice way of elucidating what's going on with 

285
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:04,479
otherwise opaque rigor, visual arguments and snazzy diagrams will never obviate the 

286
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,020
need for critical thinking.

287
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,760
In math, you cannot escape the need to look out for hidden assumptions and edge cases.

288
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,980
Thank you.
