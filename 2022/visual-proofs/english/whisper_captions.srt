00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
Today I'd like to share with you three fake proofs in increasing order of subtlety,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,200
and then discuss what each one of them has to tell us about math.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,020
The first proof is for a formula for the surface area of a sphere,

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,300
and the way that it starts is to subdivide that sphere into vertical slices,

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,120
the way you might chop up an orange or paint a beach ball.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,100
We then unravel all of those wedge slices from the northern hemisphere,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
so that they poke up like this,

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,640
and then symmetrically unravel all of those from the southern hemisphere below,

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,320
and now interlace those pieces to get a shape whose area we want to figure out.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,700
The base of this shape came from the circumference of the sphere,

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,380
it's an unraveled equator, so its length is 2 pi times the radius of the sphere,

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,000
and then the other side of this shape came from the height of one of these wedges,

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,040
which is a quarter of a walk around the sphere, and so it has a length of pi halves times r.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,340
The idea is that this is only an approximation, the edges might not be perfectly straight,

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,920
but if we think of the limit as we do finer and finer slices of the sphere,

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,100
this shape whose area we want to know gets closer to being a perfect rectangle,

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,100
one whose area will be pi halves r times 2 pi r, or in other words pi squared times r squared.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,520
The proof is elegant, it translates a hard problem into a situation that's easier to understand,

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,880
it has that element of surprise while still being intuitive,

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,980
its only fault, really, is that it's completely wrong,

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,460
the true surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r squared.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,600
I originally saw this example thanks to Henry Reich, and to be fair,

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,500
it's not necessarily inconsistent with the 4 pi r squared formula, just so long as pi is equal to 4.

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,640
For the next proof I'd like to show you a simple argument for the fact that pi is equal to 4.

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,560
We start off with a circle, say with radius 1, and we ask how can we figure out its circumference,

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,420
after all, pi is by definition the ratio of this circumference to the diameter of the circle.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,760
We start off by drawing the square whose side lengths are all tangent to that circle.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,360
It's not too hard to see that the perimeter of this square is 8.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,260
Then, and some of you may have seen this before, it's a kind of classic argument,

30
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,300
the argument proceeds by producing a sequence of curves,

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,420
all of whom also have this perimeter of 8, but which more and more closely approximate the circle.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,060
But the full nuance of this example is not always emphasized.

33
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,700
First of all, just to make things crystal clear, the way each of these iterations works is to fold

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,900
in each of the corners of the previous shape so that they just barely kiss the circle,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,020
and you can take a moment to convince yourself that in each region where a fold happened,

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,020
the perimeter doesn't change. For example, in the upper right here,

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,460
instead of walking up and then left, the new curve goes left and then up.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,560
And something similar is true at all of the folds of all of the different iterations.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,080
Wherever the previous iteration went direction A then direction B,

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,900
the new iteration goes direction B then direction A, but no length is lost or gained.

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,300
Some of you might say, well obviously this isn't going to give the true perimeter of the circle,

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,300
because no matter how many iterations you do, when you zoom in, it remains jagged,

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,180
it's not a smooth curve, you're taking these very inefficient steps along the circle.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,420
While that is true, and ultimately the reason things are wrong,

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,380
if you want to appreciate the lesson this example is teaching us,

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,760
the claim of the example is not that any one of these approximations equals the curve,

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,160
it's that the limit of all of the approximations equals our circle.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,180
And to appreciate the lesson that this example teaches us,

49
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,040
it's worth taking a moment to be a little more mathematically precise

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,100
about what I mean by the limit of a sequence of curves.

51
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,340
Let's say we describe the very first shape, this square, as a parametric function,

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,540
something that has an input t and it outputs a point in 2d space,

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,020
so that as t ranges from 0 to 1, it traces that square.

54
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,040
I'll call that function c0, and likewise we can parameterize the next iteration

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,540
with a function I'll call c1, as the parameter t ranges from 0 up to 1,

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,800
the output of this function traces along that curve.

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,260
This is just so that we can think of these shapes as instead being functions.

58
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,220
Now I want you to consider a particular value of t, maybe 0.2,

59
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,120
and then consider the sequence of points that you get

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
by evaluating the sequence of functions we have at this particular point.

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,200
Now I want you to consider the limit as n approaches infinity of c sub n of 0.2.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,040
This limit is a well-defined point in 2d space, in fact that point sits on the circle.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,620
And there's nothing specific about 0.2, we could do this limiting process for any input t,

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,180
and so I can define a new function that I'll call c infinity,

65
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,700
which by definition at any input t is whatever this limiting value for all the curves is.

66
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,600
So here's the point, that limiting function c infinity is the circle,

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,300
it's not an approximation of the circle, it's not some jagged version of the circle,

68
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,720
it is the genuine smooth circular curve whose perimeter we want to know.

69
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,180
And what's also true is that the limit of the lengths of all of our curves really is 8,

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,780
because each individual curve really does have a perimeter of 8.

71
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,920
And there are all sorts of examples throughout calculus

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,920
when we talk about approximating one thing we want to know

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,240
as a limit of a bunch of other things that are easier to understand.

74
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,100
So the question at the heart here is why exactly is it not okay to do that in this example?

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,040
And maybe at this point you step back and say, you know,

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,680
it's just not enough for things to look the same, this is why we need rigor, it's why we need proofs,

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,880
it's why since the days of Euclid mathematicians have followed in his footsteps

78
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,420
and deduced truths step by step from axioms forward.

79
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,100
But for this last example I would like to do something that doesn't lean as hard on visual

80
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,280
intuition and instead give a Euclid style proof for the claim that all triangles are isosceles.

81
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,060
The way this will work is we'll take any particular triangle and make no assumptions about it,

82
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll label its vertices a, b, and c, and what I would like to prove for you

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,300
is that the side length a, b is necessarily equal to the side length a, c.

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,380
Now, to be clear, the result is obviously false, just in the diagram I've drawn you can visually

85
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,180
see that these lengths are not equal to each other. But I challenge you to see if you can

86
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,220
identify what's wrong about the proof I'm about to show you. Honestly, it's very subtle and three

87
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,320
gold stars for anyone who can identify it. The first thing I'll do is draw the perpendicular

88
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,940
bisector, the line bc, so that means this angle here is 90 degrees and this length is by definition

89
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,620
the same as this length, and we'll label that intersection point d. And then next I will draw

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,640
the angle bisector at a, which means by definition this little angle here is the same as this little

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,940
angle here, I'll label both of them alpha, and we'll say that the point where these two intersect

92
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,600
is p. And now, like a lot of Euclid style proofs, we're just going to draw some new lines, figure

93
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,200
out what things must be equal, and get some conclusions. For instance, let's draw the line

94
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,160
from p which is perpendicular to the side length ac, and we'll label that intersection point e.

95
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,280
And likewise, we'll draw the line from p down to the other side length ac, again it's perpendicular,

96
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,060
and we'll label that intersection point f. My first claim is that this triangle here,

97
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,980
which is afp, is the same, or at least congruent, to this triangle over here, aep. Essentially this

98
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,400
follows from symmetry across that angle bisector. More specifically we can say they share a side

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,580
length, and then they both have an angle alpha, and both have an angle 90 degrees. So it follows

100
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,580
by the side angle angle congruence relation. Maybe my drawing is a little bit sloppy, but the logic

101
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,820
helps us see that they do have to be the same. Next I'll draw a line from p down to b, and then

102
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:45,140
from p down to c, and I claim that this triangle here is congruent to its reflection across that

103
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,440
bisector. Again the symmetry maybe helps make this clear, but more rigorously they both have

104
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,220
the same base, they both have a 90 degree angle, and they both have the same height, so it follows

105
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,120
by the side angle side relation. So based on that first pair of triangles I'm going to mark this

106
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,200
side length here as being the same as this side length here, marking them with double tick marks.

107
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,560
And based on the second triangle relation I'll mark this side length here as the same as this

108
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
line over here, marking them with triple tick marks. And so from that we have two more triangles

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,380
that need to be the same, namely this one over here, and the one with corresponding two side

110
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,800
lengths over here. And the reasoning here is they both have that triple ticked side, a double ticked

111
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,040
side, and they're both 90 degree triangles. So this follows by the side side angle congruence

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,740
relation. And all of those are valid congruence relations, I'm not pulling the wool over your eyes

113
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,140
with one of those, and all of this will basically be enough to show us why AB has to be the same as

114
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,700
BC. That first pair of triangles implies that the length AF is the same as the length AE, those are

115
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,580
corresponding sides to each other, I'll just color them in red here, and then that last triangle

116
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,660
relation guarantees for us that the side FB is going to be the same as the side EC. I'll kind of

117
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,240
color both of those in blue. And finally the result we want basically comes from adding up these two

118
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,860
equations. The length AF plus FB is clearly the same as the total length AB, and likewise the length

119
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,700
AE plus EC is the same as the total length AC. So all in all the side length AB has to be the same

120
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,340
as the side length AC, and because we made no assumptions about the triangle this implies that

121
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,440
any triangle is isosceles. Actually for that matter since we made no assumptions about the specific

122
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,800
two sides we chose, it implies that any triangle is equilateral. So this leaves us somewhat

123
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,600
disturbingly with three different possibilities. All triangles really are equilateral, that's just

124
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,520
the truth of the universe, or you can use Euclid style reasoning to derive false results, or

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,820
there's something wrong in the proof. But if there is, where exactly is it?

126
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,540
So what exactly is going on with these three examples? Now the thing that's a little bit

127
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,700
troubling about that first example with the sphere is that it is very similar in spirit to a lot of

128
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,920
other famous and supposedly true visual proofs from geometry. For example there's a very famous

129
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,240
proof about the area of a circle that starts off by dividing it into a bunch of little pizza wedges,

130
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,680
and you take all those wedges and you straighten them out, essentially lining up the crust of that

131
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,820
pizza, and then we take half the wedges and inter-slice them with the other half. And the idea

132
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,500
is that this might not be a perfect rectangle, it's got some bumps and curves, but as you take

133
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,060
thinner and thinner slices you get something that's closer and closer to a true rectangle,

134
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,040
and the width of that rectangle comes from half the circumference of the circle, which is by

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,140
definition pi times r, and then the height of that rectangle comes from the radius of the circle, r,

136
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,160
meaning that the whole area is pi r squared. This time the result is valid, but why is it not okay

137
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,700
to do what we did with the spheres, but somehow it is okay to do this with the pizza slices?

138
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,100
The main problem with the sphere argument is that when we flatten out all of those orange wedges,

139
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,820
if we were to do it accurately in a way that preserves their area, they don't look like

140
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,320
triangles, they should bulge outward. And if you want to see this, let's think really critically

141
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,340
about just one particular one of those wedges on the sphere, and ask yourself how does the width

142
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:22,620
across that wedge, this little portion of a line of latitude, vary as you go up and down the wedge?

143
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,160
In particular, if you consider the angle phi from the z-axis down to a point on this wedge as we

144
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,960
walk down it, what's the length of that width as a function of phi? For those of you curious about

145
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,220
the details of these sorts of things, you'd start off by drawing this line up here from the z-axis

146
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,100
to a point on the wedge, its length will be the radius of the sphere r times the sine of this

147
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,880
angle. That lets us deduce how long the total line of latitude is where we're sitting,

148
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,840
it'll basically be 2 pi times that radial line, 2 pi r sine of phi, and then the width of the wedge

149
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,260
that we care about is just some constant proportion of that full line of latitude. Now the details

150
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,120
don't matter too much, the one thing I want you to notice is that this is not a linear relationship.

151
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,780
As you walk from the top of that wedge down to the bottom, letting phi range from 0 up to pi halves,

152
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,460
the width of the wedge doesn't grow linearly, instead it grows according to a sine curve.

153
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,140
And so when we're unwrapping all of these wedges, if we want those widths to be preserved,

154
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,240
they should end up a little bit chubbier around the base, their side lengths are not linear.

155
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,740
What this means is when we tried to interlace all of the wedges from the northern hemisphere

156
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,820
with those from the southern, there's a meaningful amount of overlap between those non-linear edges,

157
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,820
and we can't wave our hands about a limiting argument, this is an overlap that persists

158
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,100
as you take finer and finer subdivisions. And ultimately it's that overlap that accounts for

159
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,940
the difference between our false answer with a pi squared from the true answer that has 4 pi.

160
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,920
It reminds me of one of those rearrangement puzzles where you have a number of pieces and

161
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
just by moving them around you can seemingly create area out of nowhere. For example,

162
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,960
right now I've arranged all these pieces to form a triangle, except it's missing two units of area

163
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,180
in the middle. Now I want you to focus on the vertices of that triangle, these white dots,

164
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,780
those don't move, I'm not pulling any trickery with that, but I can rearrange all of the pieces

165
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,460
back to how they originally were so that those two units of area in the middle seem to disappear,

166
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,260
while the constituent parts remain the same, the triangle that they form remains the same,

167
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,440
and yet two units of area seem to appear out of nowhere. If you've never seen this one before,

168
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,540
by the way, I highly encourage you to pause and try to think it through, it's a very fun little

169
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,500
puzzle. The answer starts to reveal itself if we carefully draw the edges of this triangle

170
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,460
and zoom in close enough to see that our pieces don't actually fit inside the triangle,

171
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,440
they bulge out ever so slightly, or at least arranged like this they bulge out ever so slightly.

172
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,780
When we rearrange them and we zoom back in we can see that they dent inward ever so slightly,

173
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,440
and that very subtle difference between the bulge out and the dent inward accounts for all of the

174
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,880
difference in area. The slope of the edge of this blue triangle works out to be 5 divided by 2,

175
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,280
whereas the slope of the edge of this red triangle works out to be 7 divided by 3.

176
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,200
Those numbers are close enough to look similar as slope, but they allow for this denting inward

177
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,860
and the bulging outward. You have to be wary of lines that are made to look straight when you

178
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,640
haven't had explicit confirmation that they actually are straight. One quick added comment

179
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,020
on the sphere, the fundamental issue here is that the geometry of a curved surface is fundamentally

180
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,460
different from the geometry of flat space. The relevant search term here would be Gaussian

181
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,420
curvature. You can't flatten things out from a sphere without losing geometric information.

182
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,400
When you see limiting arguments that relate to little pieces on a sphere that somehow get

183
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,060
flattened out and are reasoned through there, those only can work if the limiting pieces

184
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,740
that you're talking about get smaller in both directions. It's only when you zoom in close to

185
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,760
curved surface that it appears locally flat. The issue with our orange wedge argument is that our

186
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,320
pieces never got exposed to that local flatness because they only got thin in one direction.

187
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,340
They maintain the curvature in that other direction. Now on the topic of the subtlety of

188
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,460
limiting arguments, let's turn back to our limit of jagged curves that approaches the smooth circular

189
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,140
curve. As I said, the limiting curve really is a circle and the limiting value for the length of

190
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:29,040
your approximations really is 8. Here, the basic issue is that there is no reason to expect that

191
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,480
the limit of the lengths of the curves is the same as the length of the limits of the curves,

192
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,520
and in fact this is a nice counter example to show why that's not the case. The real point of this

193
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,120
example is not the fear that anyone is ever going to believe that it shows that pi is equal to 4,

194
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,060
instead it shows why care is required in other cases where people apply limiting arguments.

195
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,520
For example, this happens all throughout calculus. It is the heart of calculus,

196
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,160
where say you want to know the area under a given curve. The way we typically think about it is to

197
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
approximate that with a set of rectangles, because those are the things we know how to compute the

198
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,140
areas of. You just take the base times height in each case. Now this is a very jagged approximation,

199
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,160
but the thought, or I guess the hope, is that as you take a finer and finer subdivision into

200
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,340
thinner and thinner rectangles, the sums of those areas approaches the thing we actually care about.

201
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,260
If you want to make it rigorous, you have to be explicit about the error between these

202
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,480
approximations and the true thing we care about, the area under this curve. For example, you might

203
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,580
start your argument by saying that that error has to be strictly less than the area of these red

204
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,940
rectangles. Essentially, the deviation between the curve and our approximating rectangles sits

205
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,880
strictly inside that red region. And then what you would want to argue is that in this limiting

206
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,340
process, the cumulative area of all of those red rectangles has to approach zero.

207
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,120
Now as to the final example, our proof that all triangles are isosceles, let me show you what it

208
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,640
looks like if I'm a little bit more careful about actually constructing the angle bisector rather

209
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,860
than just eyeballing it. When I do that, the relevant intersection point actually sits outside

210
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,980
of the triangle. And then from there, if I go through everything that we did in the original

211
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,480
argument, drawing the relevant perpendicular lines, all of that, every triangle that I claimed

212
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,220
was congruent really is congruent. All of those were genuinely true, and the corresponding lengths

213
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,880
of those triangles that I claimed were the same really are the same. The one place where the proof

214
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,200
breaks down is at the very end, when I said that the full side length AC was equal to AE plus EC.

215
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,140
That was only true under the hidden assumption that that point E sat in between them. But in

216
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,580
reality, for many triangles, that point would sit outside of those two. It's pretty subtle, isn't it?

217
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,720
The point in all of this is that while visual intuition is great, and visual proofs often give

218
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,320
you a nice way of elucidating what's going on with otherwise opaque rigor, visual arguments

219
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,860
and snazzy diagrams will never obviate the need for critical thinking. In math,

220
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,760
you cannot escape the need to look out for hidden assumptions and edge cases.

221
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:40,900
Thank you.
