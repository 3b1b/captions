  "input": "that is such a fantastic question, Max and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication you're not, I'll just draw it out for you actually this is going to be easiest if we have some kind of exponential relationship let's say 10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000 there's three different numbers at play here showing a relationship between the 10, the 3, and the 1000 and aside from writing it with an exponent there's two other ways we could write that same relationship we could also say that the cube root of 1000 is equal to 10 this is asking 1000, what number raised to the third is equal to 1000 that's sort of what the cube root is asking and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3 three different notations, the same exact relationship a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship between the three numbers with a triangle where you'd have our 10 sitting down here the power sitting at the top, 10 to the third and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right and whenever you want to talk about a function or an operation between two of these numbers you indicate which one of them you're leaving out so to write 10 cubed, we would include the 10 on the lower left the 3 on the upper right, and then we leave out that bottom one so this is indicating that we're taking a power, 10 cubed for that radical, what you would say is we know what's on the bottom right something to some power equals 1000 we even know what the power is something cubed equals that 1000 but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation where if the thing you don't know instead of being on that bottom right is on the bottom left but what logarithms are, it's an inverse in another sense because what it's saying is, in this triangle relationship we know the base, it's 10 we know the power that it should be, 1000 but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent so to answer your question maybe even more briefly we could say that 10 to the x, the inverse of that the inverse is the log base 10 you know, of y, of some other variable whereas if you're taking x to the 10th, some unknown raised to a power the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value and on the triangle it's basically asking which of the things do we consider to be a variable so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity are you considering that top to be a variable quantity and what is the unknown but I really liked this idea of making explicit how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers one of them we introduce a new symbol, this radical and one of them we introduce a new word, log so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation and while I don't necessarily think that we should teach logarithms with this triangle because convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression what I do like about it and starting off with it is when you see and think about this triangle it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that exponent every time that you see log of some value you should think in your mind, okay, whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent it wants to be an exponent and we'll see more of what that means as we go on okay, so every time you see a log it wants to be an exponent this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is now in terms of convention for the first part of this video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it to be the shorthand for log base 10 because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there you should know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e there's also another notation for that ln for natural log we're going to talk all about the natural log next time so don't worry too much about that right now and there's also yet another convention often if you're in a computer science setting log without any added sugar to indicate what it is defaults to meaning log base 2 so this can sometimes be a source of confusion but it basically depends on what discipline you're in in math, not moth, math people really like a base of e, we'll see why next lecture in, I don't know, I'll say engineering but really it's anything where you want good intuition with our normal base 10 number system log means log base 10 and if you're curious, often in computer science settings log base 2 comes up all the time so, like I said, in the back of your mind if you're trying to think of some of these properties just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number that can get you a really far way so we're going to start going through a couple of these properties and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples so we'll transition away from the pole and this time to the first proper question and the question asks you which

  "input": "none of the above and remember like I said earlier we should fully expect that all of those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well they're going to be answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly but if you're someone who doesn't, don't let that intimidate you when you're looking at a problem like this one what I would encourage you to do is just plug in various powers of 10 and think in terms of the idea that the log function counts the number of zeros so I'll give you a little moment to think about that so I'll go ahead and grade it and as always if that's faster than what you're comfortable with know that it's only because I want to proceed forward with the lesson so in this case the correct answer comes out to be log of 1000 times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x and now let's think about that for a moment and like I said when you're just getting started with them I think the best thing to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers and the best numbers to plug in are the ones that are already powers of 10 so if you're asking something like log of 1000 times x well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x log of 1000 times 100 well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here well 1000 times 100 is 100,000 we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10 we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000 the 2 zeros from that 100 and we're putting them next to each other so it should be 5 total zeros but if you really reflect not just on how did the number turn out but why did it turn out that way it was the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100 which we could also write by saying the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100 so this idea that a logarithm of the product of two things is the sum of the logarithms of those two things in the context of powers of 10 that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive idea for a lot of us if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them you just take all of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other so the way I've written things out here it's actually indicative of a slightly more general fact which is going to be our very first property of logarithms which is that if we take the log of A times B it equals the log of A plus the log of B now any time you see one of these logarithm rules if you find yourself squinting your eyes or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it just plug in examples I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot but it's because I think it's very easy to forget once you're swamped in the algebra itself and you're sitting on some kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols to remind yourself you are okay to just plug in some numbers that's a fine thing to do and often it's a great way to yield intuition so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart we could just think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000 which is 5, there's 5 zeros in it breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part great, wonderful so carrying that intuition further let's try another practice problem and again, if you know it, great, you'll be able to answer it fine but maybe think, not just what is the answer but how would I explain this answer to someone or how would I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own without me having to tell them what the answer is so there's two potential audience members there's those who are interested in the lesson itself and then those who are interested in the meta lesson so our question asks, again, which of the following is true?

  "input": "so the correct answer here is a, which it looks like 4,000 of you got congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x so, again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself I think a fine place to start is plugging something in and in this case, for log of x to the power n let's just try it with 100 to the power 3 and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way sometimes one example will do because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking well, that's 3 copies of 100 I'm taking 3 copies of 100 and when I multiply all that out and I think of log as counting the number of zeros we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100 I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together to get a million so this number is going to be 6 but if we think actually why was it 6 not just that's the number of zeros inside the million where that 6 came from is that we had 3 copies of that 100 and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros so that way it's a more general way you can think about it where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking at 1000 cubed or 1000 to the n or x to the power n you can think that it's whatever that value of n was the number of copies we were multiplying in times the number of well, let's see, it's not x times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted for x which in this case was 100 so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 to the power n this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000 counting the number of zeros in each one of them which is 4 so it would be n times 4 and of course the general property that most of you correctly answered is that you have this lovely little effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power that little power hops down in front of it and you just have log of what was on the inside now one of the maybe most important implications of that I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition if I'm taking log and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10 of 10 to the power n we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10 which is of course 1 this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at the end or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10 and the answer is simply 1 which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n oh well the answer is n ok now with every given logarithm property that we have so in this case we just found one log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves a little bit of intuition for these so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here try to hide where we're going what we just found raising something to the n that hops in front this corresponds to the exponential property that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms which is they kind of they're like exponentiation turned inside out and here's what I mean by that the thing sitting on the inside of the log if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for something that's exponential in this case the a the thing on the inside corresponds to 10 to the x the output of the function whereas the entire thing itself the log of a corresponds to what's on the inside over here just what's the exponent of the 10 so wherever you see a log expression here you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side and every time you see an exponential the entire 10 to the x expression the whole outer component on the right side that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs and we saw this above the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside that's adding on the outside well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out that's telling us that multiplying on the outside multiplying the outputs of the function is the same as adding on the inside because each of these logs like log a and log b is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right so with that let's keep playing let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for so this last one, very nice thinking of exponents hopping down the next one is something that might look a little bit weird to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it and we'll give it a little bit more a moment to pull up which of the following is true?

  "translatedText": "所以这里的正确答案是a，看起 来你们中有4,000人恭喜 ，告诉我们x的n次方对数等 于x的n倍对数，所以，再一次 ，假设您正在尝试教这个对于 某人，或者如果你想自己理解 它的含义，我认为一个很好的起 点是插入一些东西，在这种情 况下，对于 x 的 log 的 n 次方，让我们尝试使 用 100 次方3、你可以 尝试与其他模式一起尝试，看 看你正在做的模式是否真的有效 ，但如果你仔细思考，不是简 单地看到答案是什么，而是试 图思考为什么答案是这样的有时 一个例子就可以了，因为 1 00 的立方，我们可以认为 这是很好的，这是 100 的 3 个副本，我取 100 的 3 个副本，当我将所 有这些相乘时，我认为对数就是 计算零的数量，我们说，哦， 这将是一个只有 6 个零的 数字，这就是 100 乘以 100 乘以 100 的意 思 我可以想到将所有这些零 组合在一起得到一百万，所以这 个数字将是6 但如果我们实 际上思考为什么是 6，不仅 仅是 6 所来自的百万个零 的数量，而是我们有 3 个 100 个副本，而这 10 0 个中的每一个都有 2 个不同的零，这样它就更通用了 你可以这样想，如果我们不是 取 100 的立方，而是看 1000 的立方或 100 0 的 n 次方或 x 的 n 次方，你可以认为 n 的值就是我们乘以倍数的副本 数井的数量，让我们看看，它 不是 x 乘以我们用 x 代替的任何内容中的零数量，在 本例中是 100，所以如果 我取 10,000 的 l og 的 n 次方，这将是相 同的取这 10,000 个 副本的 n 个副本，计算每 个副本中零的数量，即 4，所 以这将是 n 乘以 4，当 然，你们大多数人正确回答的 一般属性是，当您看到某物的日 志升到了一个幂，在它前面几 乎没有幂跳下来，你就得到了 里面的日志，现在这可能是最重 要的含义之一，我不知道你是 否会称之为它一个暗示，或者 如果你称它为定义的重述，如果 我取对数，我只是重新强调它 是 10 的 n 次方的基 数，我们可以将那个小 n 视为向下跳跃前面，它变成以 10 为底的对数的 n 倍 ，当然是 1 这个表达式你 可以认为是计算末尾零的数量， 或者更一般地说，它要求 1 0 到等于 10 的数，答 案就是 1这是非常令人放心的 ，因为你可以返回并阅读这个 原始表达式的另一种方式是说 10 等于 10 的 n 哦，好吧，现在对于我们拥有 的每个给定的对数属性，答案 是不行的，所以在这种情况下我 们刚刚发现 x 的 n 次 方对数涉及 n 在前面跳跃 ，总是会存在镜像指数属性，这 是我们可以帮助自己对这些有 一点直觉的另一种方式，所以 让我掩盖一下我们将要到达的一 些未来属性尝试隐藏我们刚刚 发现的内容，将某些内容提升 到前面的 n，这对应于指数属 性，如果我将 10 代入 x 并提高整件事的 n 次 幂与 10 的 n 次 x 相同，这让我们对对数有另一 种直觉，它们有点像指数翻转 ，这就是我的意思如果我取 a 的对数，那么位于日志内部 的东西应该将其视为指数级的 东西的整个外部表达式，在这 种情况下，a 内部的东西对应 于 10 到 x函数的输出 ，而整个事情本身 a 的对 数对应于里面的内容，这里只是 10 的指数，所以无论你 在这里看到一个对数表达式， 你都应该认为它扮演了右边指数 的角色每当你看到一个指数时 ，整个 10 到 x 表达 式右侧的整个外部组件对应于位 于其中一个日志内部的东西， 我们在上面看到了这个想法， 当我们相乘时如果对数是从内到 外的转指数，那就告诉我们， 在外部相乘与函数的输出相乘 与在内部相加是一样的，因为每 个对数都像 log a 和 log b在右边的表达式 中扮演 x 和 y 的角色， 所以让我们继续玩，让我们再 做几个这样的操作，看看我们 可以对其中多少属性建立直觉， 所以最后一个，对于那些不一 定熟悉对数的人来说，指数跳 到下一个的想法可能有点奇怪， 但再次插入一些数字以获得一 些直觉，我们将给出一点请稍 等一下，以下哪项是正确的？",

  "input": "but as we get even more intense into this 5 and 6 range which were well above the atom bomb scale now we're only merely at around 2 per day and I'm sure that a geologist could come in and explain why we all shouldn't be super worried about the fact that there's two atom bomb equivalent disruptions to the earth's crust happening every day but presumably it's particularly rare for those to be concentrated on some spot like a city where lots of people live now just verifying our thought that each step involves a growth of 32 let's look at what the step from 6 up to 7 looks like and here it's giving us lots more examples in between maybe giving the illusion that that's a bigger step than it actually is and indeed that's the difference between 1 megaton and 32 megatons so that's multiplying by 32 one of the things I found most interesting on this chart by the way was look at how far we have to go before we get to the largest nuclear weapon that's ever actually been tested this was height of the cold war the Tsar bomb that was 50 megatons and I believe they actually had original plans to have a 100 megaton bomb but talked themselves down from that 50 megatons, we're talking start off at that 32 kilotons of the Nagasaki bomb multiply by 32 to get a megaton multiply by another 32 so we're talking about a thousand times the strength of the World War II ending explosion and you're still not at the 50 megatons of what humanity is capable of and that is evidently the Java earthquake of Indonesia so 7.0 is not just a little bit bigger than 6.0, it's a lot bigger and the point here of course is just that when you have a scale giving you multiplicative increases it's worth appreciating that what look like small steps can actually be huge steps in terms of the energy implied or the absolute values implied here so when we're thinking about the fact that there was ever a 9.5 that actually seems absurd given that it's only in the 7.0 range that we're talking about the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out and this is indicative of one area where logarithms tend to come about it's when humans want to create a scale for something that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be so in the case of size of earthquakes you can have things from what happens just all the time around the Earth, the size of a large hand grenade and you want that to be on your scale and something to think about ranging all the way up to the largest disruption that we've seen in human history and in order to have that in a way that you're not just writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case and a whole bunch of different, a smaller number of digits for your number in another case it's nice to take logarithms and then just put that on a single scale that basically squishes those numbers between 0 and 10 you see something very similar going on with the decibel scale for music that one actually works a little bit differently where every time you take a step up of 10 decibels that corresponds to multiplying by 10 so rather than a step of 1 multiplying by 10, it's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10 so that kind of makes the math of it a little bit screwy but the idea is the same, that if you're listening to a sound that's 50 decibels versus 60 decibels it's a lot quieter in terms of the energy being transmitted and going from, what would it be, 60 to 70 or 70 to 80 those steps, from 60 up to 80, that involves multiplying the amount of energy per square area by a factor of 100 so every time you see a logarithmic scale, know in your mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount this is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus outbreak so how might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the Richter scale number by 1, you're multiplying by 32 well, we could think in terms of a log with base 32 I could say if I take the log of, I'm just going to call r, the number for the Richter scale I might think of this as log base 32 and that's going to correspond to, no no no, I'm doing this wrong that's not the thing that's logged we take the log base 32 of the big number, of the TMT number, something that was like 1 megaton it's 1 million tons the log base 32, that should correspond to the Richter scale number but there might be some kind of offset, so we might say that there's some kind of constant s that we're adding to this Richter scale number and this expression is exactly the same, excuse me for going off the bottom there this expression is exactly the same as saying 32 to the power of some offset times our Richter scale number which is the same as taking 32 to that offset, which itself is just some big constant, times 32 to the Richter scale number so you might think of this as just being some constant times 32 to the power of the number you see so this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it that if this is what corresponds to the TMT amount that you see, as you increase that r step by step you're multiplying by 32 but another way of communicating the exact same fact is to take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is alright now the next thing I want to talk about is how we don't always have to worry about how to compute logs of different bases it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32, I referenced earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e computer scientists really like to have a log with base 2 and it turns out for computational purposes or for also thinking about how these things grow if you have one log, if you're able to compute one type of log, whether that's base 10, base 2, base e you can compute pretty much anything else that you want now to get our intuitions in that direction, let's turn back to our quiz and go to the next question and I believe that this question is the most, I don't know, this is a halfway reasonable question, this should be nice this is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2 context to base 10 context and it's also a good intuition for understanding powers of 2 to have in general the relationship that it has with powers of 10 because it's this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that these two sort of well you'll see what I mean, they play nicely with each other so our question asks, given the fact that 2 to the 10th is 1024, 1024, which is approximately 1000 so if you're being a little bit loose with
