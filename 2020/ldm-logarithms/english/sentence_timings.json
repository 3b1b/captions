  "you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you it ends up looking like this, you know, classic exponential curve that curves upward and I can sometimes make it hard to see where it's going or what the overall pattern is so a common trick is to say instead of looking at this y axis that increases linearly as in here I'm going from 5k to 10k, 10k to 15k, 15k to 20k each step is additive, we're adding 5000 instead use a y axis where each step is multiplicative so you're going from 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10, 10,000 all of these are increases by multiplying by 10 and what you can say is the y axis is now plotting not the total number of cases but the logarithm of the total number of cases and this actually makes it kind of easier to see on a plot if you wanted to project out what that trend would do and, you know, it's a little bit of a naive model to say oh it's going to grow exactly exponentially but in the early phases of something like this that is what it is so I kind of fast forward in the animation I made for that video and what's interesting is if back then I think I posted it on March 6th if you just found a line of best fit and you stretched it out and you said when is that line going to cross a million which because the y axis is growing with multiplicative steps each time that you step up you're multiplying by 10 so even if it might seem like the 20,000 cases or so that it was back then is very far from a million you know when you understand logarithmic scales it actually didn't seem that far it was only 30 days away if you naively just drew out that line and in fact fast forward to around April 5th which is when that would have predicted we hit a million cases outside China that's pretty much the day that it happened I think plus or minus a day but I don't remember exactly but it was right in that neighborhood because I remember thinking wow it was kind of a naive model for the video to even use and it's shocking that it matched so exactly thankfully since then the growth has stopped being exponential so if you look at it on a logarithmic plot instead of going up in a straight line it starts to taper off but point being any time that you're coming across something in nature or even in a man-made construct where what's natural to think about are multiplicative increases logarithms come in to help you so let's go ahead and think about what these actually are how are they defined and actually there was a question asked on Twitter right before we started that I think hits this very perfectly so Max 182 asks us additions inverse is subtraction multiplications inverse is division but I never truly understood if exponentiations inverse was nth rooting or logarithms if either one could be you know if either one could really be called that way can they that is such a fantastic question Max and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication you're not I'll just draw it out for you actually this is going to be easiest if we have some kind of exponential relationship let's say 10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000 there's three different numbers at play here we're showing a relationship between the 10, the 3 and the 1000 and aside from writing it with an exponent there's two other ways we could write that same relationship we could also say that the cube root of 1000 is equal to 10 this is asking 1000 what number raised to the third is equal to 1000 that's sort of what the cube root is asking and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3 okay three different notations the same exact relationship a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship between the three numbers with a triangle where you'd have our 10 sitting down here the power sitting at the top 10 to the third and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right and whenever you want to talk about a function or an operation between two of these numbers you indicate which one of them you're leaving out so to write 10 cubed we would include the 10 on the lower left the 3 on the upper right and then we leave out that bottom one so this is indicating that we're taking a power 10 cubed for that radical what you would say is we know what's on the bottom right something to some power equals 1000 we even know what the power is something cubed equals that 1000 but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation where if the thing you don't know instead of being on that bottom right is on the bottom left but what logarithms are it's an inverse in another sense because what it's saying is in this triangle relationship we know the base, it's 10 we know the power that it should be 1000 but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent so to answer your question maybe even more briefly we could say that 10 to the x the inverse of that the inverse is the log base 10 you know, of y of some other variable whereas if you're taking x to the 10th some unknown raised to a power the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value and on the triangle it's basically asking which of the things do we consider to be a variable so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity are you considering that top to be a variable quantity and what is the unknown but I really liked this idea of making explicit how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers one of them we introduce a new symbol this radical and one of them we introduce a new word, log so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation and while I don't necessarily think that oh we should teach logarithms with this triangle because convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression what I do like about it and starting off with it is when you see and think about this triangle it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that exponent every time that you see log of some value you should think in your mind okay whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent it wants to be an exponent and we'll see more of what that means as we go on okay so every time you see a log it wants to be an exponent this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is now in terms of convention for the first part of this video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it to be the shorthand for log base 10 because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there you should know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e there's also another notation for that ln for natural log we're going to talk all about the natural log next time so don't worry too much about that right now and there's also yet another convention often if you're in a computer science setting log without any added sugar to indicate what it is defaults to meaning log base 2 so this can sometimes be a source of confusion but it basically depends on what discipline you're in in math, not moth, math people really like a base of e we'll see why next lecture in, I don't know, I'll say engineering but really it's anything where you want good intuition with our normal base 10 number system log means log base 10 and if you're curious often in computer science settings log base 2 comes up all the time so like I said, in the back of your mind if you're trying to think of some of these properties just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number that can get you a really far way so we're going to start going through a couple of these properties and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples so we'll transition away from the poll and this time to the first proper question and the question asks you which of the following is true a.",

  "none of the above and remember like I said earlier we should fully expect that all of those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well they're going to be answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly but if you're someone who doesn't, don't let that intimidate you when you're looking at a problem like this one what I would encourage you to do is just plug in various powers of 10 and think in terms of the idea that the log function counts the number of zeros so I'll give you a little moment to think about that great ok so I'll go ahead and grade it and as always if that's faster than what you're comfortable with know that it's only because I want to proceed forward with the lesson so in this case the correct answer comes out to be log of 1000 times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x and now let's think about that for a moment and like I said when you're just getting started with them I think the best thing to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers and the best numbers to plug in are the ones that are already powers of 10 so if you're asking something like log of 1000 times x well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x log of 1000 times 100 ok, well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here well 1000 times 100 is 100,000 we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10 we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000 the 2 zeros from that 100 and we're putting them next to each other so it should be 5 total zeros but if you really reflect not just on how did the number turn out but why did it turn out that way it was the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100 which we could also write by saying the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100 so this idea that a logarithm of the product of two things is the sum of the logarithms of those two things in the context of powers of 10 that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive idea for a lot of us if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them you just take all of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other so the way I've written things out here is actually indicative of a slightly more general fact which is going to be our very first property of logarithms which is that if we take the log of A times B it equals the log of A plus the log of B now anytime you see one of these logarithm rules if you find yourself squinting your eyes or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it just plug in examples I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot but it's because I think it's very easy to forget once you're swamped in the algebra itself and you're sitting on some kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols to remind yourself you are okay to just plug in some numbers that's a fine thing to do and often it's a great way to yield intuition so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart we could just think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000 which is 5, there's 5 zeros in it and it breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part great, wonderful so carrying that intuition further, let's try another practice problem and again, if you know it, great, you'll be able to answer it fine but maybe think, not just what is the answer but how would I explain this answer to someone or how would I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own without me having to tell them what the answer is so there's two potential audience members there's those who are interested in the lesson itself and then those who are interested in the meta lesson so our question asks, again, which of the following is true A, log of x to the n is equal to n times log of x B, log of x to the n is equal to log of x to the power n C, log of x to the n is equal to n plus log of x or D, log of x to the n is equal to log of n times log of x or none of the above so again, take a moment to answer as people do answer, we'll start to see them roll in and if you are struggling to think of where to even start just plug in some powers of 10 and see what intuition you might get from it you alright, so it looks like just about everybody is landing on one particular answer hopefully it's the right answer, like I said, all to be expected so let's go ahead and see if our majority ended up correct and they did so the correct answer here is A, which it looks like 4000 of you got congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x so again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself I think a fine place to start is plugging something in and in this case, for log of x to the power n let's just try it with 100 to the power 3 and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way sometimes one example will do because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking well, that's 3 copies of 100 I'm taking 3 copies of 100 and when I multiply all that out and I think of log as counting the number of zeros we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100 I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together to get a million so this number is going to be 6 but if we think actually why was it 6 not just that's the number of zeros inside the million where that 6 came from is that we had 3 copies of that 100 and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros so that way it's a more general way you can think about it where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking at 1000 cubed or 1000 to the n or x to the power n you can think that it's whatever that value of n was the number of copies we were multiplying in times the number of, well let's see, it's not x times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted for x which in this case was 100 so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 to the power n this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000 counting the number of zeros in each one of them which is 4 so it would be n times 4 and of course the general property that most of you correctly answered is that you have this lovely little effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power that little power hops down in front of it and you just have log of what was on the inside now one of the maybe most important implications of that I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition if I'm taking log, and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10 of 10 to the power n we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10 which is of course 1 this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at the end or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10 and the answer is simply 1 which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n oh well the answer is n now with every given logarithm property that we have so in this case we just found one, log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves a little bit of intuition for these so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here try to hide where we're going what we just found, raising something to the n that hops in front this corresponds to the exponential property that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms which is they kind of, they're like exponentiation turned inside out and here's what I mean by that the thing sitting on the inside of the log, if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for something that's exponential in this case the a, the thing on the inside, corresponds to 10 to the x the output of the function whereas the entire thing itself, the log of a corresponds to what's on the inside over here just what's the exponent of the 10 so wherever you see a log expression here, you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side and every time you see an exponential the entire 10 to the x expression, the whole outer component on the right side that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs and we saw this above, right the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside, that's adding on the outside well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out that's telling us that multiplying on the outside, multiplying the outputs of the function is the same as adding on the inside because each of these logs, like log a and log b is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right okay, so with that, let's keep playing let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for so this last one, very nice, thinking of exponents hopping down the next one is something that might look a little bit weird to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it and we'll give it a little bit more, a moment to pull up which of the following is true?",

  "log base a of b is negative log base b of a log base a of b is 1 divided by log base b of a log base a of b is 1 minus log base b of a log base b of a is log base a of 1 divided by b or none of the above so it's asking what happens when we swap the base with what's sitting inside of the logarithm and I'll just give you a minute or two to answer that so let's do a couple more okay, so it seems like answers have kind of stabilized out there so let's go ahead and grade things and in this case, the correct answer of the choices we have comes out to be b that the log base a of b involves taking 1 divided by the log base b of a again, let's think this through both in terms of an example and then in terms of a more proofy, systematic reason why it should be true so if we're swapping our bases let's just start off with our good old friend log base 10 and let's plug in a nice power of 10 like 1000 counting the number of zeros, we get 3 so let's try swapping the bases and see what this should mean log base 1000 of 10 okay, well what is this asking?",

 [
  "well, if 10 cubed is 1000 that is the same thing as saying 10 is equal to 1000 raised to the 1 third doing the inverse here involves the multiplicative inverse of the exponent and the way that pans out is that it looks like 1 divided by 3 and that 3 corresponds to the log base 10 of 1000 it's 1 divided by the log base 10 of 1000 so more generally, you might guess based on this single example that when we swap the base with what's on the inside it corresponds to taking 1 divided by what's on the outside there and again, you can think this through in terms of looking at the corresponding exponential rule now what happened to my lovely little log and exponentials?",

  "wonderful so, again let's hide where some of the things some of the other properties that we'll get to here and I'll keep it in the same order I had it before here I was thinking that having it pre-written could keep me a little bit cleaner than usual but maybe it just involves playing this weird game of paper cutting shuffling around so what we just found, log base b of a if you swap those, it's the same as dividing by 1 what this corresponds to, off an exponential land is if you take b to some power and say that that equals a that's the same statement as saying that a to the inverse of that power equals b again, it's kind of helpful to take a moment and think of the logarithms as turning things inside out the expression log base b of a is playing the role of that x and the expression log base a of b is playing the role of whatever sits on top of the a and then symmetrically, the whole expression b to the power x is playing the role of the inside on the left, it plays the role of the a and the whole expression, a to the power of something plays the role of what's sitting inside the log base a there so you can see just by plugging in some examples and by corresponding it to the exponential rules we can already think through three different logarithm rules which if they were just handed down as pieces of algebra to be memorized you know, you could memorize them but it's very easy for them to kind of slip out of your head and it's also very easy to get frustrated by the task at hand but you might want to remind yourself that the reason we care about these sorts of things is understanding the rules of logarithms helps us do math in contexts where it's like a virus growing where from one day to the next, from one step to the next, things tend to grow multiplicatively understanding the rules of logarithms helps you to get a better feel for that kind of stuff so before we do a nice real world example of what that can look like let me just do one more quiz question in this vein to ask about properties of logarithms one last one before we transition to a little bit of a real world example get rid of what we had here and now, which of the following is true?",
