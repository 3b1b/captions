00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,840
...

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,640
you

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,420
you

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,960
you

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
you

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,240
you

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,620
you

8
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:14,740
you

9
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:43,480
you

10
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
you

11
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,140
you

12
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,860
you

13
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,060
you

14
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,180
you

15
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,720
you

16
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,200
you

17
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,280
you

18
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,240
you

19
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,660
you

20
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,140
you

21
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:29,980
you

22
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,440
you

23
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
you

24
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,420
you

25
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,880
you

26
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,840
you

27
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,220
it ends up looking like this, you know, classic exponential curve that curves upward

28
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,600
and I can sometimes make it hard to see where it's going or what the overall pattern is

29
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,560
so a common trick is to say instead of looking at this y axis that increases linearly

30
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,100
as in here I'm going from 5k to 10k, 10k to 15k, 15k to 20k

31
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,880
each step is additive, we're adding 5000

32
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,880
instead use a y axis where each step is multiplicative

33
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,780
so you're going from 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10, 10,000

34
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,440
all of these are increases by multiplying by 10

35
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,020
and what you can say is the y axis is now plotting not the total number of cases but the logarithm of the total number of cases

36
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,420
and this actually makes it kind of easier to see on a plot if you wanted to project out what that trend would do

37
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,600
and, you know, it's a little bit of a naive model to say oh it's going to grow exactly exponentially

38
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,800
but in the early phases of something like this that is what it is

39
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,100
so I kind of fast forward in the animation I made for that video

40
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,360
and what's interesting is if back then I think I posted it on March 6th

41
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,640
if you just found a line of best fit and you stretched it out

42
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,540
and you said when is that line going to cross a million

43
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,740
which because the y axis is growing with multiplicative steps

44
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,040
each time that you step up you're multiplying by 10

45
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,780
so even if it might seem like the 20,000 cases or so that it was back then is very far from a million

46
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,960
you know when you understand logarithmic scales it actually didn't seem that far

47
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,200
it was only 30 days away if you naively just drew out that line

48
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,840
and in fact fast forward to around April 5th which is when that would have predicted

49
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,060
we hit a million cases outside China

50
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,320
that's pretty much the day that it happened

51
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,440
I think plus or minus a day but I don't remember exactly

52
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,060
but it was right in that neighborhood because I remember thinking wow

53
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,140
it was kind of a naive model for the video to even use

54
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,800
and it's shocking that it matched so exactly

55
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,760
thankfully since then the growth has stopped being exponential

56
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,440
so if you look at it on a logarithmic plot instead of going up in a straight line it starts to taper off

57
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,200
but point being any time that you're coming across something in nature

58
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,900
or even in a man-made construct

59
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,620
where what's natural to think about are multiplicative increases

60
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,140
logarithms come in to help you

61
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,280
so let's go ahead and think about what these actually are

62
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,020
how are they defined

63
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,840
and actually there was a question asked on Twitter right before we started

64
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,980
that I think hits this very perfectly

65
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,100
so Max 182 asks us

66
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,020
additions inverse is subtraction

67
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,120
multiplications inverse is division

68
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,220
but I never truly understood if exponentiations inverse was nth rooting or logarithms

69
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,000
if either one could be

70
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,620
you know

71
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,620
if either one could really be called that way

72
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,400
can they

73
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,420
that is such a fantastic question Max

74
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,840
and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication

75
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,640
you're not

76
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,680
I'll just draw it out for you actually

77
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
this is going to be easiest

78
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,740
if we have some kind of exponential relationship

79
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,660
let's say

80
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,160
10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000

81
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,620
there's three different numbers at play here

82
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,520
we're showing a relationship between the 10, the 3 and the 1000

83
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,080
and aside from writing it with an exponent

84
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,420
there's two other ways we could write that same relationship

85
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,900
we could also say

86
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,180
that the cube root of 1000

87
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,220
is equal to 10

88
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,740
this is asking

89
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,980
1000

90
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,460
what number raised to the third is equal to 1000

91
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,200
that's sort of what the cube root is asking

92
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing

93
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,880
is to say the log base 10

94
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
of 1000

95
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,760
is equal to 3

96
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,900
okay

97
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,720
three different notations the same exact relationship

98
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,680
a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation

99
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,400
that would center in the idea that

100
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,820
you think of this relationship between the three numbers with a triangle

101
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,480
where you'd have our 10 sitting down here

102
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,000
the power sitting at the top 10 to the third

103
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,920
and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right

104
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,840
and whenever you want to talk about a function

105
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,940
or an operation between two of these numbers

106
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,720
you indicate which one of them you're leaving out

107
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,500
so to write 10 cubed

108
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,080
we would include the 10 on the lower left

109
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
the 3 on the upper right

110
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,500
and then we leave out that bottom one

111
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,880
so this is indicating that we're taking a power 10 cubed

112
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,900
for that radical

113
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,380
what you would say is

114
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,160
we know what's on the bottom right

115
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,300
something to some power equals 1000

116
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,860
we even know what the power is

117
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,140
something cubed equals that 1000

118
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,340
but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left

119
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,600
that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation

120
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,720
where if the thing you don't know

121
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,400
instead of being on that bottom right

122
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,540
is on the bottom left

123
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,920
but what logarithms are

124
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,800
it's an inverse in another sense

125
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,560
because what it's saying is

126
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,320
in this triangle relationship

127
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,860
we know the base, it's 10

128
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,620
we know the power that it should be

129
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,620
1000

130
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,680
but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent

131
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,480
so to answer your question maybe even more briefly

132
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,260
we could say that 10 to the x

133
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,020
the inverse of that

134
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,540
the inverse is the log base 10

135
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,000
you know, of y

136
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,420
of some other variable

137
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,420
whereas if you're taking x to the 10th

138
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,680
some unknown raised to a power

139
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,900
the inverse of that

140
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,500
is going to be the 10th root

141
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,800
of some other value

142
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,260
and on the triangle it's basically asking

143
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,660
which of the things do we consider to be a variable

144
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,460
so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity

145
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,580
are you considering that top to be a variable quantity

146
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,320
and what is the unknown

147
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,160
but I really liked this idea of

148
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,220
making explicit how we have three totally different notations

149
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,400
for the same exact fact

150
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,840
one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers

151
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,300
one of them we introduce a new symbol

152
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,060
this radical

153
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,080
and one of them we introduce a new word, log

154
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,900
so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong

155
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,020
and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation

156
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,280
and while I don't necessarily think that

157
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,860
oh we should teach logarithms with this triangle

158
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,680
because convention is what it is

159
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,560
so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression

160
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,260
what I do like about it and starting off with it

161
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
is when you see and think about this triangle

162
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,240
it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be

163
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,500
is that exponent

164
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,140
every time that you see log of some value

165
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,820
you should think in your mind

166
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,680
okay whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent

167
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,840
it wants to be an exponent

168
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,870
and we'll see more of what that means as we go on

169
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,900
okay so every time you see a log

170
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,760
it wants to be an exponent this value three

171
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,840
and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is

172
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,580
now in terms of convention

173
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,960
for the first part of this video

174
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,260
I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it

175
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,160
to be the shorthand for log base 10

176
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,340
because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there

177
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,760
you should know that often in math

178
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,400
the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e

179
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,760
there's also another notation for that ln for natural log

180
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,200
we're going to talk all about the natural log next time

181
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,380
so don't worry too much about that right now

182
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,580
and there's also yet another convention

183
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,900
often if you're in a computer science setting

184
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,540
log without any added sugar to indicate what it is

185
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,240
defaults to meaning log base 2

186
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,520
so this can sometimes be a source of confusion

187
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,340
but it basically depends on what discipline you're in

188
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,480
in math, not moth, math

189
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,540
people really like a base of e

190
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,860
we'll see why next lecture

191
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,160
in, I don't know, I'll say engineering

192
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,080
but really it's anything where you want

193
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,900
good intuition with our normal base 10 number system

194
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,600
log means log base 10

195
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,560
and if you're curious often in computer science settings

196
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,700
log base 2 comes up all the time

197
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,720
so

198
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,060
like I said, in the back of your mind

199
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,180
if you're trying to think of some of these properties

200
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,180
just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number

201
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,920
that can get you a really far way

202
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,060
so we're going to start going through a couple of these properties

203
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,020
and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples

204
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
so we'll transition away from the poll

205
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,980
and this time to the first proper question

206
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,100
and the question

207
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,100
asks you which of the following is true

208
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,780
a. the log of 1000 times x is equal to 3 times the log of x

209
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,540
and remember we're using the convention that it's base 10 log

210
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,360
b. log of 1000 times x equals log of x cubed

211
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,120
c. log of 1000 times x equals 3 plus the log of x

212
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,040
d. log of 1000 times x equals 3 to the power of log of x

213
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,180
and e. none of the above

214
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,580
and remember like I said earlier

215
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,520
we should fully expect that all of those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well

216
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,120
they're going to be answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly

217
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,120
but if you're someone who doesn't, don't let that intimidate you

218
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
when you're looking at a problem like this one

219
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,320
what I would encourage you to do is

220
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,100
just plug in various powers of 10

221
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,940
and think in terms of the idea

222
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,120
that the log function counts the number of zeros

223
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,140
so I'll give you a little moment to think about that

224
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,680
great

225
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,040
ok so I'll go ahead and grade it

226
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,560
and as always if that's faster than what you're comfortable with

227
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,940
know that it's only because I want to proceed forward with the lesson

228
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,260
so in this case the correct answer comes out to be

229
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,720
log of 1000 times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x

230
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,220
and now let's think about that for a moment

231
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,080
and like I said when you're just getting started with them

232
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,140
I think the best thing to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers

233
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,900
and the best numbers to plug in are the ones that are already powers of 10

234
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,080
so if you're asking something like log of 1000 times x

235
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,120
well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x

236
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,560
log of 1000 times 100

237
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,080
ok, well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here

238
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,900
well 1000 times 100 is 100,000

239
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,840
we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10

240
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,180
we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000

241
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,960
the 2 zeros from that 100 and we're putting them next to each other

242
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,040
so it should be 5 total zeros

243
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,920
but if you really reflect not just on how did the number turn out

244
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
but why did it turn out that way

245
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,860
it was the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100

246
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,180
which we could also write by saying

247
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,160
the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100

248
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,180
so this idea that a logarithm of the product of two things

249
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,000
is the sum of the logarithms of those two things

250
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,740
in the context of powers of 10

251
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,380
that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive idea for a lot of us

252
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,260
if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them

253
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,180
you just take all of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other

254
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,480
so the way I've written things out here is actually indicative of a slightly more general fact

255
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,460
which is going to be our very first property of logarithms

256
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,360
which is that if we take the log of A times B

257
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,500
it equals the log of A plus the log of B

258
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,860
now anytime you see one of these logarithm rules

259
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,720
if you find yourself squinting your eyes or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it

260
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,260
just plug in examples

261
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,080
I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot

262
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,300
but it's because I think it's very easy to forget

263
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,180
once you're swamped in the algebra itself

264
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,860
and you're sitting on some kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols

265
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,440
to remind yourself you are okay to just plug in some numbers

266
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,000
that's a fine thing to do

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,280
and often it's a great way to yield intuition

268
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,520
so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart

269
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,760
we could just think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000

270
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,260
which is 5, there's 5 zeros in it

271
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,800
and it breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part

272
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,340
great, wonderful

273
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,280
so carrying that intuition further, let's try another practice problem

274
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,560
and again, if you know it, great, you'll be able to answer it fine

275
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,000
but maybe think, not just what is the answer

276
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,260
but how would I explain this answer to someone

277
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,820
or how would I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own

278
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,720
without me having to tell them what the answer is

279
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,580
so there's two potential audience members

280
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,360
there's those who are interested in the lesson itself

281
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,740
and then those who are interested in the meta lesson

282
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,720
so our question asks, again, which of the following is true

283
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,300
A, log of x to the n is equal to n times log of x

284
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,620
B, log of x to the n is equal to log of x to the power n

285
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,760
C, log of x to the n is equal to n plus log of x

286
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,860
or D, log of x to the n is equal to log of n times log of x

287
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,600
or none of the above

288
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,880
so again, take a moment to answer

289
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,220
as people do answer, we'll start to see them roll in

290
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,380
and if you are struggling to think of where to even start

291
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,000
just plug in some powers of 10

292
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,320
and see what intuition you might get from it

293
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:04,060
you

294
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,200
alright, so it looks like just about everybody is landing on one particular answer

295
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
hopefully it's the right answer, like I said, all to be expected

296
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,020
so let's go ahead and see if our majority ended up correct

297
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,380
and they did

298
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,780
so the correct answer here is A, which it looks like 4000 of you got

299
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,340
congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x

300
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,540
so again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone

301
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,700
or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself

302
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,380
I think a fine place to start is plugging something in

303
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,980
and in this case, for log of x to the power n

304
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,800
let's just try it with 100 to the power 3

305
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,040
and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work

306
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,580
but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is

307
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,840
but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way

308
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,080
sometimes one example will do

309
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,680
because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking

310
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,900
well, that's 3 copies of 100

311
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm taking 3 copies of 100

312
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,040
and when I multiply all that out

313
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,820
and I think of log as counting the number of zeros

314
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,960
we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it

315
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,340
that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100

316
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,920
I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together

317
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,700
to get a million

318
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,020
so this number is going to be 6

319
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,880
but if we think actually why was it 6

320
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,240
not just that's the number of zeros inside the million

321
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,960
where that 6 came from

322
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,460
is that we had 3 copies of that 100

323
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,320
and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros

324
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,360
so that way it's a more general way you can think about it

325
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,600
where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking at 1000 cubed

326
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,700
or 1000 to the n or x to the power n

327
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,240
you can think that it's whatever that value of n was

328
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,220
the number of copies we were multiplying in

329
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,640
times the number of, well let's see, it's not x

330
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,360
times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted for x

331
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,700
which in this case was 100

332
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,780
so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 to the power n

333
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,700
this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000

334
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,340
counting the number of zeros in each one of them which is 4

335
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,100
so it would be n times 4

336
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
and of course the general property that most of you correctly answered

337
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,920
is that you have this lovely little effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power

338
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,700
that little power hops down in front of it

339
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,500
and you just have log of what was on the inside

340
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,220
now one of the maybe most important implications of that

341
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,180
I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition

342
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,920
if I'm taking log, and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10

343
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,560
of 10 to the power n

344
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,760
we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front

345
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,120
and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10

346
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,900
which is of course 1

347
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,720
this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at the end

348
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,420
or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10

349
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,720
and the answer is simply 1

350
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,800
which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression

351
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,100
is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n

352
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,740
oh well the answer is n

353
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,740
now with every given logarithm property that we have

354
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,700
so in this case we just found one, log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front

355
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,420
there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property

356
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,660
and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves a little bit of intuition for these

357
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,020
so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here

358
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,060
try to hide where we're going

359
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
what we just found, raising something to the n that hops in front

360
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,640
this corresponds to the exponential property that if I take 10 to the x

361
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,780
and raise that whole thing to the power n

362
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,200
that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x

363
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,260
and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms

364
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,440
which is they kind of, they're like exponentiation turned inside out

365
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,820
and here's what I mean by that

366
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,060
the thing sitting on the inside of the log, if I'm taking log of a

367
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,900
you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for something that's exponential

368
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,620
in this case the a, the thing on the inside, corresponds to 10 to the x

369
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,100
the output of the function

370
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,700
whereas the entire thing itself, the log of a

371
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,880
corresponds to what's on the inside over here

372
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,120
just what's the exponent of the 10

373
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,080
so wherever you see a log expression here, you should be thinking

374
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,580
that plays the role of an exponent on the right side

375
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,980
and every time you see an exponential

376
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,320
the entire 10 to the x expression, the whole outer component on the right side

377
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,660
that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs

378
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,220
and we saw this above, right

379
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,300
the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside, that's adding on the outside

380
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,160
well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out

381
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,600
that's telling us that multiplying on the outside, multiplying the outputs of the function

382
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,900
is the same as adding on the inside

383
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,840
because each of these logs, like log a and log b

384
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,720
is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right

385
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,920
okay, so with that, let's keep playing

386
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,360
let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for

387
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,200
so this last one, very nice, thinking of exponents hopping down

388
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,100
the next one is something that might look a little bit weird

389
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,300
to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms

390
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,640
but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it

391
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,720
and we'll give it a little bit more, a moment to pull up

392
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,560
which of the following is true?

393
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,560
log base a of b is negative log base b of a

394
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,700
log base a of b is 1 divided by log base b of a

395
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,760
log base a of b is 1 minus log base b of a

396
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,520
log base b of a is log base a of 1 divided by b

397
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,020
or none of the above

398
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,940
so it's asking what happens when we swap the base with what's sitting inside of the logarithm

399
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,700
and I'll just give you a minute or two to answer that

400
00:32:47,560 --> 00:33:17,540
so let's do a couple more

401
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,440
okay, so it seems like answers have kind of stabilized out there

402
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,760
so let's go ahead and grade things

403
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,480
and in this case, the correct answer of the choices we have comes out to be b

404
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,940
that the log base a of b involves taking 1 divided by the log base b of a

405
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,480
again, let's think this through both in terms of an example and then in terms of a more

406
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,240
proofy, systematic reason why it should be true

407
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
so if we're swapping our bases

408
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,860
let's just start off with

409
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,100
our good old friend log base 10

410
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,120
and let's plug in a nice power of 10 like 1000

411
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,360
counting the number of zeros, we get 3

412
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,560
so let's try swapping the bases and see what this should mean

413
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,200
log base 1000 of 10

414
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,600
okay, well what is this asking?

415
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,220
maybe you think of drawing the little triangle saying something like

416
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,580
we know 1000 to something is equal to 10

417
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,580
1000 to the what equals 10?

418
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,140
well, if 10 cubed is 1000

419
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,800
that is the same thing as saying 10 is equal to 1000

420
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,680
raised to the 1 third

421
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,540
doing the inverse here involves the multiplicative inverse of the exponent

422
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,420
and the way that pans out is that it looks like 1 divided by 3

423
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,920
and that 3 corresponds to the log base 10 of 1000

424
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:05,560
it's 1 divided by the log base 10 of 1000

425
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,780
so more generally, you might guess

426
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,120
based on this single example that when we swap the base with what's on the inside

427
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,620
it corresponds to taking 1 divided by what's on the outside there

428
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,620
and again, you can think this through in terms of

429
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,080
looking at the corresponding exponential rule

430
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,000
now what happened to my lovely little log and exponentials?

431
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:28,660
wonderful

432
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,820
so, again let's hide where some of the things

433
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,760
some of the other properties that we'll get to here

434
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,480
and I'll keep it in the same order I had it before

435
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,220
here I was thinking that having it pre-written could keep me a little bit cleaner than usual

436
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,940
but maybe it just involves playing this weird game of paper cutting shuffling around

437
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,200
so what we just found, log base b of a

438
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,360
if you swap those, it's the same as dividing by 1

439
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,920
what this corresponds to, off an exponential land

440
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,260
is if you take b to some power

441
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,580
and say that that equals a

442
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,760
that's the same statement as saying that a to the inverse of that power equals b

443
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,720
again, it's kind of helpful to take a moment and think of the logarithms as turning things inside out

444
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,700
the expression log base b of a is playing the role of that x

445
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:25,060
and the expression log base a of b is playing the role of whatever sits on top of the a

446
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,080
and then symmetrically, the whole expression b to the power x

447
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,900
is playing the role of the inside on the left, it plays the role of the a

448
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,100
and the whole expression, a to the power of something

449
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,640
plays the role of what's sitting inside the log base a there

450
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,920
so you can see just by plugging in some examples and by corresponding it to the exponential rules

451
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,360
we can already think through three different logarithm rules

452
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,120
which if they were just handed down as pieces of algebra to be memorized

453
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,260
you know, you could memorize them

454
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,640
but it's very easy for them to kind of slip out of your head

455
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,520
and it's also very easy to get frustrated by the task at hand

456
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,000
but you might want to remind yourself that the reason we care about these sorts of things

457
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,800
is understanding the rules of logarithms helps us do math in contexts where it's like a virus growing

458
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,960
where from one day to the next, from one step to the next, things tend to grow multiplicatively

459
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,300
understanding the rules of logarithms helps you to get a better feel for that kind of stuff

460
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,500
so before we do a nice real world example of what that can look like

461
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,220
let me just do one more quiz question in this vein to ask about properties of logarithms

462
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,540
one last one before we transition to a little bit of a real world example

463
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,500
get rid of what we had here

464
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,680
and now, which of the following is true?

465
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,880
log of a plus b is the same as log of a plus log of b

466
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,060
log of a plus b is equal to log of a times log of b

467
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,540
log of a plus b is equal to one divided by log of a plus log of b

468
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,660
or log of a plus b is equal to one divided by log of a times log of b

469
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,040
or none of the above

470
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,640
ah, and now we don't have as much consensus, do we?

471
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
very interesting, we've got a horse race between two

472
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,000
so I will give you a moment to think this through

473
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:53,720
Ally Freed

474
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,800
So, you know, I was just talking about how we might think in terms of

475
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,520
multiplicative growth and that doesn't just have to be powers of 10

476
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,200
We could also do something like powers of 3 or if you're going from 1 to 3 to 9

477
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,060
to 27 to 81 all of these

478
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,460
We could say that the log base 3 of these numbers

479
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,760
Just grows in nice little steps

480
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:25,260
So log base 3 of 1, 3 to the what equals 1, the answer is 0. In general the log of 1 no matter the base

481
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,380
will be 0. Log base 3 of 3, 3 to the what equals 3 is 1

482
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,560
Similarly log base 3 of 9 is 2

483
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,660
You might wonder what my question is, but it'll help to draw all of these out and

484
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,420
For my own pleasure here. Let me just write out one more log base 3 of 81 is 4. Now

485
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:51,060
I've heard that ostensibly if you ask a child's let's say around like 5 or 6 years old

486
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,960
What number is halfway between 1 and 9?

487
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay, you say what number is halfway?

488
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,120
Their instincts for how to answer are

489
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,380
Logarithmic whereas our instincts tend to be more linear

490
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:11,200
So we often think 1 and 9 you've got a bunch of evenly spaced numbers between them 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

491
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,180
And if you go right halfway in between you'll land on 5

492
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,880
But if you're thinking in terms of multiplicative growth where to get from 1 to 9

493
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
It's not a matter of adding a bunch of things

494
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,560
But you're growing by a certain amount you grow by a factor of 3 then you grow by another factor of 3

495
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,680
supposedly a kid's natural instinct lines up with saying 3 and supposedly this also lines up with

496
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,920
If you have anthropologists studying societies that haven't developed

497
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,720
Counting systems and writing in the same way that modern societies have they'll answer 3 for this

498
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,900
So my question for the audience if any of you watching right now have access to a small child

499
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,600
Let's say in the range of 5 years old

500
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,440
See if you can go ask them

501
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,020
What number is halfway between 1 and 9 and if you can let us know on Twitter what the

502
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,560
What the child says what their actual answer is?

503
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,100
Because I I don't know why I'm just a little bit skeptical of whether that

504
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,640
Actually pans out in practice. I understand

505
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,000
this is not a super scientific way to do it asking people watching a YouTube live stream to

506
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,460
Survey their own children and then tweet the answer but for my own sake it would be interesting to see some kind of validation there

507
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,260
Back to our question. This is the first one that doesn't seem to have a huge

508
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,820
Consensus in one direction, but let's go ahead and grade it to see what the answer turns out to be

509
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,560
Great okay, so

510
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:39,480
2400 of you correctly answered that it's none of the above okay that log of a plus B doesn't satisfy any of these nice properties

511
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,340
And in general unless we're going to be working with

512
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,320
Certain kinds of approximations especially when the natural log comes into play we might talk about this next time

513
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,780
Adding the inputs of a logarithm is actually a very weird sensation

514
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,720
It's a very weird thing to do and to get a sense of that weirdness plug in some powers of 10

515
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,180
If I ask you log of a plus B

516
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,980
What you might start thinking is okay? Let me just plug in some examples like

517
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,460
10,000 and

518
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,220
100 and

519
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:18,660
I asked myself if I do this zero counting function of what's in that input how many zeros are in it?

520
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,600
But it's weird because when we add 10,100 well, we're no longer at a clean power of 10 and okay

521
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,340
That's fine. You know often you're taking logarithms of things that aren't clean powers of 10

522
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,060
but it becomes very strange to ask how you express this in terms of

523
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,440
log of 100 which was 2 and

524
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,740
log of

525
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,500
10,000

526
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,620
Which was 4?

527
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:53,060
Because if you look at log of 10,100 it's asking 10 to the what is equal to 10,100

528
00:42:53,060 --> 00:43:00,000
You might say it's gonna be a little above 4 because it's kind of close to 10,000 so the best you might

529
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,380
Guess here is oh, this is gonna be something. That's kind of like

530
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:10,180
The log of 10,000, but that just feels like a coincidence based on the two numbers that we happen to put in

531
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,320
There's not a nice systematic reason coming there, so maybe you guess oh if the numbers A and B are very different

532
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,620
It's kind of close to

533
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,640
Whatever the maximum of them is

534
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,620
But it's very bizarre and most importantly for the sake of the quiz

535
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,720
If you just look at the options that it's giving you if you try this out with any particular numbers

536
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,620
You'll find that none of those actually work

537
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,980
So all is good sometimes you get something that looks like it's going to be a nice property

538
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,520
But it doesn't end up being a nice property, and I also think that's important rather than just finding yourself

539
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,920
Only working with the various

540
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,500
You know log of A times B or log of X to the power N these things that have a nice rule

541
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,760
Sometimes you're out in the mathematical wild you're working on some problem

542
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,180
You have a logarithm expression

543
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,420
And it's adding things in the input and you want to be able to

544
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,300
Have familiarity with the fact that that's kind of weird that you're not going to be able to simplify

545
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,280
But if you you know if you hadn't thought about that before you might wonder

546
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,380
Oh is there just some formula that I haven't seen before

547
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,580
So with all of that let me go ahead and take a couple questions from the audience

548
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,740
Before we transition to a different sort of example

549
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,240
So it looks like Uma Sherma asks

550
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,980
Can can the base be zero? That's an interesting question okay? Can the base of a logarithm be zero?

551
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,720
Well in terms of our triangle we might think of that as saying

552
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,880
You know zero to some kind of power X is equal to some other value Y

553
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,980
Right this is something that we could write either by saying zero to the X equals Y

554
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,560
Or we could write the same thing by saying log base zero of Y

555
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,240
Is equal to X zero to the what equals X?

556
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,940
Now the issue here is that zero to anything ends up being zero right so?

557
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,880
If we're just going to be thinking of log

558
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,940
base zero of

559
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:07,440
Y for any other input Y. You know you want to input something like one or two or pi

560
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:16,140
Anything you might want you're asking the question zero to the what is equal to one or two or pi?

561
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,360
Or whatever number you might have there, and there's just not going to be an answer so at best

562
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,420
You could try to say oh yes log of zero. It's a perfectly valid function

563
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:31,020
It's only defined on the input zero, but even then you'd have trouble

564
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,900
Trying to finagle what you want there because saying zero to the what equals zero. It's like anything anything applies to it

565
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,540
So your arm is going to be twisted behind your back

566
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:46,080
However you want to make that work and it corresponds to the fact that the exponential function with base zero

567
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:54,240
Is entirely zero it doesn't it doesn't map numbers in a nice one-to-one fashion on to each other?

568
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:00,560
So that's a great question can you have a log base zero now back to the idea of where these things come up in the

569
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,060
real world

570
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,260
One one example I kind of like is the Richter scale for earthquakes

571
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,900
so the Richter scale

572
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,020
Gives us a quantification for how strong an earthquake is okay?

573
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:19,260
And it can be anything from very small numbers up to very large numbers like I think the largest earthquake ever measured

574
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,080
And this is just a chart that comes from Wikipedia was a nine point five okay?

575
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,380
And to appreciate just how insane that is it's worth

576
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,920
looking at the relationship between

577
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,180
What these numbers mean and then something like the equivalent amount of TNT some sort of measure of how much energy there is in it

578
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,680
And then what we can try to do here is see if we can get an expression for

579
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,520
the Richter scale number in terms of the amount of energy and

580
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,140
Why logarithms would be a natural way to describe this?

581
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,060
So the key to focus on is as we're taking steps forward how much do things increase?

582
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,960
So for example if we go from two

583
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,740
Well in this case it doesn't show us where three is so maybe we think of

584
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,920
Taking a step from two up to four which is kind of like taking two steps

585
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,060
What does that do in terms of the amount of energy?

586
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,680
Well it looks like it takes us from one metric ton of TNT

587
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,220
Which is I guess a large bomb from World War two and it takes us up to a kiloton a thousand times as much

588
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,680
Okay

589
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,660
Which is a small a small atom bomb so just two steps on the Richter scale

590
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:27,960
Going from an earthquake of magnitude two to an earthquake of magnitude four takes us from large bomb from World War two

591
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,340
Up to the nuclear age, right?

592
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,240
so that is

593
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,120
noteworthy and

594
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,930
The first clean step that we get is going from four to five at least in terms of what this chart is nicely showing us

595
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,100
And evidently a single step up from four to five

596
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,220
Corresponds to going from one kiloton to 32 kilotons

597
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,940
And that was evidently the size of the city destroying bomb that land on Nagasaki

598
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,620
So this is maybe one thing that can be counterintuitive about logarithmic scales if you're just hearing in the news the difference between oh there

599
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:05,480
Was an earthquake that was a 4.0 versus an earthquake that was a 5.0. It's easy to think yeah four and five

600
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,920
Those are pretty similar numbers

601
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,320
But evidently in terms of TNT amounts that corresponds to multiplying by 32 to get from one to the next

602
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,380
And going from two to four was evidently multiplying by about a thousand

603
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,530
okay, and the only reason that's bigger is because here our chart wasn't showing what three was so we were taking two steps and

604
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,820
You can verify for yourself that if you take a step of 32, and then you multiply by another 32

605
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,380
That's actually pretty close to a thousand

606
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:40,340
So the idea that additive steps on the Richter number correspond to multiplicative steps in the TNT

607
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:47,000
Seems to suggest that something logarithmic is at play here, and it's a little interesting to just keep going here and say

608
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,340
How how much does this grow partly?

609
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:57,040
Because of the the world phenomena. It's describing. Yes, not a huge surprise that as we take another step

610
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,080
It's multiplying by about 32 again

611
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:07,240
But raining that in to our intuitions. That's the difference between 32 kilotons a small atom bomb

612
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:13,560
And then one megaton which we might think of as not small atom bomb Nagasaki atom bomb

613
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,140
Which I guess is 32 of the Nagasaki atom bombs

614
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:24,020
For one megaton that is evidently the magnitude of the double string flat earthquake in Nevada, USA 1994

615
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:29,130
I didn't know what that was. Thanks Wikipedia in terms of frequencies by the way I

616
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,580
Also looked these up evidently ones that are less than two those happen all the time

617
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:40,880
There's like 8,000 of those per day, but as soon as we're in the realm of atom bombs things like 3.5 and 4

618
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,780
Those evidently also happen quite frequently somewhere on the earth. There's around 134 of those happening somewhere every day who knew

619
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:55,740
But as we get even more intense into this 5 and 6 range which you know we're well above the atom bomb scale

620
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,660
now we're only merely at around 2 per day and

621
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,440
You know I'm sure that a geologist could come in and explain why we all shouldn't be super worried about the fact that there's

622
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,880
two atom bomb equivalent

623
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:13,880
Disruptions to the Earth's crust happening every day, but presumably it's particularly rare for those to be concentrated on some

624
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,900
Some spot like a city where what lots of people live

625
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,560
Now just verifying that I thought that each step involves a growth of 32

626
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,860
Let's look at what the step from 6 up to 7 looks like and here

627
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,840
It's giving us lots more examples in between maybe giving the illusion that that's a bigger step than it actually is and indeed

628
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,260
That's the difference between 1 megaton and 32 megatons, so that's multiplying by 32

629
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,980
One of the things I found most interesting on this chart by the way was

630
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:48,510
Look at how far we have to go before we get to the largest nuclear weapon that's ever actually been

631
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:50,710
Tested

632
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,150
This was height of the Cold War the Tsar bomb

633
00:50:54,150 --> 00:51:01,970
That was 50 megatons, and I believe they actually had original plans to have a 100 megaton bomb but talked themselves down from that

634
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:07,350
50 megatons we're talking start off at that 32 kilotons of the Nagasaki bomb

635
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,290
Multiply by 32 to get a megaton multiply by another 32

636
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:16,570
Right so we're talking about a thousand times the strength of the World War two ending explosion

637
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,030
And you're still not at the 50 megatons of what humanity is capable of

638
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,670
And that is evidently you know the Java earthquake of Indonesia

639
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:29,330
so 7.0 is not just a little bit bigger than 6.0. It's a lot bigger and

640
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,110
The point here of course is just that when you have a scale giving you multiplicative increases

641
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,530
It's worth appreciating that what look like small steps

642
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:42,850
Can actually be huge steps in terms of the energy implied or the absolute values implied here

643
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,750
So it I mean when we're thinking about the fact that there was ever a 9.5

644
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:53,610
That actually seems absurd given that it's only in the 7.0 range that we're talking about the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out

645
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,830
And this is indicative of one area where logarithms tend to come about it's

646
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:05,450
When humans want to create a scale for something that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be

647
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,770
So in the case of size of earthquakes you can have things from what happens

648
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,990
Just all the time around the earth the size of a large hand grenade

649
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:19,430
And you want that to be on your scale and something to think about ranging all the way up to you know the largest disruption

650
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:21,450
that we've

651
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,190
Seen in human history right and in order to have that in a way that you're not just

652
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:31,070
Writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case and a whole bunch of different a smaller number of digits

653
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,770
For your number in another case

654
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,610
It's nice to take logarithms

655
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:39,890
And then just put that on a single scale that basically puts squishes those numbers between 0 and 10

656
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,390
You see something very similar going on with the decibel scale for music that one actually

657
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:52,010
Works a little bit differently where every time you take a step up of 10 decibels that corresponds to multi multiplying by 10

658
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,730
So rather than a step of 1 multiplying by 10

659
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:59,110
It's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10 so that kind of makes the math of it a little bit screwy

660
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:04,750
But the idea is the same that if you're listening to a sound that's 50 decibels for 60 decibels

661
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:09,410
It's a lot quieter in terms of the energy being transmitted and going from you know

662
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,790
What would it be 60 to 70 or 70 to 80?

663
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:18,250
Those steps you know from 60 up to 80 that involves multiplying the amount of energy per square area

664
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:22,170
By a factor of 100 so every time you see a logarithmic scale

665
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:27,350
Know in your mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount

666
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:33,030
This is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus outbreak so

667
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:40,690
How might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the Richter scale number by 1 you're multiplying by 32

668
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:48,690
Well, we could think in terms of a log with base 32. I

669
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,450
Could say if I take the log of

670
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:57,690
I'm just gonna call our the number for the Richter scale. I might think of this as log base 32 and

671
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,190
That's going to correspond to

672
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,030
No, no, no, I'm doing this wrong

673
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,870
That's not the thing that's logged

674
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:11,490
We take the log base 32 of the big number of the the TNT number something that was like

675
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,650
You know one

676
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,810
Gigaton or one megaton

677
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,090
It's one million

678
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:19,830
Tons

679
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,710
The log base 32 that should correspond to the Richter scale number

680
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:30,290
But there might be some kind of offset. So we might say that there's some kind of

681
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:36,810
Constant s that we're adding to this Richter scale number and this expression is exactly the same

682
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,930
Excuse me for going off the bottom there. This expression is exactly the same as saying

683
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:50,950
32 to the power of some offset times our Richter scale number, which is the same as taking you know

684
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:57,210
32 to that offset which itself is just some big constant times

685
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,810
32 to the Richter scale number so you might think of this as just being some constant

686
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,650
Times 32 to the power of the number you see

687
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:11,850
So this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it

688
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,390
that if this is what corresponds to the TNT amount that you see as

689
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,190
You increase that R step by step you're multiplying by 32

690
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:26,590
But another way of communicating the exact same fact is to take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is

691
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:31,610
Alright now the next thing I want to talk about is how we don't always have to

692
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:37,870
Worry about how to compute logs of different bases and it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32

693
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:42,450
I referenced earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e

694
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:48,050
computer scientists really like to have a log with base 2 and it turns out for

695
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:52,990
Computational purposes or for also thinking about how these things grow if you have one

696
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:59,110
Log if you're able to compute one type of log whether that's base 10 base 2 base e you can compute pretty much anything else

697
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,070
That you want

698
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:00,690
Okay

699
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:05,870
now to get our intuitions in that direction, let's turn back to our quiz and

700
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,730
go to the next question and

701
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:15,450
I believe that this question is the most I don't know. This is this is a halfway reasonable question. This should be nice

702
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,250
This is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2

703
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,590
contexts to base 10 contexts and it's also a good intuition for

704
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,530
understanding powers of 2 to have in general

705
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:34,490
The relationship that it has with powers of 10 because it's this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that

706
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,850
these two sort of

707
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,170
Well, you'll see what I mean. They play nicely with each other

708
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:46,210
So a question asks given the fact that 2 to the 10th is 10 24 a thousand and 24 which is approximately

709
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:52,290
1000 okay, so you can if you're being a little bit loose with your numbers and you're just making approximations 2 to the 10th

710
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:56,170
Basically a thousand which of the following is closest to being true

711
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:00,130
Log base 2 of 10 is approximately 0.3

712
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:06,130
Log base 2 of 10 is approximately sorry log base 10 of 2 is approximately 0.3

713
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:12,850
Log base 2 of 10 is approximately 1 third or log base 10 of 2 is approximately 1 third

714
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:18,130
Hey, which of these is closest to being true based on the fact that 2 to the 10th is essentially a thousand

715
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,850
I'll give you a little moment for that

716
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:46,750
You

717
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,550
Interesting that we've got kind of a split on this one so

718
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:58,910
I'm wondering if they're gonna be numerically pretty similar or if they're gonna be conceptually similar

719
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,690
Or if there's even a difference between those two

720
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:09,290
So since answers keep rolling in I'm gonna give this give this a little bit more time so anyone at home watching

721
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:12,990
Hopefully you already have a pencil and paper out to be noodling through these yourself

722
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,130
That is the spirit of the lectures that we're doing

723
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,110
If you don't now is the time to take out a pencil and paper and

724
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:24,170
See if you can think this one through and write it out some of the problems that we're gonna build to here

725
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:29,750
Definitely will require pencil and paper so now is as good a time as any and if you're watching this in the future even if

726
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,490
You can't participate in the live poll. I really do think it's a lot of fun to

727
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:37,890
Kind of throw your own hat into the mix even if it's not going to contribute to one of the numbers

728
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,090
That you see growing on the screen

729
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:47,050
I'll give you a little bit more time here as the answers seem to continue rolling in

730
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,470
You

731
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:40,210
You

732
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,970
Okay, so I'll go ahead and grade it now and

733
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,990
Let's see how people did on this one

734
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,390
So the correct answer is B

735
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:03,850
Which is that the log base 10 of 2 is approximately 0.3 and it looks like 1850 of you correctly got that

736
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,270
so congratulations, but the close contender

737
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,750
not at all a

738
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:16,650
Unanimous decision here looks like it was D. Which is that the log base 10 of 2 is around 1 third so that's good

739
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,110
They're very numerically similar right that

740
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,630
It's either 0.3 or around 1 third which is 0.3 3 3 3 repeating

741
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:29,450
But the question was asking which one is closest to being true, and let's see how we can think about this so

742
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,890
It points out that you have a power of 2 which is

743
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:41,230
1024 awfully close to a power of 10 about 10 cubed and the question is how we can leverage this to understand something like

744
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:48,230
Log base 2 of 10 or log base 10 of 2 as we saw earlier those are just the reciprocals of each other

745
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,590
So what does this mean if log base 2 of 10 is equal to X?

746
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:58,450
That's the same thing as saying 2 to the X is equal to 10 right. It's asking us 2 to the what equals 10

747
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,530
So what we have here is an expression

748
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:09,150
10 cubed is approximately equal to 2 to the 10th so what I might write out is we know that 2 to the 10th

749
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:14,710
Instead of writing it as a 10. I'm going to write that 10 as 2 to the X

750
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:20,590
Where X is the number such that 2 to the X is approximate is equal to 10?

751
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,130
So if that cubed is the same as 2 to the 10th

752
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:31,010
This is I'll just write out the full details the same as saying 2 to the 3 X is equal to 2 to the 10th

753
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:32,890
and

754
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:37,230
Exponentiation is a nice one-to-one function, so it's okay to just

755
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:42,210
Say whatever is going on in the input if the outputs are the same the inputs must also be the same

756
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,790
You can't do that with every function people seem to think you can do that with any function

757
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:49,030
But you just can't and what that means is that?

758
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,490
X is about

759
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,110
X is about 10 thirds, okay

760
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:56,850
which

761
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:57,810
Ah

762
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:04,170
Great so log base 2 of 10 is about 10 thirds, so if we looked at our answers though

763
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:09,550
That's not actually any of the options. We've got various things asking log base 2 of 10

764
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:16,670
being around 0.3 or 1 third so it looks like instead we should try to re-express this as log base 10 of 2 and

765
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:22,070
Well enough what we saw earlier is that log base 2 of 10 we could also say

766
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:24,930
log base 10 of 2 is

767
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:32,890
Just 1 over that amount 1 over X and you can see this pretty easily by writing 2 is equal to 10 to the 1 over

768
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:38,890
X if we're asking 10 to the what equals 2 the answer is 1 over what we just got there, so

769
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:43,890
Log base 10 of 2 is 1 divided by this amount

770
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,430
Which is 3 tenths?

771
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,850
Which is 0.3

772
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:48,950
great

773
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:54,910
So this is kind of a nice constant to think about because there's this wonderful pattern that happens when we're looking at

774
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,330
powers of 2 so if I ask

775
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,250
What is the log base 2 of?

776
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:01,930
1,000

777
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:07,110
Like we just saw it's approximately the case that 2 to the power 10

778
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,110
Is equal to a thousand and because we're doing things at logs

779
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:14,370
I'm just going to be writing it in that way a log 2 of a thousand is approximately 10

780
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,210
Similarly log base 2 of a million

781
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,790
Well, let's see if we have to multiply

782
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:28,830
2 by itself about 10 times to get to a thousand we should have to multiply it by itself around 20 times

783
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,730
to get up to a million and

784
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:34,290
Indeed log base 2 of a million is approximately 20

785
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,550
It's a little bit smaller, but this is kind of a nice approximation to have in your mind

786
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:45,410
And then similarly you'll see why I'm writing out this as a pattern in just a moment if we wanted to go up to a billion

787
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,170
Saying how many times do I have to multiply 2 by itself to get to a billion

788
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,150
This is about 30

789
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:59,210
And any computer scientist out there who's thought about you know just how much as a kilobyte or a megabyte or a gigabyte?

790
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,230
They'll be familiar with the idea that

791
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:08,350
Powers of 2 are nice and close to these powers of 10 or more specifically powers of a thousand now

792
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:13,090
What I want to do is just write all of the same things with log base 10

793
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:21,050
Not not approximately equal to this is actually equal to 3 log base 10 of a thousand. It's equal to 3

794
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:25,510
Log base 10 well you tell me what's log base 10 of a million

795
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:31,270
It's counting the number of zeros it ends up being about 6 and log base 10 of a billion

796
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:34,850
Counting the number of zeros it ends up being 9

797
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:42,350
Now the reason I wanted to write all of this out is to just emphasize an interesting pattern here

798
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:48,690
Which is we're just growing by these increments right as we go from a thousand to a million to a billion with log base 2

799
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,950
We're stepping up by steps of 10

800
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:56,090
But when we're playing the same game with 10 we're stepping up by these increments of 3

801
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:02,430
So there's this nice relationship and in fact for all of them to go from log base 2 to log base 10

802
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:07,990
It seems like we're just multiplying by 0.3. So 10 times 0.3 is 3

803
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:14,110
20 we scale down by that same amount 30 we scale down by that same amount

804
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,130
Okay

805
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:20,090
now this is an intuition worth remembering if you have

806
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:27,270
Your numbers described with one base. It's basically the same as describing them with another base, but there's some rescaling constant

807
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:30,710
Okay, and then the next question is going to start getting us at that direction

808
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,150
But it's going to be framed in a way that just looks like a whole pile of algebra

809
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:38,870
And again, I will encourage you to plug in numbers if you want to to gain a little intuition for it

810
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,050
So as our third to last question, this will be a long lecture

811
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:49,310
We have which of the following is true and then just a whole pile of

812
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:55,190
Various possible ways to combine log base C of B times log base C of A

813
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:00,250
Does that equal log base B log base B of A and rather than me reading them out to you?

814
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:03,050
I'll just let you look through them plug in some numbers

815
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:09,910
I'll give you I'll give you a meaningful time on this one because it's not it's not obvious unless you're already familiar with logarithms and

816
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,450
It's worth thinking through a little bit

817
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:20,370
You

818
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,610
We have an outstanding question from the audience

819
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:34,050
Which is does the bar length of the pole use some kind of log function and healthily?

820
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:41,010
It looks like Ben Eater has gone ahead and directly answered in the form of the code involved where the chart max is

821
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,110
mapped up is the

822
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:45,390
raising 2 to the power of a

823
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:52,270
Ceiling of a log base 2 of the maximum attempt count which I think is to say unraveling

824
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,350
If you're looking at the maximum number

825
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:59,890
I'm not I'm not great at Vanna whiting this thing if you look at the maximum number in our poll

826
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,290
It's asking what's the log base 2 of that?

827
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:06,710
so as it crosses different powers of 2 then that rescales it and

828
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:13,010
Yes, yes is the answer what a fantastically apropos question Thank You Karen

829
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:18,550
All right, so answers are still rolling in and I think like I said

830
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:22,990
I just want to give you some more time to think this through because it's looks like a big pile of algebra

831
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:27,970
plug in some numbers to see what seems to work well and

832
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:29,990
See which answer fits

833
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,590
You

834
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:19,770
You

835
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,990
You

836
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,830
Okay, so even if you are still thinking about it

837
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,830
I'm gonna go ahead and grade it here and then start talking about

838
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:49,190
Why it's true and then also why we should care why this is an operation that actually tells us something

839
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:54,950
so the correct answer which it looks like around 1700 of you got congratulations is

840
01:08:55,970 --> 01:09:02,390
Log base C of B times log base B of A is equal to log base C of A

841
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:03,290
great

842
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:08,390
Now that's just a big ol pile of things. Why would that be true? How do we think about it?

843
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:15,450
Now phase one, like I said, we might plug in an example, but let's try to actually think about why the example holds. So let me

844
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:20,950
Pull out we've got this as one more of the log rules

845
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:27,830
This is just repeating the end what the correct answer turned out to be where we've got an expression for

846
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:33,050
Log base C of B log base B of A and this ends up being log base C of A

847
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,650
It's gotten rid of the B's which is kind of interesting

848
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,830
so

849
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:42,050
Some examples you might plug in here would be things like let's use a different color. Let's use green

850
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,770
Instead of C. I'm gonna go ahead and plug in 10

851
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:54,410
Log base 10 of 100 which is kind of asking how many times does 10 go into a

852
01:09:54,410 --> 01:10:01,330
100 in a multiplicative sense how many times do I multiply 10 by itself to get to 100 where the answer is 2 and

853
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,230
then log of

854
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,270
100 of

855
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,450
Let's plug in another power of 10

856
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,070
It'll be nice if it's also a power of 100

857
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:10,990
So I'll do a million

858
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:12,670
So

859
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:16,010
This one is asking 10 to 100 to the what equals a million

860
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:21,410
How many times do I multiply a hundred by itself to get to a million? How many times does a hundred go into a million?

861
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:30,150
Phrasing the same thing 10 different ways now the claim is that this is the same thing as taking log base 10 of a million

862
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:38,090
That if I ask how many times does 10 go into 100 and how many times does 100 go into a million?

863
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:46,510
Multiplying those should give me the answer to how many times 10 goes into a million now just checking the numbers this certainly works

864
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,630
10 goes into a hundred two times

865
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:53,990
100 goes into a million

866
01:10:54,730 --> 01:11:00,210
three times in a multiplicative sense in that a hundred cubed is equal to a million and

867
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,630
Indeed how many times does 10 go into a million?

868
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,470
well six

869
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:11,350
Now we could think of this property in terms of the corresponding exponent rule which is going to look a little bit stranger

870
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,830
But it's actually just saying the entirely the same thing

871
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,530
So here we're if we have a base of C and a base of B

872
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,630
And we're trying to relate those to each other the whole statement is

873
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:27,750
equal to saying that um suppose that B to the X is equal to a

874
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:31,610
Got some number B. You raise it to some number X and equals a suppose

875
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:37,910
It's also the case that C to the Y equals B. Those two together are the same as saying C to the XY equals a

876
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,630
Now that's kind of a mouthful to say out loud

877
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:47,080
But if you plug in some numbers to translate what all of that is really saying in the context of the example we just did

878
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:52,730
Saying if you can write a hundred is ten squared and if you can write a million as a hundred cubed

879
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,590
Well that lets you write a million in terms of a power of ten

880
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,870
Okay, so sort of asking this question

881
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:02,470
How many times does one number go into another?

882
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,630
But letting you layer it on top of each other

883
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:12,210
Now if we rearrange that expression we get what is probably the second most important of all of our log rules

884
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:16,430
The most important is this top one that when you multiply the inputs you add the outputs

885
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:20,790
But the second most important which is known as the change of base formula

886
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:27,270
Lets us rate that if you want the log base B of some value a

887
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:33,530
Then for whatever C you want it doesn't actually matter what log you have in your pocket if you use that other log

888
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:39,910
And you take the log C of a divided by the log C of B that gives you log base B of a

889
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:47,030
Okay, so just as an example here what this would look like is let's say I wanted to be able to compute log base

890
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:52,630
100 of things I just really want to it's not a button on my calculator, but I would love to be able to do it

891
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,190
and I want to do it in

892
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:00,990
With an input like a million well even if I don't have the log base 100 button on my calculator

893
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:07,230
what I can do is say I'll use the log base 10 button and

894
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:15,550
Evaluate what's on the inside here which at least positionally it's kind of above the 100 it has a higher altitude as we write it so

895
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:21,550
This can line up with the notation a little bit that it sits on the numerator and on the bottom

896
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:27,950
I use the log base 10 button that's in my calculator on the base on the 100 and

897
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:32,810
Then I can evaluate both of those and it'll give me the answer in this case it gets you 6 divided by 2

898
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:34,870
which will be 3 and

899
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:39,430
If we really just think through what this is saying I know I've said it many different times

900
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:42,750
But it's a it's a convoluted enough way to write things

901
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:48,770
but an intuitive enough fact that I think just coming at it from a bunch of different angles can be important because like I said

902
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,030
This is probably the second most important log rule

903
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:59,310
We're asking how many times does 100 go into a million in a multiplicative sense how many times we multiply by itself?

904
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:06,550
But division is asking that same question in an additive sense if I say how many times does the log of 100 go into the?

905
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:12,830
Log of a million that's what division means it's saying how many times do I add this bottom number to itself to get to the top?

906
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:19,630
But anything additive in the logarithm realm is the same as anything multiplicative in terms of what's inside the parentheses

907
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:25,470
So both of the left-handed side and the right-hand side are just saying how many times does 100 go into a million?

908
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,730
But going about that in different ways

909
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,250
So this is extremely nice because it actually lets us compute things

910
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:38,050
next time we're going to talk all about the natural logarithm, which is log base e often written ln and

911
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:41,370
Turns out this is much easier to compute

912
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:46,250
There's nice math behind it such that if you want to come up with an algorithm that your calculator can use

913
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,210
It's actually a lot easier to think of log base e of numbers

914
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:55,750
So anytime that you need to go to some kind of calculator. I don't know let's say we popped over to something like Desmos

915
01:14:56,270 --> 01:15:01,230
Always happy to have as a friend, and you wanted to compute log base 10 of

916
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:04,770
Some number you know let's say we're doing log base 10 of

917
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:12,210
57 and it looks like that's you know it should make sense. It's between 1 and 2 because 57 was between 10 and 100

918
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:16,110
What's going on under the hood? How is it actually figuring this out?

919
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:19,170
It's going to use somewhere in there a change of base formula

920
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:26,490
Which is going to be that the natural log of 57 divided by the natural log of 10 is the same thing

921
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:32,150
These are two different ways of writing it so if you know one logarithm. You know all of the logarithms okay, and

922
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,510
Well, let's just use that fact to answer one more of our quiz questions

923
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:41,890
And this will be the second to last quiz question, so thank you all for sticking it through

924
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:45,650
I think we will be I

925
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:49,730
Think you'll be pleased by the last question because the last question will actually be like a fun

926
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:55,390
Problem-solving puzzle II thing and it'll involve a lot of what we've used up to this point kind of a culminating thing

927
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:59,990
So before that though just to make sure that we've got the instincts of

928
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:03,670
Change of base down. What do we have?

929
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:10,690
Use the approximation that log base 2 of 10 is around 10 thirds so using that approximation

930
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:13,570
Which of the following is approximately true?

931
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,470
Log base 2 of X is about 10 thirds of log base 10 of X

932
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:25,030
Log base 2 of X is log base 10 of 10 thirds of X log base 2 of X is

933
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:28,310
log base 10 of X to the power 10 thirds or

934
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:33,890
Log base 2 of X is 10 thirds times the log base 10 of X and finally none of the above

935
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:39,710
So I'll give you a moment to think about that you might want to think to the chart that we were drawing earlier and thinking

936
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:47,530
about log base 2 and log base 10 as we're looking at powers of 1000 and how each of those grows that can leverage some of

937
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,950
The intuition but I'll let you think about it. Stop talking

938
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:10,250
You

939
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:22,860
While answers are rolling in it looks like a number of people have been asking on Twitter about

940
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:29,290
Basically how complex numbers play into this so you know we've got Jamil asking

941
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:30,710
What if the base is imaginary?

942
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:31,730
We've got

943
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:38,410
Kelcon asking what about complex bases since e to the X is walking around the spiral wouldn't it hit every complex number

944
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:43,750
Well it won't hit every complex number, but your instinct that it's hitting multiple things is pretty spot-on

945
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:50,240
Doesn't make sense to talk about logs with imaginary numbers by Nitya so to all of these questions. It's actually a very

946
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:57,530
Nuanced question the short answer is yes complex logarithms absolutely exist

947
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:02,870
But each one of them has multiple different outputs so a good a good analogy here is how?

948
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:07,410
If we have the square root function if I ask something like the square root of 5

949
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:13,370
You know we have the convention that you always do the positive amount, but that doesn't quite feel honest

950
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:20,970
It feels like the right answer is to specify that there's two different outputs for the square root function two solutions to x squared

951
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,610
equals 25

952
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:29,270
And this is actually true in complex numbers as well one of the things we talked about in a complex number lecture

953
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:36,590
Was that you can take the square root of I and you actually get root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I?

954
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:44,030
But that there's two solutions you can do plus or minus this value and so you could say that the square root function

955
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:46,610
Isn't a function, but it's a multi-valued function

956
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:51,410
It always has two different outputs now something funky happens when we have exponents at play

957
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:56,650
So if you're just like someone who hasn't seen this stuff don't worry. We talked about it in previous lectures

958
01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:02,130
I'm obviously jumping around on the complexity level a lot here where if in lecture 5 I'm talking about

959
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:07,890
Like Euler's formula with complex numbers and compound interest and like how that plays into physics and then lecture 6

960
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:11,330
We're back to the basics of logarithms. I acknowledge that might be a little bit

961
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:19,810
jarring to potential audience members, but just continuing on with the answer if you note that e to the

962
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:25,150
2 pi times you know some number times I

963
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:31,890
This basically walks you around a circle so that the output will

964
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:35,990
Walk around a circle and just keep repeating as n goes from 0 up to 1

965
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:41,410
It'll walk around one cycle and end up back where you started as n goes from 1 to 2

966
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:47,890
You'll end up back where you started so for example e to the 0 sits here e to the I pi

967
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:51,710
Is at negative 1 but e to the 2 pi I is?

968
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,810
also at 1 same with

969
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:01,730
Excuse me same with e to the 4 pi

970
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,990
I

971
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,150
that also

972
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:11,730
Equals 1 so in general if you wanted to ask something like what is the log base e of 1?

973
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:15,470
You know on the one hand we want to say the log of

974
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:19,610
Log base anything of 1 should be 0 because anything to the power 0 equals that 1

975
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:24,410
But if we're letting complex numbers into the mix you would have to honestly say well

976
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:30,210
2 pi I is another pretty good answer to this question because e to the 2 pi I also equals 1 and

977
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:36,410
Same with 4 pi I and you could even go in the negative direction and in general n times pi

978
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:40,010
Times 2 times I kind of wrote that in a weird order

979
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:43,170
for any integer in

980
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:47,670
Feels like a valid answer to this question

981
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:53,770
So there's a couple ways that you can deal with that in math and before we get back to our usual lesson

982
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,990
Just on logarithm rules. This is interesting enough. I kind of want to pull it up

983
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,030
Let's see what if we have complex logarithm

984
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:01,610
uh

985
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:03,110
Great

986
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:10,670
Wikipedia always to our aid probably it'll have a nice like visual of some kind for us look such fancy color diagrams

987
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:15,610
What I want okay. This is what I want wonderful. Let's zoom out a little bit

988
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:19,030
Great, so there's this notion of what's called a Riemann surface

989
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:23,510
That's basically trying to capture the idea that you have a function with multiple outputs and intuitively

990
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:28,090
Maybe you can understand what it's getting at where the input would be something on the XY plane and the output

991
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:34,370
There's just many different outputs sitting there so when you have a complex logarithm you have to account for that, but it's used

992
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,750
It's actually a very useful idea

993
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:40,570
To do but it takes a lot more nuance than than you might expect

994
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,490
So with all of that hopefully that helped

995
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:48,570
At least partially answer some of people's questions same same by the way with

996
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:55,650
Logarithms with based negative numbers because if you're asking like negative 1 to the X and really noodling on what that means it's

997
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,810
It gets you into the realm of

998
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:04,110
Complex numbers, so you have to deal with the same multiple output idea now

999
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:09,350
answers are rolling in more slowly so this seems like a fine time to grade things and

1000
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,670
the answer turns out to be

1001
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:17,630
You rescale it if you want to go from log base 2 of something to log base 10 of something

1002
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:24,390
It involves rescaling and one way you could think about this is with the change of base formula, so let's say we have

1003
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,550
Let's get rid of our e stuff

1004
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,330
Let's say you have

1005
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:35,730
Log base 2 of X, but we want to write it in terms of log base 10

1006
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:40,010
We can write that as log base 10 of X

1007
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:47,810
Divided by log base 10 of 2 saying how many times does 2 go into X in a multiplicative sense is

1008
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:53,250
The same as saying how many times does the log of 2 go into the log of X in an additive sense, okay?

1009
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:54,450
And

1010
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:58,710
Well, what is 1 divided by the log base 10 of 2?

1011
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:03,470
so we're going to keep our log base 10 of X out here and

1012
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,390
From what we found earlier

1013
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:09,330
We found that log base 10 of 2 was approximately

1014
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:15,650
3 tenths was approximately 0.3. So when we divide by it that should get us 10 thirds

1015
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:22,590
Okay, and this lines up with what we were looking at a little bit earlier with powers of 1000. Let's see. Where was it?

1016
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:25,730
Great

1017
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,330
So when we're converting from log base 10 of something up to log base 2

1018
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:34,170
You know here we were thinking of multiplying the top by 0.3 to get to the bottom

1019
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,950
But you could also think of multiplying by 10 thirds to get to the top

1020
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:43,090
Anytime you have log base 10 of some number you just rescale it and you have log base 2 of that number and the rescaling

1021
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:48,590
Constant comes from the log base 2 of 10 or vice versa log base 10 of 2

1022
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,710
So that's change of base like I said, it's very important

1023
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:58,130
It lets you put everything into a nice universal language and that should be all of the hint that you need for the last question

1024
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:04,130
Which is a challenge question on this one. So if anyone's been watching and they've been like I know logarithms. I've got this

1025
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,330
completely down

1026
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:10,230
Let me pull up the last question which came up on let's see

1027
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:14,270
It's not the AMC, but it's whatever the predecessor to the AMC was I believe

1028
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:18,550
So it's you know, it's gonna involve a little cleverness and manipulation

1029
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:21,150
We've got this long

1030
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:25,990
Sequence of fractions. Okay, you take 1 divided by the log base 2 of a hundred factorial

1031
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:31,910
And remember 100 factorial is a hundred times 99 times 98 on the way all the way down to 1

1032
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:37,350
so 1 divided by the log base 2 of that plus 1 divided by the log base 3 of

1033
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:38,850
100 factorial

1034
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:46,350
Plus 1 divided by log base 4 of 100 factorial on and on and on up until 1 divided by the log base 100 of 100

1035
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:46,910
factorial

1036
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:49,970
So this looks rather intimidating, right?

1037
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:55,750
Certainly adding fractions is never fun adding 100 fractions seems even worse

1038
01:24:55,750 --> 01:25:01,370
Dealing with a bunch of logs of different bases seems like a pain and the factorial is playing into this

1039
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:07,230
So I'm just gonna give you you know, given that this is the wind down time. I'm gonna give you

1040
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:12,250
Two or three minutes to start thinking about this and if you don't get it, it's totally fine

1041
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:19,770
We're gonna walk through what the answer is, but I'm just gonna let people think about this final challenge question before we call it a day

1042
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:39,730
You

1043
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:10,490
You

1044
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:51,790
You

1045
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:34,270
You

1046
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:38,270
You

1047
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:44,730
So I'm gonna give you a little bit more time on this one because it's definitely

1048
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:50,390
It's definitely fun to work out and I think if you know how to start then great

1049
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:54,750
But if you don't know how to start just letting yourself kind of work with a couple of the different

1050
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,270
rules that we've worked out before

1051
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:01,350
Change of base it comes into play if you'd like to use that

1052
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,170
And just kind of keep manipulating and if it feels like you're getting something that's a little too messy

1053
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:09,410
see if you come at it from a different angle and

1054
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:13,770
Because answers are rolling in a little bit more slowly now

1055
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:21,730
What I'm going to do is just start to describe the explanation here and then come back to grade it in just a moment here. So

1056
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,130
the expression that we have

1057
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:31,430
Looks like I just started writing it out while you guys were working on it one divided by log base two of a hundred factorial

1058
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:37,450
Plus one divided by log base three of a hundred factorial and before you even start the fact that the thing on the inside of

1059
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:43,130
The log involves a big product of stuff should actually feel good because logs like to take in things that look like products

1060
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:45,990
because of the most important property that we have which

1061
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:49,690
Is the idea that it turns products into addition?

1062
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:53,870
Okay, so right away, you know that you're probably going to use that second thing

1063
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,450
You notice is that it's uncomfortable to have all of these different bases log base

1064
01:28:57,450 --> 01:29:01,050
2 of something log base 3 of something log base 100 of something so

1065
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:05,750
Translating it all into the common language should be helpful. How does change of base work?

1066
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:10,650
Well asking how many times does to go into a hundred factorial is the same as asking?

1067
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:15,310
How many times does the log of to divide into the log of a hundred factorial?

1068
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:21,750
It doesn't even matter what logarithm you use this log could be base 10 base e base 2 doesn't matter this change of base formula

1069
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:27,430
Still holds now what that means for our expression is instead of taking one divided by log base

1070
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,370
2 of 100 factorial I could write that as

1071
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:33,350
log of 2

1072
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:41,110
Divided by so let me draw a little dividing line between what I'm doing here log of 2 divided by log of

1073
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:42,890
100 factorial

1074
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,410
Okay, and then similarly?

1075
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:47,970
log of 3

1076
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:50,710
divided by log of

1077
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:54,490
100 factorial so all I'm doing here is taking

1078
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:59,450
The reciprocal so instead of taking log of 100 factorial over log of 2

1079
01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:03,570
I have inverted it log of 2 over 100 factorial because that's what this reciprocal is doing

1080
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:08,930
so with that as the beginning I'm gonna go ahead and just grade this lock in the answers and

1081
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,910
See how see how everyone's doing

1082
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:15,190
So it looks like

1083
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,510
awesome

1084
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,870
around

1085
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:25,670
1796 we always we always draw a little bit north of Ramanujan's number around 1800 of you

1086
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,470
Answered that it's one which is correct congratulations

1087
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:34,650
70 of you answered 100 which we can maybe see where where that our error would have come from

1088
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:40,710
Those of you that answered zero that's interesting it would imply that somehow you have cancellation at play

1089
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:44,530
Because these are all positive numbers so thinking one of them was negative

1090
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:47,330
So you could probably gut check against the idea that it would be zero

1091
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:51,840
41 of you want me to come up with a number fun numerical fact about 69, but I won't

1092
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:56,960
28 of you said 2 and I think yeah, I think that's I

1093
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:04,730
Think the the difference between 1 and 100 maybe would be interesting to try to analyze, but if we go back to our answer I

1094
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:08,390
Realize it may be a little bit confusing how I've heard this this isn't this is not a big fraction

1095
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:10,810
this was just a dividing line between

1096
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:16,590
Not true ironically trying not to confuse my fractions with each other so

1097
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:25,210
rewriting our expression up on the top here as we add all of these things and we can continue up until

1098
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:33,070
log of 100 all divided by log of 100 factorial

1099
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:38,690
The key is that now all of the denominators are the same so we can add the numerators

1100
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:45,270
No more plus sign is just going to equal something that top is going to look like log of 2

1101
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:50,510
Plus log of 3 plus on and on

1102
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:53,630
up to log of

1103
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:59,070
100 all divided by the log of

1104
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:03,810
100 factorial and it seems like the only little contention among those answering the question is

1105
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:08,510
whether this should simplify to be 1 or should it simplify to be a hundred and

1106
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:15,530
Really the way we can think about this is to just break down that bottom part in terms of what a factorial means

1107
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:21,430
I'll go ahead and do this on the bottom part since I didn't manage my paper real estate very effectively here

1108
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:24,110
the log of 100 times

1109
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:25,850
99 times

1110
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:33,430
98 on and on times 2 times 1 is the same as adding all of them and

1111
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:37,290
You can probably see this mostly cancels out with the top the only question you might have though

1112
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:41,550
Is that in the factorial can we keep multiplying down until we get that one?

1113
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:46,930
Which doesn't really make a difference, but before you think about it too much you might wonder

1114
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:52,890
Hang on you know on the bottom. I'm multiplying everything, and I'm adding this log of 1 but on the top

1115
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:57,810
From what we found before I never saw that log of 1 does that make any difference and the answer is no

1116
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:03,370
Because log of 1 is saying 10 to the power of what equals 1 and the answer is 0

1117
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:04,990
So in fact

1118
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:11,250
Taking the log of 100 factorial is the same as adding the logs of all the numbers from 2 up to 100 and it simplifies

1119
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:17,730
Down to 1 so to those of you who got it congratulations to those of you who feel like you maybe have better intuitions for

1120
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:21,850
Change of base formulas for the fact that logarithms turn multiplication into addition

1121
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:27,290
That's my hope in the next time with this as a foundation of logarithms that can be pointed back to

1122
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:30,650
What I would love to talk about is what's known as the natural logarithm

1123
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:35,790
Log base e and try to give an instinct for why that's something that we care about okay

1124
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:40,890
Why is it that mathematicians just seem to really love the number e sitting in the base of their logarithms?

1125
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:43,730
What does that buy for them? Why does it show up in nature?

1126
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:49,910
So that will happen on Friday at the same time as this lecture, and I look forward to seeing everyone there

1127
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:06,790
You
