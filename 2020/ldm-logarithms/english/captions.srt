1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,840
...

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,498
you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you 

3
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:19,884
you you you it ends up looking like this, you know, 

4
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:31,957
classic exponential curve that curves upward and I can sometimes make it hard to see 

5
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:44,313
where it's going or what the overall pattern is so a common trick is to say instead of 

6
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:56,244
looking at this y axis that increases linearly as in here I'm going from 5k to 10k, 

7
00:01:56,244 --> 00:02:08,317
10k to 15k, 15k to 20k each step is additive, we're adding 5000 instead use a y axis 

8
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:19,537
where each step is multiplicative so you're going from 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 

9
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:32,036
1000 to 10, 10,000 all of these are increases by multiplying by 10 and what you can say 

10
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:44,108
is the y axis is now plotting not the total number of cases but the logarithm of the 

11
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:56,607
total number of cases and this actually makes it kind of easier to see on a plot if you 

12
00:02:56,607 --> 00:03:05,413
wanted to project out what that trend would do and, you know, 

13
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:18,196
it's a little bit of a naive model to say oh it's going to grow exactly exponentially but 

14
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:30,695
in the early phases of something like this that is what it is so I kind of fast forward 

15
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:43,194
in the animation I made for that video and what's interesting is if back then I think I 

16
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:55,834
posted it on March 6th if you just found a line of best fit and you stretched it out and 

17
00:03:55,834 --> 00:04:08,333
you said when is that line going to cross a million which because the y axis is growing 

18
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:20,974
with multiplicative steps each time that you step up you're multiplying by 10 so even if 

19
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:32,762
it might seem like the 20,000 cases or so that it was back then is very far from a 

20
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:45,403
million you know when you understand logarithmic scales it actually didn't seem that far 

21
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:58,044
it was only 30 days away if you naively just drew out that line and in fact fast forward 

22
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:09,833
to around April 5th which is when that would have predicted we hit a million cases 

23
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:22,615
outside China that's pretty much the day that it happened I think plus or minus a day but 

24
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:34,262
I don't remember exactly but it was right in that neighborhood because I remember 

25
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:46,477
thinking wow it was kind of a naive model for the video to even use and it's shocking 

26
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:59,260
that it matched so exactly thankfully since then the growth has stopped being exponential 

27
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:11,332
so if you look at it on a logarithmic plot instead of going up in a straight line it 

28
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:23,263
starts to taper off but point being any time that you're coming across something in 

29
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:34,483
nature or even in a man-made construct where what's natural to think about are 

30
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:47,266
multiplicative increases logarithms come in to help you so let's go ahead and think about 

31
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:59,765
what these actually are how are they defined and actually there was a question asked on 

32
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:12,406
Twitter right before we started that I think hits this very perfectly so Max 182 asks us 

33
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:24,762
additions inverse is subtraction multiplications inverse is division but I never truly 

34
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:37,261
understood if exponentiations inverse was nth rooting or logarithms if either one could 

35
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:48,908
be you know if either one could really be called that way can they that is such a 

36
00:07:48,908 --> 00:08:00,838
fantastic question Max and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and 

37
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:12,911
multiplication you're not I'll just draw it out for you actually this is going to be 

38
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:25,410
easiest if we have some kind of exponential relationship let's say 10 to the power 3 is 

39
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:37,909
equal to 1000 there's three different numbers at play here we're showing a relationship 

40
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:50,691
between the 10, the 3 and the 1000 and aside from writing it with an exponent there's two 

41
00:08:50,691 --> 00:09:03,332
other ways we could write that same relationship we could also say that the cube root of 

42
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:15,973
1000 is equal to 10 this is asking 1000 what number raised to the third is equal to 1000 

43
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:28,188
that's sort of what the cube root is asking and another way that you could phrase the 

44
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:40,402
exact same thing is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3 okay three different 

45
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:52,759
notations the same exact relationship a while ago I made this video about an alternate 

46
00:09:52,759 --> 00:10:04,690
possible notation that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship 

47
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:17,188
between the three numbers with a triangle where you'd have our 10 sitting down here the 

48
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:29,545
power sitting at the top 10 to the third and the thing they equal sitting to the lower 

49
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:42,328
right and whenever you want to talk about a function or an operation between two of these 

50
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:54,827
numbers you indicate which one of them you're leaving out so to write 10 cubed we would 

51
00:10:54,827 --> 00:11:06,899
include the 10 on the lower left the 3 on the upper right and then we leave out that 

52
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:19,682
bottom one so this is indicating that we're taking a power 10 cubed for that radical what 

53
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:32,181
you would say is we know what's on the bottom right something to some power equals 1000 

54
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:44,538
we even know what the power is something cubed equals that 1000 but the thing we don't 

55
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:56,184
know is on the bottom left that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of 

56
00:11:56,184 --> 00:12:08,967
exponentiation where if the thing you don't know instead of being on that bottom right is 

57
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:21,608
on the bottom left but what logarithms are it's an inverse in another sense because what 

58
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:30,556
it's saying is in this triangle relationship we know the base, 

59
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:43,339
it's 10 we know the power that it should be 1000 but the thing we don't know is what's in 

60
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:55,980
that exponent so to answer your question maybe even more briefly we could say that 10 to 

61
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:05,496
the x the inverse of that the inverse is the log base 10 you know, 

62
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:18,278
of y of some other variable whereas if you're taking x to the 10th some unknown raised to 

63
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:30,777
a power the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value and on the 

64
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:43,560
triangle it's basically asking which of the things do we consider to be a variable so are 

65
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:56,059
you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity are you considering that top 

66
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:08,700
to be a variable quantity and what is the unknown but I really liked this idea of making 

67
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:20,914
explicit how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact one of 

68
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:33,697
them you're using relative positions of the numbers one of them we introduce a new symbol 

69
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:41,367
this radical and one of them we introduce a new word, 

70
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:54,150
log so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong 

71
00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:05,512
and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation and while I don't 

72
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:16,875
necessarily think that oh we should teach logarithms with this triangle because 

73
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:28,521
convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual 

74
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:40,736
expression what I do like about it and starting off with it is when you see and think 

75
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:52,382
about this triangle it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that 

76
00:15:52,382 --> 00:16:04,597
exponent every time that you see log of some value you should think in your mind okay 

77
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:17,238
whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent it wants to be an exponent and 

78
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:29,737
we'll see more of what that means as we go on okay so every time you see a log it wants 

79
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:42,520
to be an exponent this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting 

80
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:54,734
on top of whatever that base is now in terms of convention for the first part of this 

81
00:16:54,734 --> 00:17:07,517
video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it to be the shorthand for 

82
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:19,732
log base 10 because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there you should 

83
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:32,088
know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean 

84
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:44,729
log base e there's also another notation for that ln for natural log we're going to talk 

85
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:56,802
all about the natural log next time so don't worry too much about that right now and 

86
00:17:56,802 --> 00:18:09,017
there's also yet another convention often if you're in a computer science setting log 

87
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:21,799
without any added sugar to indicate what it is defaults to meaning log base 2 so this can 

88
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:34,440
sometimes be a source of confusion but it basically depends on what discipline you're in 

89
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:46,655
in math, not moth, math people really like a base of e we'll see why next lecture in, 

90
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:59,438
I don't know, I'll say engineering but really it's anything where you want good intuition 

91
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:11,936
with our normal base 10 number system log means log base 10 and if you're curious often 

92
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:23,015
in computer science settings log base 2 comes up all the time so like I said, 

93
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:34,946
in the back of your mind if you're trying to think of some of these properties just 

94
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:47,444
resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number that can 

95
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:58,949
get you a really far way so we're going to start going through a couple of these 

96
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:10,311
properties and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples so we'll 

97
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:23,094
transition away from the poll and this time to the first proper question and the question 

98
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:29,060
asks you which of the following is true a.

99
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,371
the log of 1000 times x is equal to 3 times the log of x and 

100
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:39,380
remember we're using the convention that it's base 10 log b.

101
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,080
log of 1000 times x equals log of x cubed c.

102
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,240
log of 1000 times x equals 3 plus the log of x d.

103
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,300
log of 1000 times x equals 3 to the power of log of x and e.

104
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,675
none of the above and remember like I said earlier we should fully expect that all of 

105
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:06,680
those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well they're going to be 

106
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,968
answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly but if you're someone who 

107
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:19,044
doesn't, don't let that intimidate you when you're looking at a problem like this one 

108
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:25,332
what I would encourage you to do is just plug in various powers of 10 and think in terms 

109
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:31,478
of the idea that the log function counts the number of zeros so I'll give you a little 

110
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:37,836
moment to think about that great ok so I'll go ahead and grade it and as always if that's 

111
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:43,983
faster than what you're comfortable with know that it's only because I want to proceed 

112
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:50,129
forward with the lesson so in this case the correct answer comes out to be log of 1000 

113
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:56,276
times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x and now let's think about that for a 

114
00:21:56,276 --> 00:22:02,563
moment and like I said when you're just getting started with them I think the best thing 

115
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:08,851
to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers and the best numbers to plug in 

116
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:15,210
are the ones that are already powers of 10 so if you're asking something like log of 1000 

117
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,427
times x well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x log of 1000 times 100 ok, 

118
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:27,714
well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here well 1000 times 100 

119
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:33,790
is 100,000 we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10 

120
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:39,866
we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000 the 2 zeros from that 100 and 

121
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:45,942
we're putting them next to each other so it should be 5 total zeros but if you really 

122
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:52,159
reflect not just on how did the number turn out but why did it turn out that way it was 

123
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,305
the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100 which we could also write by 

124
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:04,452
saying the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100 so this idea that a 

125
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:10,669
logarithm of the product of two things is the sum of the logarithms of those two things 

126
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:17,027
in the context of powers of 10 that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive 

127
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:23,244
idea for a lot of us if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them you just take all 

128
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:29,461
of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other so the way I've written things out 

129
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:35,820
here is actually indicative of a slightly more general fact which is going to be our very 

130
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:42,107
first property of logarithms which is that if we take the log of A times B it equals the 

131
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:48,324
log of A plus the log of B now anytime you see one of these logarithm rules if you find 

132
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:54,541
yourself squinting your eyes or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it just 

133
00:23:54,541 --> 00:24:00,900
plug in examples I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot but it's because I think it's 

134
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:07,188
very easy to forget once you're swamped in the algebra itself and you're sitting on some 

135
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:13,405
kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols to remind yourself you are okay to just 

136
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:19,268
plug in some numbers that's a fine thing to do and often it's a great way to yield 

137
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:25,415
intuition so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart we could just 

138
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:28,947
think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000 which is 5, 

139
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:35,306
there's 5 zeros in it and it breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part 

140
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:39,050
great, wonderful so carrying that intuition further, 

141
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,925
let's try another practice problem and again, if you know it, great, 

142
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:47,457
you'll be able to answer it fine but maybe think, 

143
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:53,674
not just what is the answer but how would I explain this answer to someone or how would 

144
00:24:53,674 --> 00:25:00,033
I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own without me having to tell them 

145
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:05,897
what the answer is so there's two potential audience members there's those who are 

146
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:12,114
interested in the lesson itself and then those who are interested in the meta lesson so 

147
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:16,353
our question asks, again, which of the following is true A, 

148
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:19,885
log of x to the n is equal to n times log of x B, 

149
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,912
log of x to the n is equal to log of x to the power n C, 

150
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:27,586
log of x to the n is equal to n plus log of x or D, 

151
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:33,591
log of x to the n is equal to log of n times log of x or none of the above so again, 

152
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:39,808
take a moment to answer as people do answer, we'll start to see them roll in and if you 

153
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:45,884
are struggling to think of where to even start just plug in some powers of 10 and see 

154
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:49,416
what intuition you might get from it you alright, 

155
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:55,704
so it looks like just about everybody is landing on one particular answer hopefully it's 

156
00:25:55,704 --> 00:26:01,568
the right answer, like I said, all to be expected so let's go ahead and see if our 

157
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:06,654
majority ended up correct and they did so the correct answer here is A, 

158
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:10,399
which it looks like 4000 of you got congratulations, 

159
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,980
telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x so again, 

160
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,985
let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone or if you're trying to come to 

161
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:28,273
grips with what it means yourself I think a fine place to start is plugging something in 

162
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:34,490
and in this case, for log of x to the power n let's just try it with 100 to the power 3 

163
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:40,636
and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work 

164
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:46,783
but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is but 

165
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:52,717
trying to think of why the answer turned out that way sometimes one example will do 

166
00:26:52,717 --> 00:26:56,674
because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking well, 

167
00:26:56,674 --> 00:27:02,961
that's 3 copies of 100 I'm taking 3 copies of 100 and when I multiply all that out and I 

168
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:06,988
think of log as counting the number of zeros we say, oh, 

169
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:13,347
it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it that's what it means to take 100 

170
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:19,422
times 100 times 100 I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together to get a 

171
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:25,569
million so this number is going to be 6 but if we think actually why was it 6 not just 

172
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:31,645
that's the number of zeros inside the million where that 6 came from is that we had 3 

173
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:37,791
copies of that 100 and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros so that way it's a more 

174
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:44,008
general way you can think about it where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking 

175
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:50,296
at 1000 cubed or 1000 to the n or x to the power n you can think that it's whatever that 

176
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:55,948
value of n was the number of copies we were multiplying in times the number of, 

177
00:27:55,948 --> 00:28:02,306
well let's see, it's not x times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted 

178
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:08,523
for x which in this case was 100 so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 

179
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:14,528
to the power n this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000 counting the 

180
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:20,887
number of zeros in each one of them which is 4 so it would be n times 4 and of course the 

181
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:27,174
general property that most of you correctly answered is that you have this lovely little 

182
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:33,391
effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power that little power hops 

183
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:39,679
down in front of it and you just have log of what was on the inside now one of the maybe 

184
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,826
most important implications of that I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if 

185
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:50,418
you'd call it a restatement of the definition if I'm taking log, 

186
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:56,776
and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10 of 10 to the power n we can kind of think of that 

187
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:02,993
little n as hopping down in front and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10 which is 

188
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:09,140
of course 1 this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at 

189
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:15,357
the end or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10 and the answer is simply 

190
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:21,644
1 which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this 

191
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:27,862
original expression is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n oh well the answer is n 

192
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:34,079
now with every given logarithm property that we have so in this case we just found one, 

193
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:40,154
log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front there's always going to be a 

194
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:45,877
mirror image exponential property and that's another way that we can help to get 

195
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:52,165
ourselves a little bit of intuition for these so let me just cover up some of the future 

196
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:58,382
properties we're going to get to here try to hide where we're going what we just found, 

197
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:04,175
raising something to the n that hops in front this corresponds to the exponential 

198
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:10,463
property that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n that's the 

199
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:16,680
same as taking 10 to the n times x and this gets us to another intuition that you might 

200
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,967
have for logarithms which is they kind of, they're like exponentiation turned inside out 

201
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:28,266
and here's what I mean by that the thing sitting on the inside of the log, 

202
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:34,483
if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for 

203
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:39,711
something that's exponential in this case the a, the thing on the inside, 

204
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:45,858
corresponds to 10 to the x the output of the function whereas the entire thing itself, 

205
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:52,004
the log of a corresponds to what's on the inside over here just what's the exponent of 

206
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:55,536
the 10 so wherever you see a log expression here, 

207
00:30:55,536 --> 00:31:01,612
you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side and every 

208
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:06,063
time you see an exponential the entire 10 to the x expression, 

209
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:12,351
the whole outer component on the right side that corresponds to something that's sitting 

210
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:16,307
on the inside of one of the logs and we saw this above, 

211
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:20,405
right the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside, 

212
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:26,481
that's adding on the outside well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out that's 

213
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:32,627
telling us that multiplying on the outside, multiplying the outputs of the function is 

214
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:36,937
the same as adding on the inside because each of these logs, 

215
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:42,942
like log a and log b is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the 

216
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:49,300
right okay, so with that, let's keep playing let's just do a couple more of these and see 

217
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:55,305
how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for so this last one, 

218
00:31:55,305 --> 00:32:01,522
very nice, thinking of exponents hopping down the next one is something that might look 

219
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:07,739
a little bit weird to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms but again, 

220
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:13,956
plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it and we'll give it a little bit more, 

221
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:17,560
a moment to pull up which of the following is true?

222
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:27,716
log base a of b is negative log base b of a log base a of b is 1 divided by log base b 

223
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:37,405
of a log base a of b is 1 minus log base b of a log base b of a is log base a of 1 

224
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:47,794
divided by b or none of the above so it's asking what happens when we swap the base with 

225
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:58,067
what's sitting inside of the logarithm and I'll just give you a minute or two to answer 

226
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:08,106
that so let's do a couple more okay, so it seems like answers have kind of stabilized 

227
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:15,461
out there so let's go ahead and grade things and in this case, 

228
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:25,383
the correct answer of the choices we have comes out to be b that the log base a of b 

229
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:31,920
involves taking 1 divided by the log base b of a again, 

230
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:42,310
let's think this through both in terms of an example and then in terms of a more proofy, 

231
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:52,583
systematic reason why it should be true so if we're swapping our bases let's just start 

232
00:33:52,583 --> 00:34:02,856
off with our good old friend log base 10 and let's plug in a nice power of 10 like 1000 

233
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:13,245
counting the number of zeros, we get 3 so let's try swapping the bases and see what this 

234
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:20,600
should mean log base 1000 of 10 okay, well what is this asking?

235
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,030
maybe you think of drawing the little triangle saying something like 

236
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,580
we know 1000 to something is equal to 10 1000 to the what equals 10?

237
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:40,366
well, if 10 cubed is 1000 that is the same thing as saying 10 is equal to 1000 raised 

238
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:46,984
to the 1 third doing the inverse here involves the multiplicative inverse of the 

239
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:53,766
exponent and the way that pans out is that it looks like 1 divided by 3 and that 3 

240
00:34:53,766 --> 00:35:00,629
corresponds to the log base 10 of 1000 it's 1 divided by the log base 10 of 1000 so 

241
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:07,410
more generally, you might guess based on this single example that when we swap the 

242
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:14,192
base with what's on the inside it corresponds to taking 1 divided by what's on the 

243
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:20,646
outside there and again, you can think this through in terms of looking at the 

244
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:28,000
corresponding exponential rule now what happened to my lovely little log and exponentials?

245
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,872
wonderful so, again let's hide where some of the things some of the other properties 

246
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:39,205
that we'll get to here and I'll keep it in the same order I had it before here I was 

247
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:44,600
thinking that having it pre-written could keep me a little bit cleaner than usual but 

248
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,183
maybe it just involves playing this weird game of paper cutting shuffling around so what 

249
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:53,320
we just found, log base b of a if you swap those, 

250
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,896
it's the same as dividing by 1 what this corresponds to, 

251
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:02,479
off an exponential land is if you take b to some power and say that that equals a that's 

252
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:07,561
the same statement as saying that a to the inverse of that power equals b again, 

253
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:12,831
it's kind of helpful to take a moment and think of the logarithms as turning things 

254
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:17,850
inside out the expression log base b of a is playing the role of that x and the 

255
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:23,433
expression log base a of b is playing the role of whatever sits on top of the a and then 

256
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:28,891
symmetrically, the whole expression b to the power x is playing the role of the inside 

257
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:33,032
on the left, it plays the role of the a and the whole expression, 

258
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:38,615
a to the power of something plays the role of what's sitting inside the log base a there 

259
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:43,634
so you can see just by plugging in some examples and by corresponding it to the 

260
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:49,155
exponential rules we can already think through three different logarithm rules which if 

261
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:53,797
they were just handed down as pieces of algebra to be memorized you know, 

262
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:59,130
you could memorize them but it's very easy for them to kind of slip out of your head 

263
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,399
and it's also very easy to get frustrated by the task at hand but you might want to 

264
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:09,732
remind yourself that the reason we care about these sorts of things is understanding 

265
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:15,065
the rules of logarithms helps us do math in contexts where it's like a virus growing 

266
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:18,766
where from one day to the next, from one step to the next, 

267
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:24,287
things tend to grow multiplicatively understanding the rules of logarithms helps you to 

268
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:29,682
get a better feel for that kind of stuff so before we do a nice real world example of 

269
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:35,203
what that can look like let me just do one more quiz question in this vein to ask about 

270
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:40,535
properties of logarithms one last one before we transition to a little bit of a real 

271
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:45,680
world example get rid of what we had here and now, which of the following is true?

272
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:52,261
log of a plus b is the same as log of a plus log of b log of a plus b is equal 

273
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:57,956
to log of a times log of b log of a plus b is equal to one divided by log of 

274
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:03,650
a plus log of b or log of a plus b is equal to one divided by log of a times 

275
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:09,640
log of b or none of the above ah, and now we don't have as much consensus, do we?

276
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:22,435
very interesting, we've got a horse race between two so I will give you a moment to 

277
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:34,417
think this through Ally Freed So, you know, I was just talking about how we might 

278
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:46,546
think in terms of multiplicative growth and that doesn't just have to be powers of 

279
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:58,675
10 We could also do something like powers of 3 or if you're going from 1 to 3 to 9 

280
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:10,366
to 27 to 81 all of these We could say that the log base 3 of these numbers Just 

281
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:23,080
grows in nice little steps So log base 3 of 1, 3 to the what equals 1, the answer is 0.

282
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,960
In general the log of 1 no matter the base will be 0.

283
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,363
Log base 3 of 3, 3 to the what equals 3 is 1 Similarly log 

284
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:36,045
base 3 of 9 is 2 You might wonder what my question is, 

285
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:41,920
but it'll help to draw all of these out and For my own pleasure here.

286
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,780
Let me just write out one more log base 3 of 81 is 4.

287
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,760
Now I've heard that ostensibly if you ask a child's let's say 

288
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,960
around like 5 or 6 years old What number is halfway between 1 and 9?

289
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay, you say what number is halfway?

290
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,805
Their instincts for how to answer are Logarithmic whereas our instincts tend to be more 

291
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:09,678
linear So we often think 1 and 9 you've got a bunch of evenly spaced numbers between 

292
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:14,552
them 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 And if you go right halfway in between you'll land on 5 But 

293
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:19,540
if you're thinking in terms of multiplicative growth where to get from 1 to 9 It's not 

294
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,413
a matter of adding a bunch of things But you're growing by a certain amount you grow 

295
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:29,573
by a factor of 3 then you grow by another factor of 3 supposedly a kid's natural instinct 

296
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:34,734
lines up with saying 3 and supposedly this also lines up with If you have anthropologists 

297
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:39,722
studying societies that haven't developed Counting systems and writing in the same way 

298
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:44,595
that modern societies have they'll answer 3 for this So my question for the audience 

299
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:49,469
if any of you watching right now have access to a small child Let's say in the range 

300
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:54,342
of 5 years old See if you can go ask them What number is halfway between 1 and 9 and 

301
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:59,387
if you can let us know on Twitter what the What the child says what their actual answer 

302
00:40:59,387 --> 00:40:59,560
is?

303
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,766
Because I I don't know why I'm just a little bit 

304
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,860
skeptical of whether that Actually pans out in practice.

305
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,106
I understand this is not a super scientific way to do it asking people watching a 

306
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:14,476
YouTube live stream to Survey their own children and then tweet the answer but for my 

307
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:18,642
own sake it would be interesting to see some kind of validation there Back to our 

308
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,100
question.

309
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,739
This is the first one that doesn't seem to have a huge Consensus in one direction, 

310
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:30,158
but let's go ahead and grade it to see what the answer turns out to be Great okay, 

311
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:35,774
so 2400 of you correctly answered that it's none of the above okay that log of a plus 

312
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:41,454
B doesn't satisfy any of these nice properties And in general unless we're going to be 

313
00:41:41,454 --> 00:41:47,200
working with Certain kinds of approximations especially when the natural log comes into 

314
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,751
play we might talk about this next time Adding the inputs of a logarithm is actually 

315
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:58,627
a very weird sensation It's a very weird thing to do and to get a sense of that weirdness 

316
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:04,177
plug in some powers of 10 If I ask you log of a plus B What you might start thinking 

317
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:04,700
is okay?

318
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:11,591
Let me just plug in some examples like 10,000 and 100 and I asked myself if I 

319
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:18,660
do this zero counting function of what's in that input how many zeros are in it?

320
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,342
But it's weird because when we add 10,100 well, 

321
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:26,120
we're no longer at a clean power of 10 and okay That's fine.

322
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:32,387
You know often you're taking logarithms of things that aren't clean 

323
00:42:32,387 --> 00:42:38,686
powers of 10 but it becomes very strange to ask how you express this 

324
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:44,620
in terms of log of 100 which was 2 and log of 10,000 Which was 4?

325
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:51,337
Because if you look at log of 10,100 it's asking 10 to the what is equal to 

326
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:57,030
10,100 You might say it's gonna be a little above 4 because it's kind of close 

327
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:02,580
to 10,000 so the best you might Guess here is oh, this is gonna be something.

328
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,406
That's kind of like The log of 10,000, but that just feels like a coincidence based on 

329
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:12,122
the two numbers that we happen to put in There's not a nice systematic reason coming 

330
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:17,116
there, so maybe you guess oh if the numbers A and B are very different It's kind of close 

331
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:21,887
to Whatever the maximum of them is But it's very bizarre and most importantly for the 

332
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:26,880
sake of the quiz If you just look at the options that it's giving you if you try this out 

333
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,763
with any particular numbers You'll find that none of those actually work So all is good 

334
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:36,423
sometimes you get something that looks like it's going to be a nice property But it 

335
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:41,361
doesn't end up being a nice property, and I also think that's important rather than just 

336
00:43:41,361 --> 00:43:46,243
finding yourself Only working with the various You know log of A times B or log of X to 

337
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:51,126
the power N these things that have a nice rule Sometimes you're out in the mathematical 

338
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:55,786
wild you're working on some problem You have a logarithm expression And it's adding 

339
00:43:55,786 --> 00:44:00,779
things in the input and you want to be able to Have familiarity with the fact that that's 

340
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:05,551
kind of weird that you're not going to be able to simplify But if you you know if you 

341
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:10,377
hadn't thought about that before you might wonder Oh is there just some formula that I 

342
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:15,315
haven't seen before So with all of that let me go ahead and take a couple questions from 

343
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:20,087
the audience Before we transition to a different sort of example So it looks like Uma 

344
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:22,140
Sherma asks Can can the base be zero?

345
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,420
That's an interesting question okay?

346
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,980
Can the base of a logarithm be zero?

347
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,816
Well in terms of our triangle we might think of that as saying You know zero to 

348
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:38,746
some kind of power X is equal to some other value Y Right this is something that 

349
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:44,383
we could write either by saying zero to the X equals Y Or we could write the 

350
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:50,240
same thing by saying log base zero of Y Is equal to X zero to the what equals X?

351
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,940
Now the issue here is that zero to anything ends up being zero right so?

352
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:03,220
If we're just going to be thinking of log base zero of Y for any other input Y.

353
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,819
You know you want to input something like one or two or pi Anything you might 

354
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:16,140
want you're asking the question zero to the what is equal to one or two or pi?

355
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,761
Or whatever number you might have there, and there's just not going 

356
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:25,000
to be an answer so at best You could try to say oh yes log of zero.

357
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,732
It's a perfectly valid function It's only defined on the input zero, 

358
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:31,960
but even then you'd have trouble Trying to finagle what you 

359
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,920
want there because saying zero to the what equals zero.

360
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,965
It's like anything anything applies to it So your arm is going to be twisted 

361
00:45:39,965 --> 00:45:44,660
behind your back However you want to make that work and it corresponds to 

362
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,354
the fact that the exponential function with base zero Is entirely zero it 

363
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:54,240
doesn't it doesn't map numbers in a nice one-to-one fashion on to each other?

364
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,468
So that's a great question can you have a log base zero now back to 

365
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:03,683
the idea of where these things come up in the real world One one 

366
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:08,027
example I kind of like is the Richter scale for earthquakes so the 

367
00:46:08,027 --> 00:46:13,020
Richter scale Gives us a quantification for how strong an earthquake is okay?

368
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,600
And it can be anything from very small numbers up to very large 

369
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,285
numbers like I think the largest earthquake ever measured And this 

370
00:46:20,285 --> 00:46:24,080
is just a chart that comes from Wikipedia was a nine point five okay?

371
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,123
And to appreciate just how insane that is it's worth looking at the relationship 

372
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:34,007
between What these numbers mean and then something like the equivalent amount of 

373
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:38,830
TNT some sort of measure of how much energy there is in it And then what we can 

374
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,774
try to do here is see if we can get an expression for the Richter scale number in 

375
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:49,140
terms of the amount of energy and Why logarithms would be a natural way to describe this?

376
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,060
So the key to focus on is as we're taking steps forward how much do things increase?

377
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:58,520
So for example if we go from two Well in this case it doesn't show us where 

378
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,339
three is so maybe we think of Taking a step from two up to four which is kind 

379
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:06,060
of like taking two steps What does that do in terms of the amount of energy?

380
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,363
Well it looks like it takes us from one metric ton of TNT Which is I guess a 

381
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:16,107
large bomb from World War two and it takes us up to a kiloton a thousand times 

382
00:47:16,107 --> 00:47:20,972
as much Okay Which is a small a small atom bomb so just two steps on the Richter 

383
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:25,656
scale Going from an earthquake of magnitude two to an earthquake of magnitude 

384
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:30,340
four takes us from large bomb from World War two Up to the nuclear age, right?

385
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,397
so that is noteworthy and The first clean step that we get is going from four 

386
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:40,276
to five at least in terms of what this chart is nicely showing us And evidently 

387
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:44,911
a single step up from four to five Corresponds to going from one kiloton to 

388
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:49,608
32 kilotons And that was evidently the size of the city destroying bomb that 

389
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:54,426
land on Nagasaki So this is maybe one thing that can be counterintuitive about 

390
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:59,122
logarithmic scales if you're just hearing in the news the difference between 

391
00:47:59,122 --> 00:48:03,880
oh there Was an earthquake that was a 4.0 versus an earthquake that was a 5.0.

392
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,995
It's easy to think yeah four and five Those are pretty similar numbers But evidently 

393
00:48:08,995 --> 00:48:14,110
in terms of TNT amounts that corresponds to multiplying by 32 to get from one to the 

394
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:19,166
next And going from two to four was evidently multiplying by about a thousand okay, 

395
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:24,341
and the only reason that's bigger is because here our chart wasn't showing what three 

396
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:29,336
was so we were taking two steps and You can verify for yourself that if you take a 

397
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:34,271
step of 32, and then you multiply by another 32 That's actually pretty close to a 

398
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:38,905
thousand So the idea that additive steps on the Richter number correspond to 

399
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:44,141
multiplicative steps in the TNT Seems to suggest that something logarithmic is at play 

400
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:49,316
here, and it's a little interesting to just keep going here and say How how much does 

401
00:48:49,316 --> 00:48:50,340
this grow partly?

402
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Because of the the world phenomena.

403
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,980
It's describing.

404
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,465
Yes, not a huge surprise that as we take another step It's 

405
00:48:58,465 --> 00:49:03,520
multiplying by about 32 again But raining that in to our intuitions.

406
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,030
That's the difference between 32 kilotons a small atom bomb And then one megaton 

407
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:14,353
which we might think of as not small atom bomb Nagasaki atom bomb Which I guess 

408
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:19,743
is 32 of the Nagasaki atom bombs For one megaton that is evidently the magnitude 

409
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:25,400
of the double string flat earthquake in Nevada, USA 1994 I didn't know what that was.

410
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,952
Thanks Wikipedia in terms of frequencies by the way I Also looked these up 

411
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:34,626
evidently ones that are less than two those happen all the time There's like 

412
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:39,421
8,000 of those per day, but as soon as we're in the realm of atom bombs things 

413
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:44,460
like 3.5 and 4 Those evidently also happen quite frequently somewhere on the earth.

414
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,794
There's around 134 of those happening somewhere every day who knew But as we get even 

415
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:55,314
more intense into this 5 and 6 range which you know we're well above the atom bomb scale 

416
00:49:55,314 --> 00:50:00,710
now we're only merely at around 2 per day and You know I'm sure that a geologist could 

417
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:06,044
come in and explain why we all shouldn't be super worried about the fact that there's 

418
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:10,944
two atom bomb equivalent Disruptions to the Earth's crust happening every day, 

419
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:16,526
but presumably it's particularly rare for those to be concentrated on some Some spot like 

420
00:50:16,526 --> 00:50:21,923
a city where what lots of people live Now just verifying that I thought that each step 

421
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:27,319
involves a growth of 32 Let's look at what the step from 6 up to 7 looks like and here 

422
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:32,591
It's giving us lots more examples in between maybe giving the illusion that that's a 

423
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:37,987
bigger step than it actually is and indeed That's the difference between 1 megaton and 

424
00:50:37,987 --> 00:50:43,383
32 megatons, so that's multiplying by 32 One of the things I found most interesting on 

425
00:50:43,383 --> 00:50:48,655
this chart by the way was Look at how far we have to go before we get to the largest 

426
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:54,176
nuclear weapon that's ever actually been Tested This was height of the Cold War the Tsar 

427
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:59,634
bomb That was 50 megatons, and I believe they actually had original plans to have a 100 

428
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:05,154
megaton bomb but talked themselves down from that 50 megatons we're talking start off at 

429
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:10,736
that 32 kilotons of the Nagasaki bomb Multiply by 32 to get a megaton multiply by another 

430
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:16,319
32 Right so we're talking about a thousand times the strength of the World War two ending 

431
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,901
explosion And you're still not at the 50 megatons of what humanity is capable of And that 

432
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:27,297
is evidently you know the Java earthquake of Indonesia so 7.0 is not just a little bit 

433
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,290
bigger than 6.0.

434
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,230
It's a lot bigger and The point here of course is just that when you have a scale giving 

435
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:37,854
you multiplicative increases It's worth appreciating that what look like small steps 

436
00:51:37,854 --> 00:51:42,695
Can actually be huge steps in terms of the energy implied or the absolute values implied 

437
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:47,264
here So it I mean when we're thinking about the fact that there was ever a 9.5 That 

438
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:51,887
actually seems absurd given that it's only in the 7.0 range that we're talking about 

439
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:56,619
the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out And this is indicative of one area where 

440
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:01,188
logarithms tend to come about it's When humans want to create a scale for something 

441
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:05,757
that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be So in the case of 

442
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:10,489
size of earthquakes you can have things from what happens Just all the time around the 

443
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:14,895
earth the size of a large hand grenade And you want that to be on your scale and 

444
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:19,682
something to think about ranging all the way up to you know the largest disruption that 

445
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:24,305
we've Seen in human history right and in order to have that in a way that you're not 

446
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:29,091
just Writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case and a whole 

447
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:33,878
bunch of different a smaller number of digits For your number in another case It's nice 

448
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:38,719
to take logarithms And then just put that on a single scale that basically puts squishes 

449
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:43,505
those numbers between 0 and 10 You see something very similar going on with the decibel 

450
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:48,183
scale for music that one actually Works a little bit differently where every time you 

451
00:52:48,183 --> 00:52:52,752
take a step up of 10 decibels that corresponds to multi multiplying by 10 So rather 

452
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:57,539
than a step of 1 multiplying by 10 It's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10 so that kind 

453
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:02,108
of makes the math of it a little bit screwy But the idea is the same that if you're 

454
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:06,840
listening to a sound that's 50 decibels for 60 decibels It's a lot quieter in terms of 

455
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,463
the energy being transmitted and going from you know What would it be 60 to 70 or 70 

456
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:11,790
to 80?

457
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:18,130
Those steps you know from 60 up to 80 that involves multiplying the amount of energy per 

458
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:23,290
square area By a factor of 100 so every time you see a logarithmic scale Know in your 

459
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:28,450
mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount 

460
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,609
This is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus 

461
00:53:33,609 --> 00:53:39,010
outbreak so How might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the 

462
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,430
Richter scale number by 1 you're multiplying by 32 Well, 

463
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,190
we could think in terms of a log with base 32.

464
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:54,330
I Could say if I take the log of I'm just gonna call our the number for the Richter scale.

465
00:53:54,710 --> 00:54:01,430
I might think of this as log base 32 and That's going to correspond to No, no, 

466
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:07,894
no, I'm doing this wrong That's not the thing that's logged We take the log 

467
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:14,359
base 32 of the big number of the the TNT number something that was like You 

468
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:20,739
know one Gigaton or one megaton It's one million Tons The log base 32 that 

469
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:27,970
should correspond to the Richter scale number But there might be some kind of offset.

470
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,835
So we might say that there's some kind of Constant s that 

471
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,583
we're adding to this Richter scale number and this expression 

472
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:39,270
is exactly the same Excuse me for going off the bottom there.

473
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:45,180
This expression is exactly the same as saying 32 to the power of some offset times our 

474
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,762
Richter scale number, which is the same as taking you know 32 to that offset which 

475
00:54:50,762 --> 00:54:56,344
itself is just some big constant times 32 to the Richter scale number so you might 

476
00:54:56,344 --> 00:55:02,128
think of this as just being some constant Times 32 to the power of the number you see 

477
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:07,912
So this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it that if this 

478
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:13,762
is what corresponds to the TNT amount that you see as You increase that R step by step 

479
00:55:13,762 --> 00:55:19,412
you're multiplying by 32 But another way of communicating the exact same fact is to 

480
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:25,128
take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is Alright now the next thing I want to 

481
00:55:25,128 --> 00:55:30,979
talk about is how we don't always have to Worry about how to compute logs of different 

482
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:36,830
bases and it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32 I referenced 

483
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:42,546
earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e computer scientists 

484
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:48,263
really like to have a log with base 2 and it turns out for Computational purposes or 

485
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:53,912
for also thinking about how these things grow if you have one Log if you're able to 

486
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:59,561
compute one type of log whether that's base 10 base 2 base e you can compute pretty 

487
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:05,143
much anything else That you want Okay now to get our intuitions in that direction, 

488
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:11,128
let's turn back to our quiz and go to the next question and I believe that this question 

489
00:56:11,128 --> 00:56:12,810
is the most I don't know.

490
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,470
This is this is a halfway reasonable question.

491
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:20,340
This should be nice This is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2 

492
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:26,025
contexts to base 10 contexts and it's also a good intuition for understanding powers 

493
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:31,643
of 2 to have in general The relationship that it has with powers of 10 because it's 

494
00:56:31,643 --> 00:56:36,391
this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that these two sort of Well, 

495
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:37,930
you'll see what I mean.

496
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:44,532
They play nicely with each other So a question asks given the fact that 2 to the 10th 

497
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:49,187
is 10 24 a thousand and 24 which is approximately 1000 okay, 

498
00:56:49,187 --> 00:56:55,826
so you can if you're being a little bit loose with your numbers and you're just making 

499
00:56:55,826 --> 00:57:02,465
approximations 2 to the 10th Basically a thousand which of the following is closest to 

500
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:09,257
being true Log base 2 of 10 is approximately 0.3 Log base 2 of 10 is approximately sorry 

501
00:57:09,257 --> 00:57:15,895
log base 10 of 2 is approximately 0.3 Log base 2 of 10 is approximately 1 third or log 

502
00:57:15,895 --> 00:57:22,687
base 10 of 2 is approximately 1 third Hey, which of these is closest to being true based 

503
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:29,326
on the fact that 2 to the 10th is essentially a thousand I'll give you a little moment 

504
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:36,041
for that You Interesting that we've got kind of a split on this one so I'm wondering if 

505
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:42,756
they're gonna be numerically pretty similar or if they're gonna be conceptually similar 

506
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:49,395
Or if there's even a difference between those two So since answers keep rolling in I'm 

507
00:57:49,395 --> 00:57:55,958
gonna give this give this a little bit more time so anyone at home watching Hopefully 

508
00:57:55,958 --> 00:58:02,521
you already have a pencil and paper out to be noodling through these yourself That is 

509
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:09,160
the spirit of the lectures that we're doing If you don't now is the time to take out a 

510
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:15,875
pencil and paper and See if you can think this one through and write it out some of the 

511
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:22,590
problems that we're gonna build to here Definitely will require pencil and paper so now 

512
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:29,077
is as good a time as any and if you're watching this in the future even if You can't 

513
00:58:29,077 --> 00:58:31,290
participate in the live poll.

514
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:46,050
I really do think it's a lot of fun to Kind of throw your own hat into the mix even 

515
00:58:46,050 --> 00:59:00,420
if it's not going to contribute to one of the numbers That you see growing on the 

516
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:14,614
screen I'll give you a little bit more time here as the answers seem to continue 

517
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:29,334
rolling in You You Okay, so I'll go ahead and grade it now and Let's see how people 

518
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:43,529
did on this one So the correct answer is B Which is that the log base 10 of 2 is 

519
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:58,775
approximately 0.3 and it looks like 1850 of you correctly got that so congratulations, 

520
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:12,970
but the close contender not at all a Unanimous decision here looks like it was D.

521
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,343
Which is that the log base 10 of 2 is around 1 third so that's good They're very 

522
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:23,563
numerically similar right that It's either 0.3 or around 1 third which is 0.3 3 3 3 

523
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:28,162
repeating But the question was asking which one is closest to being true, 

524
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:33,506
and let's see how we can think about this so It points out that you have a power of 2 

525
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:38,912
which is 1024 awfully close to a power of 10 about 10 cubed and the question is how we 

526
01:00:38,912 --> 01:00:44,319
can leverage this to understand something like Log base 2 of 10 or log base 10 of 2 as 

527
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,663
we saw earlier those are just the reciprocals of each other So what does this mean if 

528
01:00:49,663 --> 01:00:51,590
log base 2 of 10 is equal to X?

529
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:56,070
That's the same thing as saying 2 to the X is equal to 10 right.

530
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:00,864
It's asking us 2 to the what equals 10 So what we have here is an 

531
01:01:00,864 --> 01:01:05,949
expression 10 cubed is approximately equal to 2 to the 10th so what I 

532
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:11,470
might write out is we know that 2 to the 10th Instead of writing it as a 10.

533
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:16,072
I'm going to write that 10 as 2 to the X Where X is the 

534
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:20,590
number such that 2 to the X is approximate is equal to 10?

535
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:25,963
So if that cubed is the same as 2 to the 10th This is I'll just write out 

536
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:30,457
the full details the same as saying 2 to the 3 X is equal to 2 to the 10th 

537
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:33,452
and Exponentiation is a nice one-to-one function, 

538
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:37,886
so it's okay to just Say whatever is going on in the input if the outputs 

539
01:01:37,886 --> 01:01:42,379
are the same the inputs must also be the same You can't do that with every 

540
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:46,992
function people seem to think you can do that with any function But you just 

541
01:01:46,992 --> 01:01:49,030
can't and what that means is that?

542
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:58,800
X is about X is about 10 thirds, okay which Ah Great so log base 2 of 10 is about 10 

543
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:07,330
thirds, so if we looked at our answers though That's not actually any of the options.

544
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:13,607
We've got various things asking log base 2 of 10 being around 0.3 or 1 third so it 

545
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:20,262
looks like instead we should try to re-express this as log base 10 of 2 and Well enough 

546
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:26,917
what we saw earlier is that log base 2 of 10 we could also say log base 10 of 2 is Just 

547
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:33,346
1 over that amount 1 over X and you can see this pretty easily by writing 2 is equal 

548
01:02:33,346 --> 01:02:40,001
to 10 to the 1 over X if we're asking 10 to the what equals 2 the answer is 1 over what 

549
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:46,430
we just got there, so Log base 10 of 2 is 1 divided by this amount Which is 3 tenths?

550
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:50,941
Which is 0.3 great So this is kind of a nice constant to think 

551
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:55,452
about because there's this wonderful pattern that happens when 

552
01:02:55,452 --> 01:03:00,250
we're looking at powers of 2 so if I ask What is the log base 2 of?

553
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:06,752
1,000 Like we just saw it's approximately the case that 2 to the power 10 Is equal 

554
01:03:06,752 --> 01:03:12,011
to a thousand and because we're doing things at logs I'm just going to be writing 

555
01:03:12,011 --> 01:03:17,205
it in that way a log 2 of a thousand is approximately 10 Similarly log base 2 of 

556
01:03:17,205 --> 01:03:22,271
a million Well, let's see if we have to multiply 2 by itself about 10 times to 

557
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:27,466
get to a thousand we should have to multiply it by itself around 20 times to get 

558
01:03:27,466 --> 01:03:32,468
up to a million and Indeed log base 2 of a million is approximately 20 It's a 

559
01:03:32,468 --> 01:03:37,726
little bit smaller, but this is kind of a nice approximation to have in your mind 

560
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:42,728
And then similarly you'll see why I'm writing out this as a pattern in just a 

561
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:47,666
moment if we wanted to go up to a billion Saying how many times do I have to 

562
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:53,117
multiply 2 by itself to get to a billion This is about 30 And any computer scientist 

563
01:03:53,117 --> 01:03:58,312
out there who's thought about you know just how much as a kilobyte or a megabyte 

564
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,210
or a gigabyte?

565
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:04,333
They'll be familiar with the idea that Powers of 2 are nice and close to 

566
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:09,307
these powers of 10 or more specifically powers of a thousand now What I 

567
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:14,350
want to do is just write all of the same things with log base 10 Not not 

568
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:19,670
approximately equal to this is actually equal to 3 log base 10 of a thousand.

569
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:25,268
It's equal to 3 Log base 10 well you tell me what's log base 10 of a million It's 

570
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:30,651
counting the number of zeros it ends up being about 6 and log base 10 of a billion 

571
01:04:30,651 --> 01:04:36,358
Counting the number of zeros it ends up being 9 Now the reason I wanted to write all of 

572
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:41,936
this out is to just emphasize an interesting pattern here Which is we're just growing 

573
01:04:41,936 --> 01:04:47,513
by these increments right as we go from a thousand to a million to a billion with log 

574
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:53,026
base 2 We're stepping up by steps of 10 But when we're playing the same game with 10 

575
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:58,798
we're stepping up by these increments of 3 So there's this nice relationship and in fact 

576
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:04,636
for all of them to go from log base 2 to log base 10 It seems like we're just multiplying 

577
01:05:04,636 --> 01:05:05,090
by 0.3.

578
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:11,076
So 10 times 0.3 is 3 20 we scale down by that same amount 30 we 

579
01:05:11,076 --> 01:05:16,649
scale down by that same amount Okay now this is an intuition 

580
01:05:16,649 --> 01:05:22,770
worth remembering if you have Your numbers described with one base.

581
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,663
It's basically the same as describing them with another base, 

582
01:05:26,663 --> 01:05:31,306
but there's some rescaling constant Okay, and then the next question is going to 

583
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:36,005
start getting us at that direction But it's going to be framed in a way that just 

584
01:05:36,005 --> 01:05:40,476
looks like a whole pile of algebra And again, I will encourage you to plug in 

585
01:05:40,476 --> 01:05:45,118
numbers if you want to to gain a little intuition for it So as our third to last 

586
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:49,761
question, this will be a long lecture We have which of the following is true and 

587
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:54,403
then just a whole pile of Various possible ways to combine log base C of B times 

588
01:05:54,403 --> 01:05:58,874
log base C of A Does that equal log base B log base B of A and rather than me 

589
01:05:58,874 --> 01:06:00,250
reading them out to you?

590
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:07,138
I'll just let you look through them plug in some numbers I'll give you I'll 

591
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:13,600
give you a meaningful time on this one because it's not it's not obvious 

592
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:20,594
unless you're already familiar with logarithms and It's worth thinking through 

593
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:27,322
a little bit You We have an outstanding question from the audience Which is 

594
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:34,050
does the bar length of the pole use some kind of log function and healthily?

595
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:40,187
It looks like Ben Eater has gone ahead and directly answered in the form of the code 

596
01:06:40,187 --> 01:06:45,664
involved where the chart max is mapped up is the raising 2 to the power of a Ceiling 

597
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:51,013
of a log base 2 of the maximum attempt count which I think is to say unraveling If 

598
01:06:51,013 --> 01:06:56,619
you're looking at the maximum number I'm not I'm not great at Vanna whiting this thing 

599
01:06:56,619 --> 01:07:02,290
if you look at the maximum number in our poll It's asking what's the log base 2 of that?

600
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:13,539
so as it crosses different powers of 2 then that rescales it and Yes, 

601
01:07:13,539 --> 01:07:25,952
yes is the answer what a fantastically apropos question Thank You Karen All right, 

602
01:07:25,952 --> 01:07:37,917
so answers are still rolling in and I think like I said I just want to give you 

603
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:50,331
some more time to think this through because it's looks like a big pile of algebra 

604
01:07:50,331 --> 01:08:02,595
plug in some numbers to see what seems to work well and See which answer fits You 

605
01:08:02,595 --> 01:08:14,560
You You Okay, so even if you are still thinking about it I'm gonna go ahead and 

606
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:27,273
grade it here and then start talking about Why it's true and then also why we should 

607
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:39,986
care why this is an operation that actually tells us something so the correct answer 

608
01:08:39,986 --> 01:08:52,549
which it looks like around 1700 of you got congratulations is Log base C of B times 

609
01:08:52,549 --> 01:09:06,010
log base B of A is equal to log base C of A great Now that's just a big ol pile of things.

610
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:07,210
Why would that be true?

611
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,390
How do we think about it?

612
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,468
Now phase one, like I said, we might plug in an example, 

613
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:14,330
but let's try to actually think about why the example holds.

614
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:20,237
So let me Pull out we've got this as one more of the log rules This is just 

615
01:09:20,237 --> 01:09:25,562
repeating the end what the correct answer turned out to be where we've got an 

616
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:30,954
expression for Log base C of B log base B of A and this ends up being log base 

617
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:36,415
C of A It's gotten rid of the B's which is kind of interesting so Some examples 

618
01:09:36,415 --> 01:09:41,330
you might plug in here would be things like let's use a different color.

619
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:46,770
Let's use green Instead of C.

620
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:52,251
I'm gonna go ahead and plug in 10 Log base 10 of 100 which is kind of asking 

621
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:57,601
how many times does 10 go into a 100 in a multiplicative sense how many times 

622
01:09:57,601 --> 01:10:03,020
do I multiply 10 by itself to get to 100 where the answer is 2 and then log of 

623
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,438
100 of Let's plug in another power of 10 It'll be nice if it's also a power of 

624
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:13,788
100 So I'll do a million So This one is asking 10 to 100 to the what equals a 

625
01:10:13,788 --> 01:10:19,070
million How many times do I multiply a hundred by itself to get to a million?

626
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,410
How many times does a hundred go into a million?

627
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:27,519
Phrasing the same thing 10 different ways now the claim is that this is 

628
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:32,840
the same thing as taking log base 10 of a million That if I ask how many 

629
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:38,090
times does 10 go into 100 and how many times does 100 go into a million?

630
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:44,688
Multiplying those should give me the answer to how many times 10 goes into a million 

631
01:10:44,688 --> 01:10:51,209
now just checking the numbers this certainly works 10 goes into a hundred two times 

632
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:57,419
100 goes into a million three times in a multiplicative sense in that a hundred 

633
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:03,630
cubed is equal to a million and Indeed how many times does 10 go into a million?

634
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:09,301
well six Now we could think of this property in terms of the corresponding 

635
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:14,077
exponent rule which is going to look a little bit stranger But it's actually 

636
01:11:14,077 --> 01:11:18,853
just saying the entirely the same thing So here we're if we have a base of C 

637
01:11:18,853 --> 01:11:24,001
and a base of B And we're trying to relate those to each other the whole statement 

638
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:29,150
is equal to saying that um suppose that B to the X is equal to a Got some number B.

639
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,768
You raise it to some number X and equals a suppose 

640
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:34,010
It's also the case that C to the Y equals B.

641
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:39,067
Those two together are the same as saying C to the XY equals a Now that's kind 

642
01:11:39,067 --> 01:11:43,782
of a mouthful to say out loud But if you plug in some numbers to translate what 

643
01:11:43,782 --> 01:11:48,381
all of that is really saying in the context of the example we just did Saying 

644
01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:52,979
if you can write a hundred is ten squared and if you can write a million as a 

645
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:57,812
hundred cubed Well that lets you write a million in terms of a power of ten Okay, 

646
01:11:57,812 --> 01:12:02,470
so sort of asking this question How many times does one number go into another?

647
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:09,072
But letting you layer it on top of each other Now if we rearrange that expression we get 

648
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:14,615
what is probably the second most important of all of our log rules The most important is 

649
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:20,034
this top one that when you multiply the inputs you add the outputs But the second most 

650
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:25,577
important which is known as the change of base formula Lets us rate that if you want the 

651
01:12:25,577 --> 01:12:31,058
log base B of some value a Then for whatever C you want it doesn't actually matter what 

652
01:12:31,058 --> 01:12:36,663
log you have in your pocket if you use that other log And you take the log C of a divided 

653
01:12:36,663 --> 01:12:40,088
by the log C of B that gives you log base B of a Okay, 

654
01:12:40,088 --> 01:12:45,631
so just as an example here what this would look like is let's say I wanted to be able to 

655
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:51,174
compute log base 100 of things I just really want to it's not a button on my calculator, 

656
01:12:51,174 --> 01:12:56,717
but I would love to be able to do it and I want to do it in With an input like a million 

657
01:12:56,717 --> 01:13:02,198
well even if I don't have the log base 100 button on my calculator what I can do is say 

658
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:07,554
I'll use the log base 10 button and Evaluate what's on the inside here which at least 

659
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:13,035
positionally it's kind of above the 100 it has a higher altitude as we write it so This 

660
01:13:13,035 --> 01:13:18,266
can line up with the notation a little bit that it sits on the numerator and on the 

661
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:23,685
bottom I use the log base 10 button that's in my calculator on the base on the 100 and 

662
01:13:23,685 --> 01:13:29,166
Then I can evaluate both of those and it'll give me the answer in this case it gets you 

663
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:34,584
6 divided by 2 which will be 3 and If we really just think through what this is saying 

664
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:40,189
I know I've said it many different times But it's a it's a convoluted enough way to write 

665
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:45,359
things but an intuitive enough fact that I think just coming at it from a bunch of 

666
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:50,777
different angles can be important because like I said This is probably the second most 

667
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:55,697
important log rule We're asking how many times does 100 go into a million in a 

668
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:59,310
multiplicative sense how many times we multiply by itself?

669
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:03,090
But division is asking that same question in an additive 

670
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:06,550
sense if I say how many times does the log of 100 go into the?

671
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,773
Log of a million that's what division means it's saying how many 

672
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:12,830
times do I add this bottom number to itself to get to the top?

673
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:17,748
But anything additive in the logarithm realm is the same as anything multiplicative 

674
01:14:17,748 --> 01:14:21,609
in terms of what's inside the parentheses So both of the left-handed side and 

675
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:25,470
the right-hand side are just saying how many times does 100 go into a million?

676
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:29,815
But going about that in different ways So this is extremely nice because it 

677
01:14:29,815 --> 01:14:34,081
actually lets us compute things next time we're going to talk all about the 

678
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:38,458
natural logarithm, which is log base e often written ln and Turns out this is 

679
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:43,004
much easier to compute There's nice math behind it such that if you want to come 

680
01:14:43,004 --> 01:14:47,494
up with an algorithm that your calculator can use It's actually a lot easier to 

681
01:14:47,494 --> 01:14:52,490
think of log base e of numbers So anytime that you need to go to some kind of calculator.

682
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:57,861
I don't know let's say we popped over to something like Desmos Always happy to have 

683
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:03,255
as a friend, and you wanted to compute log base 10 of Some number you know let's say 

684
01:15:03,255 --> 01:15:08,650
we're doing log base 10 of 57 and it looks like that's you know it should make sense.

685
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:14,510
It's between 1 and 2 because 57 was between 10 and 100 What's going on under the hood?

686
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,110
How is it actually figuring this out?

687
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:20,564
It's going to use somewhere in there a change of base formula Which is going 

688
01:15:20,564 --> 01:15:25,077
to be that the natural log of 57 divided by the natural log of 10 is the same 

689
01:15:25,077 --> 01:15:29,590
thing These are two different ways of writing it so if you know one logarithm.

690
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:32,443
You know all of the logarithms okay, and Well, 

691
01:15:32,443 --> 01:15:37,724
let's just use that fact to answer one more of our quiz questions And this will be the 

692
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:43,188
second to last quiz question, so thank you all for sticking it through I think we will be 

693
01:15:43,188 --> 01:15:48,652
I Think you'll be pleased by the last question because the last question will actually be 

694
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:54,055
like a fun Problem-solving puzzle II thing and it'll involve a lot of what we've used up 

695
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:59,336
to this point kind of a culminating thing So before that though just to make sure that 

696
01:15:59,336 --> 01:16:02,190
we've got the instincts of Change of base down.

697
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,670
What do we have?

698
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:08,838
Use the approximation that log base 2 of 10 is around 10 thirds so 

699
01:16:08,838 --> 01:16:13,570
using that approximation Which of the following is approximately true?

700
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,768
Log base 2 of X is about 10 thirds of log base 10 of X Log base 2 of X is log 

701
01:16:18,768 --> 01:16:23,966
base 10 of 10 thirds of X log base 2 of X is log base 10 of X to the power 10 

702
01:16:23,966 --> 01:16:29,164
thirds or Log base 2 of X is 10 thirds times the log base 10 of X and finally 

703
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:34,429
none of the above So I'll give you a moment to think about that you might want 

704
01:16:34,429 --> 01:16:39,693
to think to the chart that we were drawing earlier and thinking about log base 

705
01:16:39,693 --> 01:16:44,691
2 and log base 10 as we're looking at powers of 1000 and how each of those 

706
01:16:44,691 --> 01:16:49,890
grows that can leverage some of The intuition but I'll let you think about it.

707
01:16:50,030 --> 01:17:03,164
Stop talking You While answers are rolling in it looks like a number of 

708
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:17,028
people have been asking on Twitter about Basically how complex numbers play 

709
01:17:17,028 --> 01:17:30,710
into this so you know we've got Jamil asking What if the base is imaginary?

710
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,728
We've got Kelcon asking what about complex bases since e to the X is walking around 

711
01:17:35,728 --> 01:17:40,419
the spiral wouldn't it hit every complex number Well it won't hit every complex number, 

712
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:44,845
but your instinct that it's hitting multiple things is pretty spot-on Doesn't make 

713
01:17:44,845 --> 01:17:49,430
sense to talk about logs with imaginary numbers by Nitya so to all of these questions.

714
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:53,886
It's actually a very Nuanced question the short answer is yes 

715
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:58,270
complex logarithms absolutely exist But each one of them has 

716
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:02,870
multiple different outputs so a good a good analogy here is how?

717
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:08,056
If we have the square root function if I ask something like the square root of 

718
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:12,558
5 You know we have the convention that you always do the positive amount, 

719
01:18:12,558 --> 01:18:17,425
but that doesn't quite feel honest It feels like the right answer is to specify 

720
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:22,171
that there's two different outputs for the square root function two solutions 

721
01:18:22,171 --> 01:18:26,794
to x squared equals 25 And this is actually true in complex numbers as well 

722
01:18:26,794 --> 01:18:31,601
one of the things we talked about in a complex number lecture Was that you can 

723
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:36,590
take the square root of I and you actually get root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I?

724
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:41,277
But that there's two solutions you can do plus or minus this value and so you could 

725
01:18:41,277 --> 01:18:44,179
say that the square root function Isn't a function, 

726
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:48,812
but it's a multi-valued function It always has two different outputs now something 

727
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:53,276
funky happens when we have exponents at play So if you're just like someone who 

728
01:18:53,276 --> 01:18:55,230
hasn't seen this stuff don't worry.

729
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:58,851
We talked about it in previous lectures I'm obviously jumping around on the 

730
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:02,234
complexity level a lot here where if in lecture 5 I'm talking about Like 

731
01:19:02,234 --> 01:19:05,802
Euler's formula with complex numbers and compound interest and like how that 

732
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:09,370
plays into physics and then lecture 6 We're back to the basics of logarithms.

733
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:16,020
I acknowledge that might be a little bit jarring to potential audience members, 

734
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:23,142
but just continuing on with the answer if you note that e to the 2 pi times you know some 

735
01:19:23,142 --> 01:19:29,869
number times I This basically walks you around a circle so that the output will Walk 

736
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:36,753
around a circle and just keep repeating as n goes from 0 up to 1 It'll walk around one 

737
01:19:36,753 --> 01:19:43,638
cycle and end up back where you started as n goes from 1 to 2 You'll end up back where 

738
01:19:43,638 --> 01:19:50,602
you started so for example e to the 0 sits here e to the I pi Is at negative 1 but e to 

739
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:51,710
the 2 pi I is?

740
01:19:53,030 --> 01:20:02,196
also at 1 same with Excuse me same with e to the 4 pi I that also Equals 1 

741
01:20:02,196 --> 01:20:11,730
so in general if you wanted to ask something like what is the log base e of 1?

742
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:18,123
You know on the one hand we want to say the log of Log base anything of 1 should 

743
01:20:18,123 --> 01:20:23,291
be 0 because anything to the power 0 equals that 1 But if we're letting complex 

744
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:28,589
numbers into the mix you would have to honestly say well 2 pi I is another pretty 

745
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:33,822
good answer to this question because e to the 2 pi I also equals 1 and Same with 

746
01:20:33,822 --> 01:20:39,055
4 pi I and you could even go in the negative direction and in general n times pi 

747
01:20:39,055 --> 01:20:44,353
Times 2 times I kind of wrote that in a weird order for any integer in Feels like 

748
01:20:44,353 --> 01:20:49,521
a valid answer to this question So there's a couple ways that you can deal with 

749
01:20:49,521 --> 01:20:54,690
that in math and before we get back to our usual lesson Just on logarithm rules.

750
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:55,670
This is interesting enough.

751
01:20:55,670 --> 01:21:01,160
I kind of want to pull it up Let's see what if we have complex logarithm 

752
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:06,349
uh Great Wikipedia always to our aid probably it'll have a nice like 

753
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:11,990
visual of some kind for us look such fancy color diagrams What I want okay.

754
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,230
This is what I want wonderful.

755
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:19,484
Let's zoom out a little bit Great, so there's this notion of what's called a Riemann 

756
01:21:19,484 --> 01:21:24,668
surface That's basically trying to capture the idea that you have a function with 

757
01:21:24,668 --> 01:21:30,043
multiple outputs and intuitively Maybe you can understand what it's getting at where 

758
01:21:30,043 --> 01:21:35,607
the input would be something on the XY plane and the output There's just many different 

759
01:21:35,607 --> 01:21:41,234
outputs sitting there so when you have a complex logarithm you have to account for that, 

760
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:46,861
but it's used It's actually a very useful idea To do but it takes a lot more nuance than 

761
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:52,552
than you might expect So with all of that hopefully that helped At least partially answer 

762
01:21:52,552 --> 01:21:57,863
some of people's questions same same by the way with Logarithms with based negative 

763
01:21:57,863 --> 01:22:03,300
numbers because if you're asking like negative 1 to the X and really noodling on what 

764
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:07,283
that means it's It gets you into the realm of Complex numbers, 

765
01:22:07,283 --> 01:22:12,784
so you have to deal with the same multiple output idea now answers are rolling in more 

766
01:22:12,784 --> 01:22:18,158
slowly so this seems like a fine time to grade things and the answer turns out to be 

767
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:23,849
You rescale it if you want to go from log base 2 of something to log base 10 of something 

768
01:22:23,849 --> 01:22:29,413
It involves rescaling and one way you could think about this is with the change of base 

769
01:22:29,413 --> 01:22:34,914
formula, so let's say we have Let's get rid of our e stuff Let's say you have Log base 

770
01:22:34,914 --> 01:22:40,351
2 of X, but we want to write it in terms of log base 10 We can write that as log base 

771
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:45,409
10 of X Divided by log base 10 of 2 saying how many times does 2 go into X in a 

772
01:22:45,409 --> 01:22:50,973
multiplicative sense is The same as saying how many times does the log of 2 go into the 

773
01:22:50,973 --> 01:22:53,250
log of X in an additive sense, okay?

774
01:22:53,929 --> 01:22:58,710
And Well, what is 1 divided by the log base 10 of 2?

775
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:05,821
so we're going to keep our log base 10 of X out here and From what we found earlier 

776
01:23:05,821 --> 01:23:12,290
We found that log base 10 of 2 was approximately 3 tenths was approximately 0.3.

777
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:15,993
So when we divide by it that should get us 10 thirds Okay, 

778
01:23:15,993 --> 01:23:21,010
and this lines up with what we were looking at a little bit earlier with powers of 1000.

779
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:21,850
Let's see.

780
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:22,590
Where was it?

781
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:29,745
Great So when we're converting from log base 10 of something up to log base 2 You 

782
01:23:29,745 --> 01:23:34,120
know here we were thinking of multiplying the top by 0.3 to get to the bottom But 

783
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:38,334
you could also think of multiplying by 10 thirds to get to the top Anytime you 

784
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:42,549
have log base 10 of some number you just rescale it and you have log base 2 of 

785
01:23:42,549 --> 01:23:46,764
that number and the rescaling Constant comes from the log base 2 of 10 or vice 

786
01:23:46,764 --> 01:23:50,019
versa log base 10 of 2 So that's change of base like I said, 

787
01:23:50,019 --> 01:23:54,394
it's very important It lets you put everything into a nice universal language and 

788
01:23:54,394 --> 01:23:58,556
that should be all of the hint that you need for the last question Which is a 

789
01:23:58,556 --> 01:24:00,210
challenge question on this one.

790
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:02,930
So if anyone's been watching and they've been like I know logarithms.

791
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:07,739
I've got this completely down Let me pull up the last question which 

792
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:12,764
came up on let's see It's not the AMC, but it's whatever the predecessor 

793
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:17,651
to the AMC was I believe So it's you know, it's gonna involve a little 

794
01:24:17,651 --> 01:24:22,470
cleverness and manipulation We've got this long Sequence of fractions.

795
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:27,869
Okay, you take 1 divided by the log base 2 of a hundred factorial And remember 

796
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:33,343
100 factorial is a hundred times 99 times 98 on the way all the way down to 1 so 

797
01:24:33,343 --> 01:24:38,480
1 divided by the log base 2 of that plus 1 divided by the log base 3 of 100 

798
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:44,022
factorial Plus 1 divided by log base 4 of 100 factorial on and on and on up until 

799
01:24:44,022 --> 01:24:49,970
1 divided by the log base 100 of 100 factorial So this looks rather intimidating, right?

800
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:56,256
Certainly adding fractions is never fun adding 100 fractions seems even worse Dealing 

801
01:24:56,256 --> 01:25:01,240
with a bunch of logs of different bases seems like a pain and the factorial is playing 

802
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:06,110
into this So I'm just gonna give you you know, given that this is the wind down time.

803
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:23,427
I'm gonna give you Two or three minutes to start thinking about this and if you don't 

804
01:25:23,427 --> 01:25:37,724
get it, it's totally fine We're gonna walk through what the answer is, 

805
01:25:37,724 --> 01:25:55,243
but I'm just gonna let people think about this final challenge question before we call 

806
01:25:55,243 --> 01:26:12,560
it a day You You You You You So I'm gonna give you a little bit more time on this one 

807
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:30,079
because it's definitely It's definitely fun to work out and I think if you know how to 

808
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:47,597
start then great But if you don't know how to start just letting yourself kind of work 

809
01:26:47,597 --> 01:27:04,512
with a couple of the different rules that we've worked out before Change of base it 

810
01:27:04,512 --> 01:27:22,031
comes into play if you'd like to use that And just kind of keep manipulating and if it 

811
01:27:22,031 --> 01:27:39,952
feels like you're getting something that's a little too messy see if you come at it from 

812
01:27:39,952 --> 01:27:57,471
a different angle and Because answers are rolling in a little bit more slowly now What 

813
01:27:57,471 --> 01:28:14,587
I'm going to do is just start to describe the explanation here and then come back to 

814
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:20,830
grade it in just a moment here.

815
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:26,054
So the expression that we have Looks like I just started writing it out while you guys 

816
01:28:26,054 --> 01:28:30,858
were working on it one divided by log base two of a hundred factorial Plus one divided 

817
01:28:30,858 --> 01:28:35,552
by log base three of a hundred factorial and before you even start the fact that the 

818
01:28:35,552 --> 01:28:40,191
thing on the inside of The log involves a big product of stuff should actually feel 

819
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:44,885
good because logs like to take in things that look like products because of the most 

820
01:28:44,885 --> 01:28:49,690
important property that we have which Is the idea that it turns products into addition?

821
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:53,832
Okay, so right away, you know that you're probably going to use that second 

822
01:28:53,832 --> 01:28:57,309
thing You notice is that it's uncomfortable to have all of these different 

823
01:28:57,309 --> 01:29:00,553
bases log base 2 of something log base 3 of something log base 100 of 

824
01:29:00,553 --> 01:29:04,030
something so Translating it all into the common language should be helpful.

825
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,750
How does change of base work?

826
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:10,650
Well asking how many times does to go into a hundred factorial is the same as asking?

827
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:15,310
How many times does the log of to divide into the log of a hundred factorial?

828
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:21,710
It doesn't even matter what logarithm you use this log could be base 10 base e base 

829
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:27,457
2 doesn't matter this change of base formula Still holds now what that means for 

830
01:29:27,457 --> 01:29:33,205
our expression is instead of taking one divided by log base 2 of 100 factorial I 

831
01:29:33,205 --> 01:29:39,307
could write that as log of 2 Divided by so let me draw a little dividing line between 

832
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:45,410
what I'm doing here log of 2 divided by log of 100 factorial Okay, and then similarly?

833
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:52,658
log of 3 divided by log of 100 factorial so all I'm doing here is taking The reciprocal 

834
01:29:52,658 --> 01:29:59,079
so instead of taking log of 100 factorial over log of 2 I have inverted it log of 2 over 

835
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:05,500
100 factorial because that's what this reciprocal is doing so with that as the beginning 

836
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:11,993
I'm gonna go ahead and just grade this lock in the answers and See how see how everyone's 

837
01:30:11,993 --> 01:30:18,486
doing So it looks like awesome around 1796 we always we always draw a little bit north of 

838
01:30:18,486 --> 01:30:24,113
Ramanujan's number around 1800 of you Answered that it's one which is correct 

839
01:30:24,113 --> 01:30:30,534
congratulations 70 of you answered 100 which we can maybe see where where that our error 

840
01:30:30,534 --> 01:30:36,811
would have come from Those of you that answered zero that's interesting it would imply 

841
01:30:36,811 --> 01:30:42,943
that somehow you have cancellation at play Because these are all positive numbers so 

842
01:30:42,943 --> 01:30:49,292
thinking one of them was negative So you could probably gut check against the idea that 

843
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:55,713
it would be zero 41 of you want me to come up with a number fun numerical fact about 69, 

844
01:30:55,713 --> 01:30:59,104
but I won't 28 of you said 2 and I think yeah, 

845
01:30:59,104 --> 01:31:05,597
I think that's I Think the the difference between 1 and 100 maybe would be interesting to 

846
01:31:05,597 --> 01:31:11,441
try to analyze, but if we go back to our answer I Realize it may be a little bit 

847
01:31:11,441 --> 01:31:17,501
confusing how I've heard this this isn't this is not a big fraction this was just a 

848
01:31:17,501 --> 01:31:23,777
dividing line between Not true ironically trying not to confuse my fractions with each 

849
01:31:23,777 --> 01:31:30,270
other so rewriting our expression up on the top here as we add all of these things and we 

850
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:36,691
can continue up until log of 100 all divided by log of 100 factorial The key is that now 

851
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:42,968
all of the denominators are the same so we can add the numerators No more plus sign is 

852
01:31:42,968 --> 01:31:49,389
just going to equal something that top is going to look like log of 2 Plus log of 3 plus 

853
01:31:49,389 --> 01:31:55,810
on and on up to log of 100 all divided by the log of 100 factorial and it seems like the 

854
01:31:55,810 --> 01:32:02,303
only little contention among those answering the question is whether this should simplify 

855
01:32:02,303 --> 01:32:08,724
to be 1 or should it simplify to be a hundred and Really the way we can think about this 

856
01:32:08,724 --> 01:32:15,072
is to just break down that bottom part in terms of what a factorial means I'll go ahead 

857
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:20,772
and do this on the bottom part since I didn't manage my paper real estate very 

858
01:32:20,772 --> 01:32:27,121
effectively here the log of 100 times 99 times 98 on and on times 2 times 1 is the same 

859
01:32:27,121 --> 01:32:33,469
as adding all of them and You can probably see this mostly cancels out with the top the 

860
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:39,962
only question you might have though Is that in the factorial can we keep multiplying down 

861
01:32:39,962 --> 01:32:41,550
until we get that one?

862
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:45,920
Which doesn't really make a difference, but before you think 

863
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,070
about it too much you might wonder Hang on you know on the bottom.

864
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:54,140
I'm multiplying everything, and I'm adding this log of 1 but on the top From what we

01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:58,778
found before I never saw that log of 1 does that make any difference and the answer is 

866
01:32:58,778 --> 01:33:03,362
no Because log of 1 is saying 10 to the power of what equals 1 and the answer is 0 So 

867
01:33:03,362 --> 01:33:08,160
in fact Taking the log of 100 factorial is the same as adding the logs of all the numbers 

868
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:12,158
from 2 up to 100 and it simplifies Down to 1 so to those of you who got it 

869
01:33:12,158 --> 01:33:16,955
congratulations to those of you who feel like you maybe have better intuitions for Change 

870
01:33:16,955 --> 01:33:21,593
of base formulas for the fact that logarithms turn multiplication into addition That's 

871
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:26,124
my hope in the next time with this as a foundation of logarithms that can be pointed 

872
01:33:26,124 --> 01:33:30,655
back to What I would love to talk about is what's known as the natural logarithm Log 

873
01:33:30,655 --> 01:33:35,346
base e and try to give an instinct for why that's something that we care about okay Why 

874
01:33:35,346 --> 01:33:39,983
is it that mathematicians just seem to really love the number e sitting in the base of 

875
01:33:39,983 --> 01:33:40,890
their logarithms?

876
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,170
What does that buy for them?

877
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:49,910
Why does it show up in nature?
