  "input": "and we see this sitting around early March or so and of course this is because this is when the corona outbreak was really starting to kick into high gear and everyone wanted to understand exponential growth and a common way that exponential growth is plotted is with what's known as a logarithmic scale so I actually made a video about this and in it I was creating some animations and wanted to illustrate this idea of exponential growth and the main idea here, I'll go ahead and skip back to a different animation is if you're tracking the numbers, in this case this was the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 outside of mainland China in the months leading up to March you could just track what the absolute number is but the pattern that you'll find is that as you go from one day to the next, you tend to be increasing multiplicatively it's a little bit like earlier, we were seeing the powers of 10 one step to the next, you're multiplying by some amount the way that the virus was growing was very similar from one day to the next, you're multiplying not quite by a constant but in this case, for this sequence of days, it was around 1.2 in that region, you're multiplying by something so when you're plotting this, it ends up looking like this classic exponential curve that curves upward and I can sometimes make it hard to see where it's going or what the overall pattern is so a common trick is to say, instead of looking at this y-axis that increases linearly as in here I'm going from 5k to 10k, 10k to 15k, 15k to 20k each step is additive, we're adding 5,000 instead use a y-axis where each step is multiplicative so you're going from 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10, 10,000 all of these are increases by multiplying by 10 and what you can say is the y-axis is now plotting not the total number of cases but the logarithm of the total number of cases and this actually makes it kind of easier to see on a plot if you wanted to project out what that trend would do and it's a little bit of a naive model to say, oh it's going to grow exactly exponentially but in the early phases of something like this, that is what it is so I kind of fast-forward in the animation I made for that video and what's interesting is if back then, I think I posted it on March 6th if you just found a line of best fit and you stretched it out and you said, when is that line going to cross a million?",

  "input": "that is such a fantastic question, Max and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication you're not, I'll just draw it out for you actually this is going to be easiest if we have some kind of exponential relationship let's say 10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000 there's three different numbers at play here showing a relationship between the 10, the 3, and the 1000 and aside from writing it with an exponent there's two other ways we could write that same relationship we could also say that the cube root of 1000 is equal to 10 this is asking 1000, what number raised to the third is equal to 1000 that's sort of what the cube root is asking and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3 three different notations, the same exact relationship a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship between the three numbers with a triangle where you'd have our 10 sitting down here the power sitting at the top, 10 to the third and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right and whenever you want to talk about a function or an operation between two of these numbers you indicate which one of them you're leaving out so to write 10 cubed, we would include the 10 on the lower left the 3 on the upper right, and then we leave out that bottom one so this is indicating that we're taking a power, 10 cubed for that radical, what you would say is we know what's on the bottom right something to some power equals 1000 we even know what the power is something cubed equals that 1000 but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation where if the thing you don't know instead of being on that bottom right is on the bottom left but what logarithms are, it's an inverse in another sense because what it's saying is, in this triangle relationship we know the base, it's 10 we know the power that it should be, 1000 but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent so to answer your question maybe even more briefly we could say that 10 to the x, the inverse of that the inverse is the log base 10 you know, of y, of some other variable whereas if you're taking x to the 10th, some unknown raised to a power the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value and on the triangle it's basically asking which of the things do we consider to be a variable so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity are you considering that top to be a variable quantity and what is the unknown but I really liked this idea of making explicit how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers one of them we introduce a new symbol, this radical and one of them we introduce a new word, log so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation and while I don't necessarily think that we should teach logarithms with this triangle because convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression what I do like about it and starting off with it is when you see and think about this triangle it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that exponent every time that you see log of some value you should think in your mind, okay, whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent it wants to be an exponent and we'll see more of what that means as we go on okay, so every time you see a log it wants to be an exponent this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is now in terms of convention for the first part of this video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it to be the shorthand for log base 10 because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there you should know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e there's also another notation for that ln for natural log we're going to talk all about the natural log next time so don't worry too much about that right now and there's also yet another convention often if you're in a computer science setting log without any added sugar to indicate what it is defaults to meaning log base 2 so this can sometimes be a source of confusion but it basically depends on what discipline you're in in math, not moth, math people really like a base of e, we'll see why next lecture in, I don't know, I'll say engineering but really it's anything where you want good intuition with our normal base 10 number system log means log base 10 and if you're curious, often in computer science settings log base 2 comes up all the time so, like I said, in the back of your mind if you're trying to think of some of these properties just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number that can get you a really far way so we're going to start going through a

  "input": "none of the above and remember like I said earlier we should fully expect that all of those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well they're going to be answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly but if you're someone who doesn't, don't let that intimidate you when you're looking at a problem like this one what I would encourage you to do is just plug in various powers of 10 and think in terms of the idea that the log function counts the number of zeros so I'll give you a little moment to think about that so I'll go ahead and grade it and as always if that's faster than what you're comfortable with know that it's only because I want to proceed forward with the lesson so in this case the correct answer comes out to be log of 1000 times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x and now let's think about that for a moment and like I said when you're just getting started with them I think the best thing to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers and the best numbers to plug in are the ones that are already powers of 10 so if you're asking something like log of 1000 times x well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x log of 1000 times 100 well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here well 1000 times 100 is 100,000 we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10 we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000 the 2 zeros from that 100 and we're putting them next to each other so it should be 5 total zeros but if you really reflect not just on how did the number turn out but why did it turn out that way it was the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100 which we could also write by saying the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100 so this idea that a logarithm of the product of two things is the sum of the logarithms of those two things in the context of powers of 10 that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive idea for a lot of us if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them you just take all of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other so the way I've written things out here it's actually indicative of a slightly more general fact which is going to be our very first property of logarithms which is that if we take the log of A times B it equals the log of A plus the log of B now any time you see one of these logarithm rules if you find yourself squinting your eyes or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it just plug in examples I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot but it's because I think it's very easy to forget once you're swamped in the algebra itself and you're sitting on some kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols to remind yourself you are okay to just plug in some numbers that's a fine thing to do and often it's a great way to yield intuition so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart we could just think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000 which is 5, there's 5 zeros in it breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part great, wonderful so carrying that intuition further let's try another practice problem and again, if you know it, great, you'll be able to answer it fine but maybe think, not just what is the answer but how would I explain this answer to someone or how would I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own without me having to tell them what the answer is so there's two potential audience members there's those who are interested in the lesson itself and then those who are interested in the meta lesson so our question asks, again, which of the following is true?",

  "input": "so the correct answer here is a, which it looks like 4,000 of you got congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x so, again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself I think a fine place to start is plugging something in and in this case, for log of x to the power n let's just try it with 100 to the power 3 and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way sometimes one example will do because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking well, that's 3 copies of 100 I'm taking 3 copies of 100 and when I multiply all that out and I think of log as counting the number of zeros we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100 I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together to get a million so this number is going to be 6 but if we think actually why was it 6 not just that's the number of zeros inside the million where that 6 came from is that we had 3 copies of that 100 and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros so that way it's a more general way you can think about it where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking at 1000 cubed or 1000 to the n or x to the power n you can think that it's whatever that value of n was the number of copies we were multiplying in times the number of well, let's see, it's not x times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted for x which in this case was 100 so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 to the power n this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000 counting the number of zeros in each one of them which is 4 so it would be n times 4 and of course the general property that most of you correctly answered is that you have this lovely little effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power that little power hops down in front of it and you just have log of what was on the inside now one of the maybe most important implications of that I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition if I'm taking log and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10 of 10 to the power n we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10 which is of course 1 this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at the end or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10 and the answer is simply 1 which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n oh well the answer is n ok now with every given logarithm property that we have so in this case we just found one log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves a little bit of intuition for these so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here try to hide where we're going what we just found raising something to the n that hops in front this corresponds to the exponential property that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms which is they kind of they're like exponentiation turned inside out and here's what I mean by that the thing sitting on the inside of the log if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for something that's exponential in this case the a the thing on the inside corresponds to 10 to the x the output of the function whereas the entire thing itself the log of a corresponds to what's on the inside over here just what's the exponent of the 10 so wherever you see a log expression here you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side and every time you see an exponential the entire 10 to the x expression the whole outer component on the right side that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs and we saw this above the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside that's adding on the outside well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out that's telling us that multiplying on the outside multiplying the outputs of the function is the same as adding on the inside because each of these logs like log a and log b is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right so with that let's keep playing let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for so this last one, very nice thinking of exponents hopping down the next one is something that might look a little bit weird to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it and we'll give it a little bit more a moment to pull up which of the following is true?",

  "input": "but it's weird, because when we add 10,100 well, we're no longer at a clean power of ten and okay, that's fine, you know, often you're taking logarithms of things that aren't clean powers of ten but it becomes very strange to ask how you express this in terms of log of 100 which was two and log of 10,000 which was four because if you look at log of 10,100, it's asking ten to the what is equal to 10,100 you might say, I don't know, it's going to be a little above four because it's kind of close to 10,000 so the best you might guess here is, oh, this is going to be something that's kind of like the log of 10,000 but that just feels like a coincidence based on the two numbers that we happened to put in there's not a nice systematic reason coming there so maybe you guess, oh, if the numbers a and b are very different it's kind of close to whatever the maximum of them is but it's very bizarre and most importantly, for the sake of the quiz if you just look at the options that it's giving you if you try this out with any particular numbers, you'll find that none of those actually work so, all is good sometimes you get something that looks like it's going to be a nice property but it doesn't end up being a nice property and I also think that's important rather than just finding yourself only working with the various, you know, log of a times b or log of x to the power n these things that have a nice rule sometimes you're out in the mathematical wild, you're working on some problem you have a logarithm expression and it's adding things in the input and you want to be able to have familiarity with the fact that that's kind of weird that you're not going to be able to simplify but if you, you know, if you hadn't thought about that before you might wonder, oh, is there just some formula that I haven't seen before so with all of that, let me go ahead and take a couple questions from the audience before we transition to a different sort of example so it looks like Uma Sherma asks can the base be zero?",

  "input": "well in terms of our triangle we might think of that as saying you know, zero to some kind of power x is equal to some other value y this is something that we could write either by saying zero to the x equals y or we could write the same thing by saying log base zero of y is equal to x zero to the what equals x now the issue here is that zero to anything ends up being zero right, so if we're just going to be thinking of log base zero of y for any other input y you know, you want to input something like one or two or pi anything you might want, you're asking the question zero to the what is equal to one or two or pi or whatever number you might have there and there's just not going to be an answer so at best you could try to say oh yes, log of zero, it's a perfectly valid function it's only defined on the input zero but even then you'd have trouble trying to finagle what you want there because saying zero to the what equals zero it's like anything applies to it so your arm is going to be twisted behind your back however you want to make that work and it corresponds to the fact that the exponential function with base zero is entirely zero it doesn't map numbers in a nice one to one fashion onto each other so that's a great question, can you have a log base zero now back to the idea of where these things come up in the real world one example I kind of like is the Richter scale for earthquakes so the Richter scale gives us a quantification for how strong an earthquake is and it can be anything from very small numbers up to very large numbers like I think the largest earthquake ever measured and this is just a chart that comes from Wikipedia was a 9.5 and to appreciate just how insane that is it's worth looking at the relationship between what these numbers mean and then something like the equivalent amount of TNT some sort of measure of how much energy there is in it and then what we can try to do here is see if we can get an expression for the Richter scale number in terms of the amount of energy and why logarithms would be a natural way to describe this so the key to focus on is as we're taking steps forward how much do things increase so for example if we go from two well in this case it doesn't show us where three is so maybe we think of taking a step from two up to four which is kind of like taking two steps what does that do in terms of the amount of energy well it looks like it takes us from one metric ton of TNT which is I guess a large bomb from World War II and it takes us up to a kiloton a thousand times as much which is a small atom bomb so just two steps on the Richter scale going from an earthquake of magnitude 2 to an earthquake of magnitude 4 takes us from large bomb from World War II up to the nuclear age so that is noteworthy and the first clean step that we get is going from 4 to 5 at least in terms of what this chart is nicely showing us and evidently a single step up from 4 to 5 corresponds to going from 1 kiloton to 32 kilotons and that was evidently the size of the city destroying bomb that landed on Nagasaki so this is maybe one thing that can be counterintuitive about logarithmic scales if you're just hearing in the news the difference between oh there was an earthquake that was a 4.0 versus an earthquake that was a 5.0 it's easy to think yeah 4 and 5 those are pretty similar numbers but evidently in terms of TNT amounts that corresponds to multiplying by 32 to get from 1 to the next and going from 2 to 4 was evidently multiplying by about a thousand and the only reason that's bigger is because here our chart wasn't showing what 3 was so we were taking two steps and you can verify for yourself that if you take a step of 32 and then you multiply by another 32 that's actually pretty close to a thousand so the idea that additive steps on the Richter number correspond to multiplicative steps in the TNT seems to suggest that something logarithmic is at play here and it's a little interesting to just keep going here and say how much does this grow partly because of the world phenomena it's describing yes not a huge surprise that as we take another step it's multiplying by about 32 again but reining that in to our intuitions that's the difference between 32 kilotons a small atom bomb and then one megaton which we might think of as not small atom bomb, Nagasaki atom bomb which I guess is 32 of the Nagasaki atom bombs for one megaton that is evidently the magnitude of the double string flat earthquake in Nevada USA 1994 I didn't know what that was, thanks Wikipedia in terms of frequencies by the way I also looked these up evidently ones that are less than two, those happen all the time there's like 8000 of those per day but as soon as we're in the realm of atom bombs things like 3.5 and 4 those evidently also happen quite frequently somewhere on the earth there's around 134 of those happening somewhere every day who knew?",

  "input": "but as we get even more intense into this 5 and 6 range which were well above the atom bomb scale now we're only merely at around 2 per day and I'm sure that a geologist could come in and explain why we all shouldn't be super worried about the fact that there's two atom bomb equivalent disruptions to the earth's crust happening every day but presumably it's particularly rare for those to be concentrated on some spot like a city where lots of people live now just verifying our thought that each step involves a growth of 32 let's look at what the step from 6 up to 7 looks like and here it's giving us lots more examples in between maybe giving the illusion that that's a bigger step than it actually is and indeed that's the difference between 1 megaton and 32 megatons so that's multiplying by 32 one of the things I found most interesting on this chart by the way was look at how far we have to go before we get to the largest nuclear weapon that's ever actually been tested this was height of the cold war the Tsar bomb that was 50 megatons and I believe they actually had original plans to have a 100 megaton bomb but talked themselves down from that 50 megatons, we're talking start off at that 32 kilotons of the Nagasaki bomb multiply by 32 to get a megaton multiply by another 32 so we're talking about a thousand times the strength of the World War II ending explosion and you're still not at the 50 megatons of what humanity is capable of and that is evidently the Java earthquake of Indonesia so 7.0 is not just a little bit bigger than 6.0, it's a lot bigger and the point here of course is just that when you have a scale giving you multiplicative increases it's worth appreciating that what look like small steps can actually be huge steps in terms of the energy implied or the absolute values implied here so when we're thinking about the fact that there was ever a 9.5 that actually seems absurd given that it's only in the 7.0 range that we're talking about the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out and this is indicative of one area where logarithms tend to come about it's when humans want to create a scale for something that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be so in the case of size of earthquakes you can have things from what happens just all the time around the Earth, the size of a large hand grenade and you want that to be on your scale and something to think about ranging all the way up to the largest disruption that we've seen in human history and in order to have that in a way that you're not just writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case and a whole bunch of different, a smaller number of digits for your number in another case it's nice to take logarithms and then just put that on a single scale that basically squishes those numbers between 0 and 10 you see something very similar going on with the decibel scale for music that one actually works a little bit differently where every time you take a step up of 10 decibels that corresponds to multiplying by 10 so rather than a step of 1 multiplying by 10, it's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10 so that kind of makes the math of it a little bit screwy but the idea is the same, that if you're listening to a sound that's 50 decibels versus 60 decibels it's a lot quieter in terms of the energy being transmitted and going from, what would it be, 60 to 70 or 70 to 80 those steps, from 60 up to 80, that involves multiplying the amount of energy per square area by a factor of 100 so every time you see a logarithmic scale, know in your mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount this is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus outbreak so how might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the Richter scale number by 1, you're multiplying by 32 well, we could think in terms of a log with base 32 I could say if I take the log of, I'm just going to call r, the number for the Richter scale I might think of this as log base 32 and that's going to correspond to, no no no, I'm doing this wrong that's not the thing that's logged we take the log base 32 of the big number, of the TMT number, something that was like 1 megaton it's 1 million tons the log base 32, that should correspond to the Richter scale number but there might be some kind of offset, so we might say that there's some kind of constant s that we're adding to this Richter scale number and this expression is exactly the same, excuse me for going off the bottom there this expression is exactly the same as saying 32 to the power of some offset times our Richter scale number which is the same as taking 32 to that offset, which itself is just some big constant, times 32 to the Richter scale number so you might think of this as just being some constant times 32 to the power of the number you see so this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it that if this is what corresponds to the TMT amount that you see, as you increase that r step by step you're multiplying by 32 but another way of communicating the exact same fact is to take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is alright now the next thing I want to talk about is how we don't always have to worry about how to compute logs of different bases it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32, I referenced earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e computer scientists really like to have a log with base 2 and it turns out for computational purposes or for also thinking about how these things grow if you have one log, if you're able to compute one type of log, whether that's base 10, base 2, base e you can compute pretty much anything else that you want now to get our intuitions in that direction, let's turn back to our quiz and go to the next question and I believe that this question is the most, I don't know, this is a halfway reasonable question, this should be nice this is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2 context to base 10 context and it's also a good intuition for understanding powers of 2 to have in general the relationship that it has with powers of 10 because it's this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that these two sort of well you'll see what I mean, they play nicely with each other so our question asks, given the fact that 2 to the 10th is 1024, 1024, which is approximately 1000 so if you're being a little bit loose with your numbers and you're just making approximations 2 to the 10th, basically 1000, which of the following is closest to being true?",

  "input": "you you you okay so even if you are still thinking about it I'm gonna go ahead and grade it here and then start talking about why it's true and then also why we should care why this is an operation that actually tells us something so the correct answer which it looks like around 1700 of you got congratulations is log base C of B times log base B of A is equal to log base C of A great now that's just a big ol pile of things why would that be true how do we think about it now phase one like I said we might plug in an example but let's try to actually think about why the example holds so let me pull out we've got this as one more of the log rules this is just repeating the end what the correct answer turned out to be where we've got an expression for log base C of B log base B of A and this ends up being log base C of A it's gotten rid of the B's which is kind of interesting so some examples you might plug in here would be things like let's use a different color let's use green instead of C I'm gonna go ahead and plug in 10 log base 10 of 100 which is kind of asking how many times does 10 go into an 100 in a multiplicative sense how many times do I multiply 10 by itself to get to 100 where the answer is 2 and then log of 100 of let's plug in another power of 10 it'll be nice if it's also a power of 100 so I'll do a million so this one is asking 10 100 to the what equals a million how many times do I multiply a hundred by itself to get to a million how many times does a hundred go into a million phrasing the same thing ten different ways now the claim is that this is the same thing as taking log base 10 of a million that if I ask how many times does 10 go into 100 and how many times does 100 go into a million multiplying those should give me the answer to how many times 10 goes into a million now just checking the numbers this certainly works 10 goes into a hundred two times 100 goes into a million three times in a multiplicative sense in that a hundred cubed is equal to a million and indeed how many times does 10 go into a million well six now we could think of this property in terms of the corresponding exponent rule which is going to look a little bit stranger but it's actually just saying the entirely the same thing so here we're if we have a base of C and a base of B and we're trying to relate those to each other the whole statement is equal to saying that um suppose that B to the X is equal to a got some number B you raise it to some number X and equals a suppose it's also the case that C to the Y equals B those two together are the same as saying C to the XY equals a now that's kind of a mouthful to say out loud but if you plug in some numbers to translate what all of that is really saying in the context of the example we just did saying if you can write a hundred is ten squared and if you can write a million as a hundred cubed well that lets you write a million in terms of a power of ten okay so sort of asking this question how many times does one number go into another but letting you layer it on top of each other now if we rearrange that expression we get what is probably the second most important of all of our log rules the most important is this top one that when you multiply the inputs you add the outputs but the second most important which is known as the change of base formula lets us rate that if you want the log base B of some value a then for whatever C you want it doesn't actually matter what log you have in your pocket if you use that other log and you take the log C of a divided by the log C of B that gives you log base B of a okay so just as an example here what this would look like is let's say I wanted to be able to compute log base 100 of things I just really want to it's not a button on my calculator but I would love to be able to do it and I want to do it in with an input like a million well even if I don't have the log base 100 button on my calculator what I can do is say I'll use the log base 10 button and evaluate what's on the inside here which at least positionally it's kind of above the 100 it has a higher altitude as we write it so this can line up with the notation a little bit that it sits on the numerator and on the bottom I use the log base 10 button that's in my calculator on the base on the 100 and then I can evaluate both of those and it'll give me the answer in this case it gets you 6 divided by 2 which will be 3 and if we really just think through what this is saying I know I've said it many different times but it's a it's a convoluted enough way to write things but an intuitive enough fact that I think just coming at it from a bunch of different angles can be important because like I said this is probably the second most important log rule we're asking how many times does 100 go into a million in a multiplicative sense how many times they multiply by itself but division is asking that same question in an additive sense if I say how many times does the log of 100 go into the log of a million that's what division means it's saying how many times do I add this bottom number to itself to get to the top but anything additive in the logarithm realm is the same as anything multiplicative in terms of what's inside the parentheses so both of the left-hand side and the right-hand side are just saying how many times does 100 go into a million but going about that in different ways so this is extremely nice because it actually lets us compute things next time we're going to talk all about the natural logarithm which is log base e often written ln and turns out this is much easier to compute there's nice math behind it such that if you want to come up with an algorithm that your calculator can use it's actually a lot easier to think of log base e of numbers so anytime that you need to go to some kind of calculator I don't know let's say we popped over to something like Desmos always happy to have as a friend and you wanted to compute log base 10 of some number you know let's say we're doing log base 10 of 57 and it looks like that's you know it should make sense it's between 1 and 2 because 57 was between 10 and 100 what's going on under the hood how is it actually figuring this out it's going to use somewhere in there a change of base formula which is going to be that the natural log of 57 divided by the natural log of 10 is the same thing these are two different ways of writing it so if you know one logarithm you know all of the logarithms okay and well let's just use that fact to answer one more of our quiz questions and this will be the second to last quiz question so thank you all for sticking it through I think we will be I think you'll be pleased by the last question because the last question will actually be like a fun problem-solving puzzle II thing and it will involve a lot of what we've used up to this point kind of a culminating thing so before that though just to make sure that we've got the instincts of change of base down what do we have use the approximation that log base 2 of 10 is around 10 thirds so using that approximation which of the following is approximately true log base 2 of X is about 10 thirds of log base 10 of X log base 2 of X is log base 10 of 10 thirds of X log base 2 of X is log base 10 of X to the power 10 thirds or log base 2 of X is 10 thirds times the log base 10 of X and finally none of the above so I'll give you a moment to think about that you might want to think to the chart that we were drawing earlier and thinking about log base 2 and log base 10 as we're looking at powers of 1000 and how each of those grows that can leverage some of the intuition but I'll let you think about it stop talking you while answers are rolling in it looks like a number of people have been asking on Twitter about basically how complex numbers play into this so you know we've got Jamil asking what if the base is imaginary we've got Kalkan asking what about complex bases since e to the X is walking around the spiral wouldn't it hit every complex number we won't hit every complex number but your instinct that it's hitting multiple things is pretty spot-on doesn't make sense to talk about logs with imaginary numbers by Nitya so to all of these questions it's actually a very nuanced question the short answer is yes complex log rhythms absolutely exist but each one of them has multiple different outputs so a good a good analogy here is how if we have the square root function if I ask something like the square root of 5 you know we have the convention that you always do the positive amount but that doesn't quite feel honest it feels like the right answer is to specify that there's two different outputs for the square root function two solutions to x squared equals 25 and this is actually true in complex numbers as well one of the things we talked about in a complex number lecture was that you can take the square root of I and you actually get root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I but that there's two solutions you can do plus or minus this value and so you could say that the square root function isn't a function but it's a multi-valued function it always has two different outputs now something funky happens when we have exponents at play so if you're just like someone who hasn't seen this stuff don't worry we talked about it in previous lectures I'm obviously jumping around on the complexity level a lot here where if in lecture five I'm talking about like Euler's formula with complex numbers and compound interest and like how that plays into physics and then lecture six we're back to the basics of logarithms I acknowledge that might be a little bit jarring to potential audience members but just continuing on with the answer if you note that e to the 2 pi times you know some number times I this basically walks you around a circle so that the output will walk around a circle and just keep repeating as n goes from 0 up to 1 it'll walk around one cycle and end up back where you started as n goes from 1 to 2 you'll end up back where you started so for example e to the 0 sits here e to the I pi is at negative 1 but e to the 2 pi I is also at 1 same with e excuse me same with e to the 4 pi I that also equals 1 so in general if you wanted to ask something like what is the log base e of 1 you know the one hand we want to say the log of log base anything of 1 should be 0 because anything to the power 0 equals that 1 but if we're letting complex numbers into the mix you would have to honestly say well 2 pi I is another pretty good answer to this question because e to the 2 pi I also equals 1 and same with 4 pi I and you could even go in the negative direction and in general n times pi times 2 times I kind of wrote that in a weird order for any integer in feels like a valid answer to this question so there's a couple ways that you can deal with that in math and before we get back to our usual lesson just on logarithm rules this is interesting enough I kind of want to pull it up let's see what if we have complex logarithm great Wikipedia always to our aid probably it'll have a nice like visual of some kind for us look such fancy color diagrams what I want okay this is what I want wonderful let's zoom out a little bit great so there's this notion of what's called a Riemann surface that's basically trying to capture the idea that you have a function with multiple outputs and intuitively maybe you can understand what it's getting at where the input would be something on the XY plane and the output there's just many different outputs sitting there so when you have a complex logarithm you have to account for that but it's used it's actually a very useful idea to do but it takes a lot more nuance than than you might expect so with all of that hopefully that helped at least partially answer some of people's questions same same by the way with logarithms with based negative numbers because if you're asking like negative 1 to the X and really noodling on what that means it's it gets you into the realm of complex numbers so you have to deal with the same multiple output idea now answers are rolling in more slowly so this seems like a fine time to grade things and the answer turns out to be you rescale it if you want to go from log base 2 of something to log base 10 of something it involves rescaling and one way you could think about this is with the change of base formula so let's say we have now let's get rid of our E stuff let's say you have log base 2 of X but we want to write it in terms of log base 10 we can write that as log base 10 of X divided by log base 10 of 2 saying how many times does 2 go into X in a multiplicative sense is the same as saying how many times does the log of 2 go into the log of X in an additive sense okay and well what is 1 divided by the log base 10 of 2 so we're going to keep our log base 10 of X out here and from what we found earlier we found that log base 10 of 2 was approximately 3 tenths was approximately 0.3 so when we divide by it that should get us 10 thirds okay and this lines up with what we were looking at a little bit earlier with powers of 1000 let's see where was it where was it great so when we're converting from log base 10 of something up to log base 2 you know here we were thinking of multiplying the top by 0.",
  "translatedText": "אתה בסדר, אז גם אם אתה עדיין חושב על זה, אני אקדים את זה לדרג את זה כאן ואז אתחיל לדבר על למה זה נכון ואז גם למה שיהיה אכפת לנו למה זה ניתוח שבעצם אומר לנו משהו אז התשובה הנכונה שנראה כאילו בסביבות 1700 מכם יש ברכות היא בסיס יומן C של B כפול בסיס יומן B של A שווה לבסיס יומן C של A נהדר עכשיו זה רק ערימה גדולה של דברים למה זה יהיה נכון איך אנחנו תחשוב על זה עכשיו שלב ראשון כמו שאמרתי אולי נחבר דוגמה אבל בוא ננסה לחשוב באמת למה הדוגמה מתקיימת אז תן לי לשלוף יש לנו את זה בתור אחד מכללי היומן זה רק לחזור על הסוף מה התברר שהתשובה הנכונה היא היכן שיש לנו ביטוי לבסיס יומן C של B יומן בסיס B של A וזה בסופו של דבר הוא בסיס יומן C של A זה נפטר מה-B, וזה די מעניין אז כמה דוגמאות אתה יכול להיות שתחבר כאן יהיו דברים כמו בוא נשתמש בצבע אחר בוא נשתמש בירוק במקום C אני אמשיך ואחבר 10 יומנים בסיס 10 מתוך 100 שזה סוג של שואל כמה פעמים 10 נכנס ל-100 ב- חוש כפל כמה פעמים אני מכפיל 10 בעצמו כדי להגיע ל-100 שבו התשובה היא 2 ואז יומן של 100 של בוא נחבר עוד חזקה של 10 זה יהיה נחמד אם זה גם חזק של 100 אז אני אעשה מיליון אז זה שואל 10 100 עד מה שווה מיליון כמה פעמים אני מכפיל מאה בעצמו כדי להגיע למיליון כמה פעמים מאה נכנסים למיליון ניסוח אותו דבר בעשר דרכים שונות עכשיו הטענה זה אותו דבר כמו לקחת בסיס יומן 10 מתוך מיליון שאם אני שואל כמה פעמים 10 נכנס ל-100 וכמה פעמים 100 נכנס למיליון כפל, אלה אמורים לתת לי את התשובה לכמה פעמים 10 הולך למיליון עכשיו רק בודקים את המספרים זה בהחלט עובד 10 נכנס למאה פעמיים 100 נכנס למיליון שלוש פעמים במובן מכפלי בכך שמאה קוביות שווה למיליון ואכן כמה פעמים 10 נכנס למיליון טוב שש עכשיו נוכל לחשוב על המאפיין הזה במונחים של כלל המעריך המתאים שעומד להיראות קצת יותר מוזר אבל זה בעצם אומר את אותו הדבר לגמרי אז הנה אם יש לנו בסיס של C ובסיס של B ואנחנו מנסים לקשר את אלה זה לזה כל המשפט שווה לאמירה שאמ נניח ש-B ל-X שווה ל-a יש מספר B אתה מעלה אותו למספר X ושווה ל- נניח שזה גם ה- במקרה ש-C ל-Y שווה ל-B השניים האלה ביחד זהים לאמירת C ל-XY שווה ל-עכשיו, זה סוג של פליטת פה להגיד בקול, אבל אם תחבר כמה מספרים כדי לתרגם את מה שכל זה באמת אומר ב- ההקשר של הדוגמה שהרגע אמרנו אם אתה יכול לכתוב מאה זה עשר בריבוע ואם אתה יכול לכתוב מיליון כמאה בקוביות טוב שמאפשר לך לכתוב מיליון במונחים של חזקה של עשר אוקיי אז סוג של שואל את השאלה הזאת איך פעמים רבות האם מספר אחד נכנס למספר אחר, אבל נותן לך שכבת אותו אחד על השני עכשיו אם נסדר מחדש את הביטוי הזה נקבל את מה שהוא כנראה השני הכי חשוב מכל כללי היומן שלנו, החשוב ביותר הוא זה העליון שכאשר אתה מכפיל את הכניסות אתה מוסיף את הפלטים אבל השני הכי חשוב שמכונה נוסחת השינוי של הבסיס מאפשר לנו לדרג שאם אתה רוצה את בסיס היומן B בעל ערך כלשהוא אז עבור כל C שאתה רוצה זה לא משנה איזה יומן אתה יש בכיס שלך אם אתה משתמש ביומן השני ואתה לוקח את היומן C של a חלקי היומן C של B שנותן לך בסיס יומן B של אוקיי אז רק כדוגמה כאן איך זה ייראה זה בוא נגיד שרציתי כדי להיות מסוגל לחשב בסיס יומן של 100 דברים אני פשוט מאוד רוצה שזה לא כפתור במחשבון שלי אבל אני אשמח להיות מסוגל לעשות את זה ואני רוצה לעשות את זה עם קלט כמו מיליון טוב גם אם אני לא אין לי את כפתור היומן בסיס 100 במחשבון שלי, מה שאני יכול לעשות זה לומר שאני אשתמש בלחצן בסיס 10 היומן ואעריך מה יש כאן בפנים, שלפחות מבחינה מיקומית זה בערך מעל ה-100 יש לו גובה גבוה יותר ככל שאנו כתוב את זה כדי שזה יתאים קצת לסימון שהוא יושב על המונה ובחלק התחתון אני משתמש בכפתור היומן בסיס 10 שנמצא במחשבון שלי על הבסיס על ה-100 ואז אני יכול להעריך את שניהם ואת זה אתן לי את התשובה במקרה הזה זה יקבל 6 חלקי 2 שיהיו 3 ואם באמת נחשוב מה זה אומר אני יודע שאמרתי את זה הרבה פעמים אבל זו דרך מפותלת מספיק כתוב דברים אבל עובדה מספיק אינטואיטיבית שלדעתי רק להסתכל על זה מכמה זוויות שונות יכולה להיות חשובה כי כמו שאמרתי זה כנראה כלל היומן השני הכי חשוב שאנחנו שואלים כמה פעמים 100 נכנסים למיליון חוש כפל כמה פעמים הם מכפילים מעצמם אבל חלוקה היא שואלת את אותה שאלה במובן נוסף אם אני אגיד כמה פעמים הלוג של 100 נכנס ללוג של מיליון זה מה שחילוק אומר, זה אומר כמה פעמים אני הוסף את המספר התחתון הזה לעצמו כדי להגיע לראש, אבל כל דבר מתוסף בתחום הלוגריתם זהה לכל דבר כפל מבחינת מה שיש בתוך הסוגריים אז גם בצד שמאל וגם בצד ימין אומרים כמה פעמים האם 100 נכנסים למיליון, אבל אנחנו עושים את זה בדרכים שונות אז זה מאוד נחמד כי זה בעצם מאפשר לנו לחשב דברים בפעם הבאה שנדבר הכל על הלוגריתם הטבעי שהוא בסיס יומן e כתוב לעתים קרובות ב- ומסתבר זה הרבה יותר קל לחישוב, יש מתמטיקה נחמדה מאחורי זה, כך שאם אתה רוצה להמציא אלגוריתם שהמחשבון שלך יכול להשתמש בו, זה למעשה הרבה יותר קל לחשוב על בסיס יומן e של מספרים, כך שבכל עת שאתה צריך ללכת לאיזשהו סוג. של מחשבון אני לא יודע בוא נגיד שקפצנו למשהו כמו דסמוס תמיד שמח להיות חבר ורצית לחשב בסיס יומן 10 של מספר שאתה מכיר בוא נגיד שאנחנו עושים בסיס יומן 10 מתוך 57 וזה נראה ככה אתה יודע שזה צריך להיות הגיוני זה בין 1 ל-2 כי 57 היה בין 10 ל-100 מה קורה מתחת למכסה המנוע איך זה בעצם להבין שזה הולך להשתמש איפשהו שם בשינוי של נוסחת הבסיס שתהיה שהלוג הטבעי של 57 חלקי הלוג הטבעי של 10 זה אותו הדבר, אלו שתי דרכים שונות לכתוב אותו, אז אם אתה מכיר לוגריתם אחד אתה מכיר את כל הלוגריתמים בסדר ובכן, בוא נשתמש בעובדה הזו כדי לענות על עוד אחד שאלות החידון שלנו וזו תהיה שאלת החידון השנייה אחרונה אז תודה לכולם על שהצלחתם. אני חושב שנהיה אני חושב שתהיו מרוצה מהשאלה האחרונה כי השאלה האחרונה תהיה למעשה כמו פתרון בעיות מהנה דבר הפאזל השני והוא יכלול הרבה ממה שהשתמשנו עד לנקודה זו סוג של דבר שהגיע לשיאו אז לפני כן רק כדי לוודא שיש לנו את האינסטינקטים של שינוי בסיס מה יש לנו להשתמש ב- הערכה שבסיס יומן 2 מתוך 10 הוא בסביבות 10 שליש, כך ששימוש בקירוב זה, איזה מהבאים הוא בערך בסיס יומן 2 של X הוא בערך 10 שליש מבסיס יומן 10 של X יומן בסיס 2 של X הוא בסיס יומן 10 מתוך 10 שלישים של X log base 2 של X הוא בסיס יומן 10 של X בחזקת 10 שליש או בסיס יומן 2 של X הוא פי 10 שליש מבסיס יומן 10 של X ולבסוף אף אחד מהדברים לעיל אז אני אתן לך רגע לחשוב על שאולי תרצה לחשוב על התרשים שציירנו קודם לכן ולחשוב על בסיס יומן 2 ובסיס יומן 10 כשאנחנו מסתכלים על כוחות של 1000 וכיצד כל אחד מאלה גדל שיכול למנף חלק מהאינטואיציה, אבל אני אעשה זאת. תן לך לחשוב על זה תפסיק לדבר איתך בזמן שהתשובות מתגלגלות זה נראה כאילו מספר אנשים שאלו בטוויטר על איך בעצם מספרים מרוכבים משתלבים בזה, אז אתה יודע שיש לנו את ג'מיל שואל מה אם הבסיס הוא דמיוני אנחנו' יש לי את קלקאן שואל מה לגבי בסיסים מרוכבים מכיוון ש-e ל-X מסתובב בספירלה האם הוא לא יפגע בכל מספר מרוכב, לא נפגע בכל מספר מרוכב אבל האינסטינקט שלך שהוא פוגע במספר דברים הוא די נקודתי לא הגיוני לדבר על יומנים עם מספרים דמיוניים מאת Nitya אז לכל השאלות האלה זו למעשה שאלה מאוד מגוונת התשובה הקצרה היא כן מקצבי יומן מורכבים קיימים בהחלט אבל לכל אחד מהם יש מספר יציאות שונות אז יש כאן אנלוגיה טובה. איך אם יש לנו את פונקציית השורש הריבועי אם אני שואל משהו כמו השורש של 5 אתה יודע שיש לנו את המוסכמה שאתה תמיד עושה את הכמות החיובית אבל זה לא ממש מרגיש כנה זה מרגיש שהתשובה הנכונה היא לציין שיש שני פלטים שונים לפונקציית השורש הריבועי שני פתרונות ל-x בריבוע שווה 25 וזה נכון גם במספרים מרוכבים אחד הדברים שדיברנו עליהם בהרצאה של מספר מרוכב היה שאפשר לקחת את השורש הריבועי של אני ואתה בעצם קבל שורש 2 על 2 פלוס שורש 2 על 2 I אבל שיש שני פתרונות שאתה יכול לעשות פלוס או מינוס הערך הזה ולכן אתה יכול לומר שפונקציית השורש הריבועי היא לא פונקציה אלא היא פונקציה רבת ערכים יש לה תמיד שניים פלטים שונים עכשיו משהו פאנקי קורה כשיש לנו אקספוננטים במשחק, אז אם אתה בדיוק כמו מישהו שלא ראה את הדברים האלה אל תדאג, דיברנו על זה בהרצאות קודמות, ברור שאני קופץ הרבה ברמת המורכבות כאן אם בהרצאה חמישית אני מדבר על כמו הנוסחה של אוילר עם מספרים מרוכבים וריבית דריבית וכמו איך זה משחק לפיזיקה ואז הרצאה שש, חזרנו ליסודות הלוגריתמים, אני מכיר בכך שאולי קצת צורם חברי קהל פוטנציאליים אבל פשוט ממשיך עם התשובה אם אתה שם לב ש-e עד 2 pi פעמים אתה יודע כמה מספר פעמים I זה בעצם מוביל אותך סביב מעגל כך שהפלט יסתובב סביב מעגל ופשוט תמשיך לחזור על n. 0 עד 1 זה יסתובב מחזור אחד ויגמר בחזרה למקום שבו התחלת כאשר n עובר מ-1 ל-2 אתה תסיים בחזרה למקום שבו התחלת, כך למשל e ל-0 יושב כאן e ל-I pi נמצא ב- שלילי 1 אבל e ל-2 pi I הוא גם ב-1 זהה עם e תסלח לי אותו דבר עם e ל-4 pi I שגם שווה 1 אז באופן כללי אם רצית לשאול משהו כמו מה הבסיס היומן e של 1 אתה יודע מצד אחד אנחנו רוצים לומר שהלוג של בסיס היומן כל דבר מ-1 צריך להיות 0 כי כל דבר בחזקת 0 שווה לזה 1, אבל אם אנחנו מכניסים מספרים מרוכבים לתערובת, תצטרכו לומר בכנות טוב 2 pi I הוא אחר תשובה די טובה לשאלה הזו כי e ל-2 pi I גם שווה 1 ואותוה עם 4 pi I ואתה יכול אפילו ללכת בכיוון השלילי ובאופן כללי n פעמים פי פעמים 2, בערך כתבתי את זה בסדר מוזר עבור כל מספר שלם ב- מרגיש כמו תשובה חוקית לשאלה הזו אז יש כמה דרכים שבהן אתה יכול להתמודד עם זה במתמטיקה ולפני שנחזור לשיעור הרגיל שלנו רק על כללי לוגריתם זה מספיק מעניין. אני קצת רוצה להעלות את זה. תראה מה אם יש לנו לוגריתם מורכב ויקיפדיה מצוינת תמיד לעזרתנו כנראה שיהיה לה ויזואלית נחמדה מסוג כלשהו בשבילנו נראה דיאגרמות צבע מפוארות כאלה מה אני רוצה אוקיי זה מה שאני רוצה נפלא בואו נתרחק קצת נהדר אז יש את הרעיון הזה של מה שנקרא משטח רימן שבעצם מנסה ללכוד את הרעיון שיש לך פונקציה עם יציאות מרובות ובאופן אינטואיטיבי אולי אתה יכול להבין למה זה מגיע למקום שבו הקלט יהיה משהו במישור XY והפלט יש רק הרבה תפוקות שונות יושבות שם אז כשיש לך לוגריתם מורכב אתה צריך לתת את הדעת על זה אבל הוא בשימוש זה בעצם רעיון מאוד שימושי לעשות אבל זה דורש הרבה יותר ניואנס ממה שאתה יכול לצפות אז עם כל זה אני מקווה שזה עזר לפחות ענה חלקית על כמה מהשאלות של אנשים זהה, אגב, עם לוגריתמים עם מספרים שליליים מבוססים, כי אם אתה שואל כמו 1 שלילי ל-X ובאמת מתלבט מה זה אומר שזה מכניס אותך לתחום המספרים המרוכבים אז אתה צריך תתמודד עם אותו רעיון פלט מרובה עכשיו התשובות מתגלגלות לאט יותר אז זה נראה כמו זמן מצוין לדרג דברים והתשובה מסתבר שאתה מחדש את גודלו אם אתה רוצה לעבור מבסיס יומן 2 של משהו לבסיס יומן 10 של משהו זה כרוך בשינוי קנה מידה ואחת הדרכים שבהן אתה יכול לחשוב על זה היא עם השינוי של נוסחת הבסיס אז נניח שיש לנו עכשיו בוא נפטר מהדברים E שלנו נניח שיש לך בסיס יומן 2 של X אבל אנחנו רוצים לכתוב את זה במונחים של בסיס יומן 10 נוכל לכתוב שכבסיס יומן 10 של X חלקי בסיס יומן 10 מתוך 2 לומר כמה פעמים נכנס 2 ל-X במובן כפל זהה לאמירה כמה פעמים יומן 2 נכנס ללוג של X במובן תוסף בסדר ובכן מה זה 1 חלקי בסיס היומן 10 מתוך 2 אז אנחנו נשאיר את בסיס היומן שלנו 10 של X כאן וממה שמצאנו קודם לכן גילינו שבסיס יומן 10 מתוך 2 היה כ-3 עשיריות היו בערך 0.3 אז כשאנחנו מחלקים בזה זה אמור להביא לנו 10 שלישים בסדר וזה תואם את מה שראינו קצת קודם עם חזקה של 1000 בוא נראה איפה זה היה איפה זה היה נהדר אז כשאנחנו ממירים מבסיס יומן 10 של משהו עד בסיס יומן 2 אתה יודע כאן חשבנו להכפיל את החלק העליון ב-0.",
