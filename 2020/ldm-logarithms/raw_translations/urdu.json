 {
  "input": "that is such a fantastic question, Max and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication you're not, I'll just draw it out for you actually this is going to be easiest if we have some kind of exponential relationship let's say 10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000 there's three different numbers at play here showing a relationship between the 10, the 3, and the 1000 and aside from writing it with an exponent there's two other ways we could write that same relationship we could also say that the cube root of 1000 is equal to 10 this is asking 1000, what number raised to the third is equal to 1000 that's sort of what the cube root is asking and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3 three different notations, the same exact relationship a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship between the three numbers with a triangle where you'd have our 10 sitting down here the power sitting at the top, 10 to the third and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right and whenever you want to talk about a function or an operation between two of these numbers you indicate which one of them you're leaving out so to write 10 cubed, we would include the 10 on the lower left the 3 on the upper right, and then we leave out that bottom one so this is indicating that we're taking a power, 10 cubed for that radical, what you would say is we know what's on the bottom right something to some power equals 1000 we even know what the power is something cubed equals that 1000 but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation where if the thing you don't know instead of being on that bottom right is on the bottom left but what logarithms are, it's an inverse in another sense because what it's saying is, in this triangle relationship we know the base, it's 10 we know the power that it should be, 1000 but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent so to answer your question maybe even more briefly we could say that 10 to the x, the inverse of that the inverse is the log base 10 you know, of y, of some other variable whereas if you're taking x to the 10th, some unknown raised to a power the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value and on the triangle it's basically asking which of the things do we consider to be a variable so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity are you considering that top to be a variable quantity and what is the unknown but I really liked this idea of making explicit how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers one of them we introduce a new symbol, this radical and one of them we introduce a new word, log so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation and while I don't necessarily think that we should teach logarithms with this triangle because convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression what I do like about it and starting off with it is when you see and think about this triangle it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that exponent every time that you see log of some value you should think in your mind, okay, whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent it wants to be an exponent and we'll see more of what that means as we go on okay, so every time you see a log it wants to be an exponent this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is now in terms of convention for the first part of this video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it to be the shorthand for log base 10 because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there you should know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e there's also another notation for that ln for natural log we're going to talk all about the natural log next time so don't worry too much about that right now and there's also yet another convention often if you're in a computer science setting log without any added sugar to indicate what it is defaults to meaning log base 2 so this can sometimes be a source of confusion but it basically depends on what discipline you're in in math, not moth, math people really like a base of e, we'll see why next lecture in, I don't know, I'll say engineering but really it's anything where you want good intuition with our normal base 10 number system log means log base 10 and if you're curious, often in computer science settings log base 2 comes up all the time so, like I said, in the back of your mind if you're trying to think of some of these properties just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number that can get you a really far way so we're going to start going through a couple of these properties and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples so we'll transition away from the pole and this time to the first proper question and the question asks you which

ہمارے پاس ایک اچھی تقسیم ہے۔ یہ اچھا اور دلچسپ ہے۔ جیسا کہ میں نے کہا، اس کا مقصد ایک سبق تیار کرنا ہے جس کی طرف میں مستقبل میں لوگوں کو اشارہ کر سکتا ہوں اگر وہ لوگارتھمز سے مطمئن نہیں ہیں اور میں یہ کہنے کے قابل ہونا چاہتا ہوں، اوہ، یہاں ایک ایسی جگہ ہے جہاں آپ جا سکتے ہیں میں کس طرح سوچتا ہوں، آپ جانتے ہیں، میرے خیال میں آپ اس سے بدیہی طور پر کیسے رجوع کر سکتے ہیں۔ اور ان لوگوں کے لیے جو کے کیمپوں میں ہیں، آئیے کہتے ہیں، اسے سمجھ رہے ہیں لیکن نہیں جانتے کہ اسے کیسے سکھایا جائے، میرے خیال میں لوگارتھمز کے ارد گرد ایک دلچسپ میٹا سوال ہے۔ کیونکہ میں یہ خاص لیکچر کرنے سے پہلے اساتذہ کے ایک دو فورمز کے ارد گرد اسکرول کر رہا تھا اور جب لوگ پوچھتے ہیں کہ ہائی اسکول کے ریاضی میں پڑھانے کے لیے سب سے مشکل موضوع کون سا ہے اس لحاظ سے کہ طلباء کو اس میں سب سے زیادہ پریشانی ہوتی ہے، لوگارتھمز سب سے زیادہ ہے۔ عام طور پر اشارہ کردہ جوابات جو دلچسپ ہیں اور میں اندازہ لگا سکتا ہوں کہ شاید اس کی وجہ یہ ہے کہ ان خصوصیات میں سے ایک ٹن ہے جس کے بارے میں آپ کو سیکھنا پڑے گا کہ آپ جانتے ہیں، لہذا اگر ہم اس سے آگے بڑھیں جہاں ہم جانے والے ہیں آپ کے پاس یہ تمام ڈھیر موجود ہوں گے۔ قواعد جو صرف الجبرا کے ایک گروپ کی طرح نظر آتے ہیں جو یاد رکھنا مشکل اور آپ کے دماغ میں چیزوں کو گھل مل جانا آسان ہوسکتا ہے اور میں سوچتا ہوں کہ جب لوگوں کے پاس، آپ کو معلوم ہے کہ ہائی اسکول کی ریاضی کیسی تھی اور کیسی تھی لوگارتھمز نے ان کے لیے کیا، اکثر وہ خاص فارمولے ذہن میں آتے ہیں اور آج میں جو کچھ کرنا چاہتا ہوں وہ ایک کے ذریعے بات کرنے کی کوشش کرتا ہے، ان کے بارے میں کیسے سوچنا ہے بلکہ صرف میٹا لیول پر کہ اگر آپ کسی کو الجبرا پڑھا رہے ہیں، تو کیا ہیں؟ پر زور دینے کے قابل پوائنٹس؟ ان کے وجدان میں اسے بنانے کا طریقہ کیا ہے؟ تو آئیے آگے بڑھتے ہیں اور دیکھتے ہیں کہ لوگ اس پر کیا جواب دے رہے ہیں، ہمیں تین ممکنہ زمروں کے درمیان کافی حد تک تقسیم مل گئی ہے، تو اس وقت سب سے زیادہ عام ناظرین نے C کا جواب دیا، کہ وہ انہیں سمجھتے ہیں لیکن وہ نہیں جانتے ہوں گے کہ کیسے سکھایا جائے۔ ان میں دوسرا سب سے زیادہ عام وہ لوگ ہیں جنہوں نے کہا کہ وہ انہیں اچھی طرح سمجھتے ہیں اور وہ انہیں آرام سے سکھا سکتے ہیں اس لیے یہ اس طرح سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ ٹھیک ہے، اس وقت چینل پر موجود ناظرین وہ لوگ ہیں جو ریاضی میں ہیں لوگارتھمز کے ساتھ کافی آرام دہ اور پھر اس کے بعد، B، وہ لوگ جو کچھ خاصیتوں سے الجھے ہوئے ہیں اور پھر سب سے نیچے، وہ لوگ جنہوں نے اب ان کے بارے میں کبھی نہیں سیکھا، اگر آپ ان لوگوں میں سے ایک ہیں جنہوں نے A کا جواب دیا، کہ آپ' ان کے بارے میں کبھی نہیں سیکھا یا یہ کہ آپ آرام دہ نہیں ہیں، ذہن میں رکھیں کہ یہ لیکچر درحقیقت آپ کے لیے ہے لہذا جب ہم کچھ لائیو کوئزنگ کر رہے ہوں گے اور ہمیں یہاں پر جواب ملے گا اور ہمارے پاس ہوگا لوگ، آپ جانتے ہیں، شاید بہت جلد جواب دے رہے ہیں، شاید صحیح طور پر دیا گیا ہے کہ جیسا کہ آپ دیکھ سکتے ہیں، ان میں سے اکثر لوگارتھمز کے ساتھ آرام سے آرہے ہیں اسے خوفزدہ نہ ہونے دیں، ایسا نہ ہونے دیں جو اس بات کی طرف اشارہ کرے کہ آپ کو جلدی سے جواب دینا چاہیے۔ یا آپ کو لازمی طور پر صحیح جواب ملنا چاہئے، لہذا میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ لاگز کے بارے میں سوچنے کا سب سے زیادہ بدیہی طریقہ اگر آپ ابھی شروع کرنے جا رہے ہیں، تو یہ کہنا ہے کہ ایک بہت ہی اعلی سطح پر لاگرتھم ایسی چیز ہیں جو 10 اور یہ صرف اس نمبر کے آخر میں صفر کی تعداد کو تھوک دیتا ہے جو یہ اس سے زیادہ کرتا ہے، جیسا کہ ہم بات کریں گے لیکن صرف بہت اونچی سطح پر، اس سے ان کے کاموں کا اندازہ ہو رہا ہے اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ بہت خوبصورت ہے۔ اہم کیونکہ آپ یہاں کیا کہہ رہے ہیں، ارے دیکھو، جب ہم 1 سے 10 سے 100 سے 1000 سے 10،000 تک چلتے ہیں تو ہم لاگ کے آؤٹ پٹ کو 10 سے ضرب کر رہے ہیں، اس قدر کا لاگ، صرف قدم بڑھاتے ہیں 1 کی یہ انکریمنٹس تاکہ آپ اس کے بارے میں یہ کہہ کر سوچ سکیں، ہمم، جب میں لاگ میں کسی نمبر کو لگاتا ہوں اگر وہ نمبر 10 کا پاور ہو تو میں صرف صفر کی تعداد گن رہا ہوں کہ 1000 کا لاگ کیا ہے؟ اوہ، اس پر 3 صفر ہیں ایک ملین کا لاگ کیا ہے؟ اوہ، اس پر 6 صفر ہیں یہ صفر گنتی کا فنکشن ہے اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ اپنے دماغ کے پیچھے سوچ کر لوگارتھمز کی مختلف خصوصیات کو سمجھنے کے معاملے میں خود کو بہت آگے لے جا سکتے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے، جب میں 10 کی پاور لگاتا ہوں یہ ایک صفر گنتی کا فنکشن ہے، میں ایک بلین لگاتا ہوں، ایک ارب کے آخر میں کتنے صفر ہوتے ہیں؟ اور یہ تمام اعداد ہمارے لیے بہت بدیہی ہیں، ہم ان کو خبروں میں دیکھتے ہیں ہم اپنے وجدان کو اس لحاظ سے لنگر انداز کرتے ہیں کہ کسی نمبر کے کتنے ہندسے ہوتے ہیں اور لوگارتھمز صرف اس خیال کو حاصل کر رہے ہوتے ہیں اور درحقیقت، لوگارتھمز گزشتہ دنوں میں خاص دلچسپی کا باعث رہے ہیں۔ چند مہینوں میں دلچسپ بات یہ ہے کہ اگر آپ گوگل ٹرینڈز کے اس چارٹ کو دیکھیں جو صرف لوگاریتھمک پیمانے کی تلاش میں ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ لوگارتھمک اسکیل کی اصطلاح تلاش کر رہے ہیں، آپ دیکھیں گے کہ ستمبر 2019 سے فروری 2020 تک ایک محیطی دلچسپی موجود ہے اور کسی وجہ سے، اچانک عام لوگوں کی طرف سے لوگارتھمک اسکیل کو سمجھنے میں شدید دلچسپی پیدا ہوئی ہے، مجھے حیرت ہے کہ ایسا کیوں ہے؟ یہ ہے کہ؟ اور ہم اسے مارچ کے اوائل میں یا اس کے آس پاس بیٹھے ہوئے دیکھتے ہیں اور یقیناً یہ اس وقت ہے جب کورونا کی وبا واقعی تیز رفتاری سے شروع ہو رہی تھی اور ہر کوئی تیزی سے بڑھنے کو سمجھنا چاہتا تھا اور ایک عام طریقہ جس میں تیزی سے ترقی کی منصوبہ بندی کی جاتی ہے وہ ہے جو معلوم ہے۔ لوگارتھمک اسکیل کے طور پر اس لیے میں نے حقیقت میں اس کے بارے میں ایک ویڈیو بنائی اور اس میں میں کچھ اینیمیشنز بنا رہا تھا اور اس میں ایکسپونینشل گروتھ کے اس آئیڈیا اور مرکزی خیال کو واضح کرنا چاہتا تھا، میں آگے بڑھوں گا اور ایک مختلف اینیمیشن پر واپس جاؤں گا اگر آپ نمبروں کو ٹریک کر رہے ہیں، اس معاملے میں یہ مارچ تک کے مہینوں میں سرزمین چین سے باہر COVID-19 کے ریکارڈ شدہ کیسز کی تعداد تھی، آپ صرف یہ معلوم کر سکتے ہیں کہ مطلق نمبر کیا ہے لیکن جو نمونہ آپ کو ملے گا وہ یہ ہے۔ جیسے جیسے آپ ایک دن سے دوسرے دن جاتے ہیں، آپ کا رجحان بڑھتا جا رہا ہے یہ پہلے کی طرح تھوڑا سا ہے، ہم 10 کی طاقتیں ایک سے دوسرے قدم پر دیکھ رہے تھے، آپ کچھ مقدار سے اس طرح سے ضرب کر رہے ہیں جس طرح وائرس بڑھ رہا تھا۔ ایک دن سے دوسرے دن تک بہت مماثل تھا، آپ کسی مستقل سے ضرب نہیں لگا رہے ہیں لیکن اس صورت میں، دنوں کی اس ترتیب کے لیے، یہ تقریباً 1 تھا۔ 2 اس خطے میں، آپ کسی چیز سے ضرب کر رہے ہیں لہذا جب آپ اس کی منصوبہ بندی کر رہے ہیں، تو یہ اس کلاسک کفایتی وکر کی طرح نظر آتا ہے جو اوپر کی طرف مڑتا ہے اور مجھے بعض اوقات یہ دیکھنا مشکل ہو جاتا ہے کہ یہ کہاں جا رہا ہے یا مجموعی پیٹرن کیا ہے۔ ایک عام چال یہ ہے کہ اس y-axis کو دیکھنے کے بجائے جو لکیری طور پر بڑھتا ہے جیسا کہ یہاں میں 5k سے 10k، 10k سے 15k، 15k سے 20k تک جا رہا ہوں ہر قدم اضافی ہے، ہم اس کے بجائے 5000 کا اضافہ کر رہے ہیں a y-axis جہاں ہر قدم ضرب ہے لہذا آپ 10 سے 100، 100 سے 1000، 1000 سے 10، 10،000 تک جا رہے ہیں یہ سب 10 سے ضرب کرنے سے بڑھتے ہیں اور آپ جو کہہ سکتے ہیں وہ یہ ہے کہ y-axis اب سازش نہیں کر رہا ہے کیسز کی کل تعداد لیکن کیسز کی کل تعداد کا لوگارتھم اور یہ درحقیقت کسی پلاٹ پر دیکھنا آسان بنا دیتا ہے اگر آپ یہ بتانا چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ ٹرینڈ کیا کرے گا اور یہ کہنا ایک سادہ سا ماڈل ہے، اوہ یہ بالکل تیزی سے بڑھنے والا ہے لیکن اس طرح کی کسی چیز کے ابتدائی مراحل میں، یہ وہی ہے جس کی وجہ سے میں نے اس ویڈیو کے لیے بنائی گئی اینیمیشن میں تیزی سے آگے بڑھایا اور دلچسپ بات یہ ہے کہ اگر اس وقت واپس آ جائے تو مجھے لگتا ہے کہ میں نے اسے پوسٹ کیا ہے۔ 6 مارچ کو اگر آپ کو صرف بہترین فٹ کی ایک لائن ملی اور آپ نے اسے بڑھایا اور آپ نے کہا، وہ لائن کب ایک ملین کو عبور کرنے والی ہے؟ جس کی وجہ یہ ہے کہ y-axis ہر بار جب آپ قدم بڑھاتے ہیں تو ضرب کے مراحل کے ساتھ بڑھ رہا ہے، آپ 10 سے ضرب کر رہے ہیں، یہاں تک کہ اگر یہ 20,000 کیسز کی طرح لگتا ہے یا پھر یہ اس وقت واپس آ گیا تھا اس ملین سے بہت دور ہے جسے آپ جانتے ہیں، جب آپ لوگاریتھمک پیمانوں کو سمجھتے ہیں، تو درحقیقت ایسا نہیں لگتا تھا کہ یہ صرف 30 دن کی دوری پر ہے اگر آپ آسانی سے صرف اس لکیر کو کھینچ لیتے ہیں اور درحقیقت، 5 اپریل کے قریب تیزی سے آگے بڑھتے ہیں، جس وقت اس نے پیش گوئی کی ہو گی کہ ہم نے ایک ٹکر ماری تھی۔ چین سے باہر ملین کیسز بہت زیادہ اس دن ہوئے جب میرے خیال میں یہ ایک دن میں پلس یا مائنس ہوا، مجھے بالکل یاد نہیں ہے لیکن یہ اس محلے میں صحیح تھا کیونکہ مجھے یہ سوچنا یاد ہے کہ واہ یہ ویڈیو کے لیے ایک سادہ نمونہ تھا۔ استعمال کریں اور یہ چونکا دینے والی بات ہے کہ یہ بالکل مماثل ہے، شکر ہے کہ اس کے بعد سے، نمو تیزی سے رک گئی ہے، لہذا اگر آپ اسے لوگارتھمک پلاٹ پر دیکھیں تو، سیدھی لائن میں اوپر جانے کے بجائے، یہ ختم ہونا شروع ہو جاتا ہے لیکن، نقطہ ہونے کے بعد، کسی بھی وقت جب آپ فطرت میں یا یہاں تک کہ انسان کی بنائی ہوئی کسی چیز سے مل رہے ہوں جہاں فطری طور پر سوچنا فطری ہے کہ آپ کی مدد کے لیے لوگارتھمز میں اضافہ ہوتا ہے تو آئیے آگے بڑھیں اور سوچیں کہ یہ اصل میں کیا ہیں ان کی تعریف کیسے کی جاتی ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور دراصل ٹویٹر پر ہمارے شروع کرنے سے پہلے ایک سوال پوچھا گیا تھا کہ میرے خیال میں یہ بالکل ٹھیک ہے لہذا میکس 182 ہم سے پوچھتا ہے کہ اضافہ الٹا ہے گھٹاؤ ضرب الٹا تقسیم ہے لیکن میں کبھی بھی صحیح معنوں میں یہ نہیں سمجھ سکا کہ آیا ایکسپونیشن انورس nth-روٹنگ تھا یا لوگارتھمز اگر کوئی ایک ہے۔ ہو سکتا ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں کہ اگر کسی کو واقعی اس طرح کہا جا سکتا ہے، کیا وہ؟ یہ اتنا ہی شاندار سوال ہے، میکس اور میرے خیال میں یہ اس حقیقت پر اتر آتا ہے کہ اضافے اور ضرب کے ساتھ آپ نہیں ہیں، میں اسے آپ کے لیے نکال دوں گا درحقیقت یہ سب سے آسان ہوگا اگر ہمارے پاس کسی قسم کی کفایت شعاری ہو۔ ہم کہتے ہیں کہ 10 سے طاقت 3 کا تعلق 1000 کے برابر ہے یہاں تین مختلف اعداد ہیں جو 10، 3، اور 1000 کے درمیان تعلق کو ظاہر کر رہے ہیں اور اس کے علاوہ اسے ایک کفایت کنندہ کے ساتھ لکھنے کے دو اور طریقے ہیں جو ہم اسی تعلق کو لکھ سکتے ہیں۔ ہم یہ بھی کہہ سکتے ہیں کہ 1000 کا کیوب جڑ 10 کے برابر ہے یہ 1000 کو پوچھ رہا ہے، تیسرے نمبر پر کون سا نمبر بڑھا کر 1000 کے برابر ہے یہ اسی طرح ہے جو کیوب جڑ پوچھ رہا ہے اور ایک اور طریقہ سے آپ بالکل وہی بات کہہ سکتے ہیں یہ کہنا کہ 1000 کا لاگ بیس 10 3 تین مختلف اشارے کے برابر ہے، کچھ دیر پہلے میں نے یہ ویڈیو ایک متبادل ممکنہ اشارے کے بارے میں بنائی تھی جو اس خیال کو مرکز بنائے گی کہ آپ تین نمبروں کے درمیان اس تعلق کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں۔ مثلث جہاں آپ کے پاس ہمارے 10 نیچے بیٹھے ہوئے ہوں گے یہاں پاور سب سے اوپر بیٹھی ہے، 10 سے تیسری اور وہ چیز جو وہ برابر ہے نیچے دائیں طرف بیٹھے ہیں اور جب بھی آپ ان دو نمبروں کے درمیان کسی فنکشن یا آپریشن کے بارے میں بات کرنا چاہتے ہیں تو آپ اس بات کی نشاندہی کریں کہ آپ ان میں سے کس کو چھوڑ رہے ہیں تاکہ 10 کیوبڈ لکھیں، ہم 10 کو نیچے بائیں طرف 3 کو اوپری دائیں طرف شامل کریں گے، اور پھر ہم نیچے والے کو چھوڑ دیں گے تاکہ یہ اشارہ کر رہا ہے کہ ہم ایک لے رہے ہیں۔ طاقت، اس ریڈیکل کے لیے 10 کیوبڈ، آپ جو کہیں گے وہ یہ ہے کہ ہم جانتے ہیں کہ نیچے دائیں جانب کیا ہے کچھ طاقت کے برابر 1000 کے برابر ہے ہم یہ بھی جانتے ہیں کہ طاقت کیا چیز ہے جو کیوبڈ اس 1000 کے برابر ہے لیکن جو چیز ہم نہیں جانتے وہ نیچے کی ہے۔ بائیں یہ وہ معنی ہے جس میں ریڈیکلز ایکسپونینشن کے مخالف ہیں جہاں اگر چیز آپ کو معلوم نہیں ہے اس کے نیچے دائیں طرف ہونے کی بجائے نیچے بائیں طرف ہے لیکن لوگارتھمز کیا ہیں، یہ ایک اور معنوں میں الٹا ہے کیونکہ یہ کیا کہہ رہا ہے اس مثلث کے تعلق میں ہم بنیاد کو جانتے ہیں، یہ 10 ہے، ہمیں معلوم ہے کہ اسے کیا ہونا چاہیے، 1000 لیکن جو چیز ہم نہیں جانتے وہ یہ ہے کہ اس ایکسپوننٹ میں کیا ہے، اس لیے آپ کے سوال کا جواب دینے کے لیے شاید اور بھی مختصراً ہم کہہ سکتے ہیں کہ 10 سے x، اس کا الٹا الٹا لاگ بیس 10 ہے جسے آپ جانتے ہیں، y کا، کسی دوسرے متغیر کا جب کہ اگر آپ x کو 10ویں پر لے جا رہے ہیں، تو کچھ نامعلوم اس کا الٹا ہو جائے گا کسی دوسری قدر کی 10ویں جڑ اور مثلث پر یہ بنیادی طور پر یہ پوچھ رہا ہے کہ ہم کن چیزوں کو متغیر سمجھتے ہیں تو کیا آپ متغیر مقدار کے لیے نیچے کے دائیں حصے پر غور کر رہے ہیں، کیا آپ اس ٹاپ کو متغیر مقدار سمجھ رہے ہیں اور کیا ہے؟ نامعلوم لیکن مجھے یہ واضح کرنے کا یہ خیال بہت پسند آیا کہ ہمارے پاس ایک ہی حقیقت کے لیے تین بالکل مختلف اشارے ہیں ان میں سے ایک آپ ان نمبروں کی رشتہ دار پوزیشن استعمال کر رہے ہیں جن میں سے ایک ہم ایک نئی علامت متعارف کراتے ہیں، یہ ریڈیکل اور ان میں سے ایک ہم ایک نیا لفظ متعارف کروائیں، لاگ اس لیے ایک ہی خیال کو بتانے کے یہ تینوں مختلف طریقے غلط لگے اور اس لیے میں نے یہ ویڈیو ایک متبادل ممکنہ اشارے کے بارے میں بنائی اور جب کہ میں یہ ضروری نہیں سمجھتا کہ ہمیں اس مثلث کے ساتھ لوگارتھم سکھانا چاہیے کیونکہ کنونشن کیا ہے۔ اس لیے یہ بہتر ہے کہ لوگوں کو معمول کے اظہار کی عادت ڈالنا شروع کر دیا جائے کہ میں اس کے بارے میں کیا پسند کرتا ہوں اور اس کے ساتھ شروعات کرنا یہ ہے کہ جب آپ اس مثلث کو دیکھتے اور اس کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں تو یہ واقعی اس بات پر زور دیتا ہے کہ لاگ جو ہونا چاہتا ہے وہ ہر بار وہی ہے آپ کو کچھ قدر کا لاگ نظر آتا ہے آپ کو اپنے ذہن میں سوچنا چاہیے، ٹھیک ہے، یہ نمبر جو بھی ہے وہ واقعی ایک کفایت کنندہ بننا چاہتا ہے اور ہم اس کا مطلب مزید دیکھیں گے جیسے جیسے ہم ٹھیک ہوتے جائیں گے، تو ہر جب آپ لاگ دیکھتے ہیں تو یہ اس کی قیمت تین اور خاص طور پر یہ ایک کفایت کنندہ ہونا چاہیے جو اس ویڈیو کے پہلے حصے کے لیے کنونشن کے لحاظ سے اب جو بھی ہے اس کے اوپر بیٹھا ہوا ہونا چاہیے۔ لاگ بیس کے بغیر لاگ اس پر لکھا ہوا لاگ بیس 10 کا شارٹ ہینڈ ہوگا کیونکہ لاگ بیس 10 وہاں کی سب سے زیادہ بدیہی چیز ہوگی آپ کو معلوم ہونا چاہئے کہ اکثر ریاضی میں کنونشن یہ ہے کہ بغیر کسی چیز کے لاگ کا مطلب لاگ بیس ہوسکتا ہے اور ایک اور بھی ہے۔ قدرتی لاگ کے لیے اس ln کے لیے نوٹیشن ہم اگلی بار قدرتی لاگ کے بارے میں بات کرنے جا رہے ہیں اس لیے ابھی اس کے بارے میں زیادہ فکر نہ کریں اور ایک اور کنونشن بھی ہوتا ہے اگر آپ کمپیوٹر سائنس سیٹنگ لاگ میں ہوتے ہیں تو اس بات کی نشاندہی کرنے کے لیے شوگر شامل کی کہ لاگ بیس 2 کا مطلب کیا ڈیفالٹ ہے لہذا یہ بعض اوقات الجھن کا باعث بھی بن سکتا ہے لیکن یہ بنیادی طور پر اس بات پر منحصر ہے کہ آپ ریاضی میں کس نظم و ضبط میں ہیں، کیڑا نہیں، ریاضی والے لوگ واقعی ای کی بنیاد کو پسند کرتے ہیں۔ میں دیکھوں گا کہ اگلا لیکچر کیوں، مجھے نہیں معلوم، میں انجینئرنگ کہوں گا لیکن واقعی یہ وہ چیز ہے جہاں آپ ہمارے نارمل بیس 10 نمبر سسٹم لاگ کے ساتھ اچھی بصیرت چاہتے ہیں یعنی لاگ بیس 10 اور اگر آپ متجسس ہیں تو اکثر کمپیوٹر سائنس میں۔ ترتیبات لاگ بیس 2 ہر وقت سامنے آتا ہے، جیسا کہ میں نے کہا، آپ کے دماغ کے پچھلے حصے میں اگر آپ ان خصوصیات میں سے کچھ کے بارے میں سوچنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں صرف اس خیال پر کہ لاگ ان کے آخر میں صفر کی تعداد کو شمار کرتا ہے۔ وہ نمبر جو آپ کو بہت دور تک لے جا سکتا ہے اس لیے ہم ان خصوصیات میں سے ایک دو سے گزرنا شروع کرنے جا رہے ہیں اور میں یہ صرف عملی مثالوں کے ایک سیٹ کے ساتھ کرنا چاہتا ہوں تاکہ ہم قطب سے دور ہو جائیں اور اس بار پہلا مناسب سوال اور سوال آپ سے پوچھتا ہے کہ مندرجہ ذیل میں سے کون سا سچ ہے۔ 1000 گنا x کا لاگ x کے لاگ کے 3 گنا کے برابر ہے اور یاد رکھیں کہ ہم کنونشن استعمال کر رہے ہیں کہ یہ بیس لاگ بی ہے۔ 1000 گنا x کا لاگ x کیوبڈ c کے لاگ کے برابر ہے۔ 1000 گنا x کا لاگ 3 کے علاوہ x d کے لاگ کے برابر ہے۔ 1000 گنا x کا لاگ x اور e کے لاگ کی طاقت کے 3 کے برابر ہے۔ مندرجہ بالا میں سے کوئی بھی نہیں اور یاد رکھیں جیسا کہ میں نے پہلے کہا تھا کہ ہمیں پوری طرح سے توقع کرنی چاہئے کہ وہ تمام لوگ شروع میں جنہوں نے کہا کہ وہ لاگ کو اچھی طرح سمجھتے ہیں وہ فوری طور پر جواب دینے جا رہے ہیں، وہ صحیح جواب دینے جا رہے ہیں لیکن اگر آپ کوئی ایسا شخص جو ایسا نہیں کرتا ہے، اس سے آپ کو خوفزدہ نہ ہونے دیں جب آپ اس طرح کے مسئلے کو دیکھ رہے ہوں تو میں آپ کو صرف 10 کے مختلف پاورز میں پلگ ان کرنے کی ترغیب دوں گا اور اس خیال کے لحاظ سے سوچیں کہ لاگ فنکشن صفر کی تعداد شمار کرتا ہے اس لیے میں آپ کو اس کے بارے میں سوچنے کے لیے تھوڑا سا لمحہ دوں گا تاکہ میں آگے بڑھوں اور اس کی درجہ بندی کروں اور ہمیشہ کی طرح اگر یہ اس سے زیادہ تیز ہے جس میں آپ کو راحت ہے جان لیں کہ یہ صرف اس لیے ہے کہ میں آگے بڑھنا چاہتا ہوں۔ سبق کے ساتھ تو اس صورت میں صحیح جواب 1000 گنا x کا لاگ بنتا ہے اور 3 کے علاوہ x کا لاگ لینے کے مترادف ہے اور اب ایک لمحے کے لئے اس کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں اور جیسا کہ میں نے کہا تھا کہ جب آپ ابھی شروعات کر رہے ہیں ان کے ساتھ میرے خیال میں سب سے بہتر کام یہ ہے کہ مختلف نمبروں میں آسانی سے پلگ ان کریں اور پلگ ان کرنے کے لیے بہترین نمبر وہ ہیں جو پہلے ہی 10 کے پاورز ہیں لہذا اگر آپ 1000 گنا x کے لاگ جیسی کوئی چیز پوچھ رہے ہیں تو ٹھیک ہے نہیں جانتے، آئیے صرف 1000 گنا 100 کے ایکس لاگ کے لیے کچھ لگائیں، ہم جانتے ہیں کہ یہاں حتمی جواب میں کتنے صفر ہونے والے ہیں، 1000 ضرب 100، 100،000 ہے، ہمیں پہلے سے ہی بدیہی طور پر یہ خیال ہے کہ جب ہم 10 کی 2 قوتیں ضرب کرتے ہیں ہم صرف صفر لے رہے ہیں، اس 1000 سے 3 صفر اور اس 100 سے 2 صفر اور ہم انہیں ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ لگا رہے ہیں لہذا یہ 5 کل صفر ہونا چاہئے لیکن اگر آپ واقعی اس بات پر غور نہیں کرتے کہ نمبر کیسے بدلا باہر لیکن یہ اس طرح کیوں نکلا یہ اس 1000 میں سے 3 صفر کے علاوہ اس 100 میں سے 2 صفر تھے جسے ہم 1000 میں صفر کی تعداد اور 100 میں صفر کی تعداد کہہ کر بھی لکھ سکتے ہیں تو یہ خیال ہے کہ ایک لاگرتھم دو چیزوں کی پیداوار 10 کی طاقتوں کے تناظر میں ان دو چیزوں کے لوگارتھمز کا مجموعہ ہے جو صرف اس بات کو بتا رہی ہے کہ ہم میں سے بہت سے لوگوں کے لیے پہلے سے ہی ایک انتہائی بدیہی خیال ہے اگر آپ 10 کے 2 قوتیں لیتے ہیں اور آپ ان کو صرف آپ کو ضرب دیتے ہیں۔ ان کے تمام زیرو لیں اور انہیں ایک دوسرے پر گھسیٹیں تاکہ جس طرح میں نے یہاں چیزیں لکھی ہیں یہ دراصل قدرے عام حقیقت کی طرف اشارہ ہے جو ہماری لاگرتھم کی پہلی خاصیت ہوگی جو کہ اگر ہم A ٹائم B کا لاگ یہ A کے لاگ کے علاوہ B کے لاگ کے برابر ہوتا ہے اب جب بھی آپ ان لوگارتھم اصولوں میں سے کسی ایک کو دیکھتے ہیں اگر آپ خود کو آنکھیں پھیرتے ہوئے محسوس کرتے ہیں یا آپ تھوڑا سا الجھن میں ہیں کہ اسے کیسے یاد رکھا جائے بس مثالیں لگا دیں۔ میں بے کار ہو رہا ہوں، میں یہ بہت کچھ کہہ رہا ہوں لیکن اس کی وجہ یہ ہے کہ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ ایک بار جب آپ الجبرا میں ڈوب جائیں تو بھول جانا بہت آسان ہے اور آپ کسی قسم کے امتحان پر بیٹھے ہیں اور اس میں بہت ساری علامتیں ہیں۔ اپنے آپ کو یاد دلانے کے لیے آپ ٹھیک ہیں صرف کچھ نمبروں میں لگائیں جو کرنا ایک اچھی چیز ہے اور اکثر یہ بصیرت پیدا کرنے کا ایک بہترین طریقہ ہے لہذا اس معاملے میں، A ٹائم B کا لاگ کہنا اور اسے الگ کرنا ہم صرف سوچ سکتے ہیں، اوہ، وہ 100 گنا 1000 کا لاگ جو کہ 5 ہے، اس میں 5 صفر ہیں ہر دیئے گئے حصے میں زیرو کی تعداد کے لحاظ سے ٹوٹ جاتا ہے بہت اچھا، بہت اچھا ہے تو اس وجدان کو آگے بڑھاتے ہوئے آئیے ایک اور پریکٹس کا مسئلہ آزمائیں اور دوبارہ، اگر آپ کو معلوم ہے، بہت اچھا، آپ اس کا جواب ٹھیک سے دے پائیں گے لیکن شاید سوچیں، نہ صرف جواب کیا ہے بلکہ میں اس جواب کو کسی کو کیسے سمجھاؤں گا یا میں کس طرح کوشش کروں گا کہ کسی طالب علم کو مجھے بتائے بغیر خود ہی اس جواب پر آ جائے۔ ان کا جواب کیا ہے تو سامعین کے دو ممکنہ ارکان ہیں جو خود سبق میں دلچسپی رکھتے ہیں اور پھر وہ لوگ جو میٹا اسباق میں دلچسپی رکھتے ہیں تو ہمارا سوال دوبارہ پوچھتا ہے، مندرجہ ذیل میں سے کون سا سچ ہے؟ a n سے x کا لاگ x b کے n بار لاگ کے برابر ہے۔ n سے x کا لاگ ان پاور n c کے x کے لاگ کے برابر ہے۔ n سے x کا لاگ برابر ہے n جمع لاگ x یا d کے۔ x کا log n کے log کے برابر ہے x کے n اوقات کے لاگ کے یا اوپر میں سے کوئی بھی نہیں تو دوبارہ، جواب دینے کے لیے ایک لمحہ لگائیں جیسا کہ لوگ جواب دیتے ہیں، ہم انہیں رول ان ہوتے دیکھنا شروع کر دیں گے اور اگر آپ سوچنے میں دشواری کر رہے ہیں جہاں سے شروع کرنا ہے صرف 10 کی کچھ طاقتوں میں پلگ ان کریں اور دیکھیں کہ اس سے آپ کو کیا بصیرت حاصل ہو سکتی ہے، تو ایسا لگتا ہے کہ تقریباً ہر کوئی ایک خاص جواب پر اتر رہا ہے امید ہے کہ یہ صحیح جواب ہے، جیسا کہ میں نے کہا، سبھی توقع ہے تو آئیے آگے بڑھیں اور دیکھیں کہ آیا ہماری اکثریت درست نکلی اور انہوں نے ایسا کیا!",

  "input": "none of the above and remember like I said earlier we should fully expect that all of those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well they're going to be answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly but if you're someone who doesn't, don't let that intimidate you when you're looking at a problem like this one what I would encourage you to do is just plug in various powers of 10 and think in terms of the idea that the log function counts the number of zeros so I'll give you a little moment to think about that so I'll go ahead and grade it and as always if that's faster than what you're comfortable with know that it's only because I want to proceed forward with the lesson so in this case the correct answer comes out to be log of 1000 times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x and now let's think about that for a moment and like I said when you're just getting started with them I think the best thing to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers and the best numbers to plug in are the ones that are already powers of 10 so if you're asking something like log of 1000 times x well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x log of 1000 times 100 well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here well 1000 times 100 is 100,000 we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10 we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000 the 2 zeros from that 100 and we're putting them next to each other so it should be 5 total zeros but if you really reflect not just on how did the number turn out but why did it turn out that way it was the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100 which we could also write by saying the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100 so this idea that a logarithm of the product of two things is the sum of the logarithms of those two things in the context of powers of 10 that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive idea for a lot of us if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them you just take all of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other so the way I've written things out here it's actually indicative of a slightly more general fact which is going to be our very first property of logarithms which is that if we take the log of A times B it equals the log of A plus the log of B now any time you see one of these logarithm rules if you find yourself squinting your eyes or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it just plug in examples I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot but it's because I think it's very easy to forget once you're swamped in the algebra itself and you're sitting on some kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols to remind yourself you are okay to just plug in some numbers that's a fine thing to do and often it's a great way to yield intuition so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart we could just think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000 which is 5, there's 5 zeros in it breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part great, wonderful so carrying that intuition further let's try another practice problem and again, if you know it, great, you'll be able to answer it fine but maybe think, not just what is the answer but how would I explain this answer to someone or how would I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own without me having to tell them what the answer is so there's two potential audience members there's those who are interested in the lesson itself and then those who are interested in the meta lesson so our question asks, again, which of the following is true?",

  "input": "so the correct answer here is a, which it looks like 4,000 of you got congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x so, again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself I think a fine place to start is plugging something in and in this case, for log of x to the power n let's just try it with 100 to the power 3 and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way sometimes one example will do because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking well, that's 3 copies of 100 I'm taking 3 copies of 100 and when I multiply all that out and I think of log as counting the number of zeros we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100 I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together to get a million so this number is going to be 6 but if we think actually why was it 6 not just that's the number of zeros inside the million where that 6 came from is that we had 3 copies of that 100 and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros so that way it's a more general way you can think about it where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking at 1000 cubed or 1000 to the n or x to the power n you can think that it's whatever that value of n was the number of copies we were multiplying in times the number of well, let's see, it's not x times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted for x which in this case was 100 so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 to the power n this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000 counting the number of zeros in each one of them which is 4 so it would be n times 4 and of course the general property that most of you correctly answered is that you have this lovely little effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power that little power hops down in front of it and you just have log of what was on the inside now one of the maybe most important implications of that I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition if I'm taking log and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10 of 10 to the power n we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10 which is of course 1 this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at the end or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10 and the answer is simply 1 which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n oh well the answer is n ok now with every given logarithm property that we have so in this case we just found one log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves a little bit of intuition for these so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here try to hide where we're going what we just found raising something to the n that hops in front this corresponds to the exponential property that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms which is they kind of they're like exponentiation turned inside out and here's what I mean by that the thing sitting on the inside of the log if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for something that's exponential in this case the a the thing on the inside corresponds to 10 to the x the output of the function whereas the entire thing itself the log of a corresponds to what's on the inside over here just what's the exponent of the 10 so wherever you see a log expression here you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side and every time you see an exponential the entire 10 to the x expression the whole outer component on the right side that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs and we saw this above the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside that's adding on the outside well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out that's telling us that multiplying on the outside multiplying the outputs of the function is the same as adding on the inside because each of these logs like log a and log b is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right so with that let's keep playing let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for so this last one, very nice thinking of exponents hopping down the next one is something that might look a little bit weird to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it and we'll give it a little bit more a moment to pull up which of the following is true?",

چلیں کہ آپ اسے سکھانے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں کسی کے ساتھ یا اگر آپ اس بات کو سمجھنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں کہ اس کا کیا مطلب ہے اپنے آپ کو میرے خیال میں شروع کرنے کے لیے ایک اچھی جگہ کچھ لگانا ہے اور اس صورت میں، x کے پاور پر لاگ کے لیے n آئیے اسے صرف 100 سے پاور کے ساتھ آزماتے ہیں۔ 3 اور آپ دوسرے لوگوں کے ساتھ یہ دیکھنے کے لیے کوشش کر سکتے ہیں کہ کیا آپ جو نمونے کر رہے ہیں وہ واقعی کام کر رہے ہیں لیکن اگر آپ اسے صرف یہ دیکھنے کے لحاظ سے نہیں سوچ رہے ہیں کہ جواب کیا ہے بلکہ یہ سوچنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں کہ جواب اس طرح کیوں نکلا۔ کبھی کبھی ایک مثال یہ کرے گی کیونکہ 100 کیوبڈ، ہم اسے اچھی طرح سے لینے کے طور پر سوچ سکتے ہیں، یہ 100 کی 3 کاپیاں ہیں میں 100 کی 3 کاپیاں لے رہا ہوں اور جب میں ان سب کو ضرب دیتا ہوں اور میں لاگ کے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں کہ ہم صفر کی تعداد گنتے ہیں۔ کہو، اوہ، یہ کوئی ایسا نمبر بننے والا ہے جس پر صرف 6 صفر ہوں، اس کا مطلب 100 گنا 100 گنا 100 لینے کا ہے، میں صرف ان تمام صفروں کو ایک ساتھ ملا کر ایک ملین حاصل کرنے کے بارے میں سوچ سکتا ہوں تو یہ نمبر ہونے جا رہا ہے۔ 6 لیکن اگر ہم حقیقت میں سوچیں کہ یہ 6 کیوں نہیں تھا صرف ملین کے اندر صفر کی تعداد ہے جہاں سے یہ 6 آیا ہے کہ ہمارے پاس اس 100 کی 3 کاپیاں تھیں اور ان 100 میں سے ہر ایک کے پاس 2 مختلف صفر تھے اس طرح یہ زیادہ عام ہے۔ جس طرح سے آپ اس کے بارے میں سوچ سکتے ہیں کہ اگر ہم 100 کیوبڈ لینے کے بجائے 1000 کیوبڈ یا 1000 کو n یا x کو پاور n دیکھ رہے ہوں تو آپ سوچ سکتے ہیں کہ یہ جو بھی ہے n کی وہ قیمت تھی جو ہم ان کاپیوں کی تعداد کو ضرب دے رہے تھے۔ کنویں کی تعداد، آئیے دیکھتے ہیں، یہ صفر کی تعداد کا x گنا نہیں ہے جو ہم نے x کے بدلے جو کچھ بھی کیا اس میں تھا جو اس معاملے میں 100 تھا، لہذا اگر میں اس کے بجائے 10،000 کے لاگ جیسی چیز کو پاور میں لیتا تو یہ وہی ہوتا جیسا کہ اس 10,000 کی n کاپیاں لیتے ہوئے ان میں سے ہر ایک میں صفر کی تعداد گنتے ہیں جو کہ 4 ہے تو یہ n گنا 4 ہوگا اور یقیناً عام خاصیت جس کا آپ میں سے اکثر نے صحیح جواب دیا ہے وہ یہ ہے کہ آپ پر یہ خوبصورت چھوٹا اثر ہے جہاں آپ کسی ایسی چیز کا لاگ دیکھیں جو ایک طاقت کی طرف اٹھتا ہے کہ تھوڑی سی طاقت اس کے سامنے آتی ہے اور آپ کے پاس صرف اس کا لاگ ان ہوتا ہے جو اندر موجود تھا اب اس کے سب سے اہم مضمرات میں سے ایک میں نہیں جانتا کہ آپ اسے کال کریں گے یا نہیں۔ ایک مفہوم یا اگر آپ اسے تعریف کا دوبارہ بیان کہیں گے اگر میں لاگ لے رہا ہوں اور میں صرف اس بات پر دوبارہ زور دوں گا کہ اس کی بنیاد 10 میں سے 10 طاقت ہے n ہم اس چھوٹے سے n کے بارے میں سوچ سکتے ہیں سامنے اور یہ 10 میں سے لاگ بیس 10 کا n گنا بن جاتا ہے جو یقیناً 1 یہ اظہار ہے جس کے بارے میں آپ سوچ سکتے ہیں کہ یا تو آخر میں صفر کی تعداد گننا ہے یا عام طور پر یہ 10 سے پوچھ رہا ہے کہ 10 کیا ہے اور جواب صرف 1 ہے۔ جو کہ بہت تسلی بخش ہے کیونکہ ایک اور طریقہ جس سے آپ واپس جا سکتے ہیں اور صرف اس اصل اظہار کو پڑھ سکتے ہیں وہ ہے 10 کو جو 10 کے برابر ہے n اوہ ٹھیک ہے جواب ٹھیک ہے اب ہر دی گئی لاگرتھم پراپرٹی کے ساتھ جو ہمارے پاس ہے اس معاملے میں ہم ابھی صرف x کا ایک لاگ ان پاور n میں ملا ہے جس میں یہ شامل ہے کہ n کے سامنے جھکنا ہمیشہ ایک آئینہ دار امیج ایکسپوینیشنل پراپرٹی ہوتا ہے اور یہ ایک اور طریقہ ہے جس سے ہم ان کے لئے اپنے آپ کو تھوڑا سا بصیرت حاصل کرنے میں مدد کرسکتے ہیں لہذا مجھے صرف احاطہ کرنے دو کچھ مستقبل کی خصوصیات جو ہم یہاں حاصل کرنے جا رہے ہیں اس کو چھپانے کی کوشش کریں کہ ہم کہاں جا رہے ہیں جو ہم نے ابھی n کے سامنے کچھ بڑھاتے ہوئے پایا ہے یہ اس کفایتی خاصیت کے مساوی ہے کہ اگر میں x پر 10 لیتا ہوں اور بڑھاتا ہوں طاقت n تک یہ پوری چیز 10 کو n اوقات x میں لینے کے مترادف ہے اور یہ ہمیں ایک اور وجدان کی طرف لے جاتا ہے جو آپ کے لوگارتھمز کے لئے ہو سکتا ہے جو کہ وہ اس طرح ہیں جیسے اندر سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے اور یہاں میرا مطلب ہے کہ جو چیز لاگ کے اندر بیٹھی ہے اگر میں ایک کا لاگ لے رہا ہوں تو آپ کو یہ سوچنا چاہیے کہ کسی چیز کے لیے مکمل بیرونی اظہار ہے جو اس معاملے میں اس کے اندر کی چیز 10 سے x کے مساوی ہے فنکشن کا آؤٹ پٹ جبکہ پوری چیز کا لاگ ان کے اندر موجود چیز سے مطابقت رکھتا ہے یہاں صرف 10 کا ایکسپیننٹ کیا ہے لہذا جہاں بھی آپ کو لاگ ایکسپریشن نظر آئے آپ کو یہ سوچنا چاہیے کہ یہ دائیں جانب ایک ایکسپیننٹ کا کردار ادا کرتا ہے۔ سائیڈ اور ہر بار جب آپ ایکس ایکسپریشن تک پورے 10 کو ایکس ایکسپریشن دیکھتے ہیں تو دائیں طرف کا پورا بیرونی جزو جو کسی لاگ کے اندر بیٹھی ہوئی کسی چیز سے مطابقت رکھتا ہے اور ہم نے اسے اس خیال کے اوپر دیکھا کہ جب ہم ضرب کر رہے ہیں اندر کی طرف جو باہر سے اچھی طرح سے اضافہ کر رہا ہے اگر لاگز قسم کے ٹرن ایکسپووننشلز کے اندر باہر جو ہمیں بتا رہا ہے کہ فنکشن کے آؤٹ پٹس کو باہر سے ضرب دینا اندر سے اضافہ کرنے جیسا ہی ہے کیونکہ ان میں سے ہر ایک لاگ جیسے لاگ اے اور لاگ بی دائیں طرف کے ایکسپریشن میں x اور y کا کردار ادا کر رہا ہے تو اس کے ساتھ چلتے رہیں آئیے ان میں سے صرف ایک دو مزید کرتے ہیں اور دیکھتے ہیں کہ ان میں سے کتنی خصوصیات ہیں جن کے لیے ہم اس آخری کے لیے ایک وجدان پیدا کر سکتے ہیں، ایکسپونینٹس کو اگلے ایک کو نیچے اتارنے کے بارے میں بہت اچھی سوچ ایک ایسی چیز ہے جو ان لوگوں کو تھوڑی عجیب لگ سکتی ہے جو ضروری طور پر لوگارتھمز سے واقف نہیں ہیں لیکن دوبارہ، اس کے بارے میں کچھ بصیرت حاصل کرنے کے لیے کچھ نمبروں کو پلگ کریں اور ہم اسے تھوڑا سا دیں گے۔ مندرجہ ذیل میں سے کون سا سچ ہے؟ لاگ بیس اے بی کا منفی لاگ بیس ہے اے لاگ بیس کا بی ہے 1 کو لاگ بیس سے تقسیم کیا جائے گا لاگ بیس کا بی ہے 1 مائنس لاگ بیس بی کا لاگ بیس بی اے کا لاگ بیس اے ہے 1 کا مندرجہ بالا میں سے b یا کسی سے بھی تقسیم کیا گیا ہے لہذا یہ پوچھ رہا ہے کہ کیا ہوتا ہے جب ہم لوگارتھم کے اندر بیٹھے ہوئے کے ساتھ بیس کو تبدیل کرتے ہیں اور میں آپ کو جواب دینے کے لئے صرف ایک یا دو منٹ دوں گا کہ ٹھیک ہے، لہذا ایسا لگتا ہے کہ جوابات میں کچھ قسم کے ہیں وہاں مستحکم ہے تو آئیے آگے بڑھیں اور چیزوں کو گریڈ کریں اور اس معاملے میں، ہمارے پاس جو انتخاب ہیں ان کا صحیح جواب b یہ نکلتا ہے کہ b کے لاگ بیس a میں 1 کو a کے لاگ بیس b سے تقسیم کرنا شامل ہے، آئیے سوچتے ہیں۔ یہ ایک مثال کے لحاظ سے اور پھر ایک زیادہ ثبوت کے لحاظ سے، منظم وجہ کے لحاظ سے کیوں کہ یہ سچ ہونا چاہئے لہذا اگر ہم اپنے اڈوں کو تبدیل کر رہے ہیں تو آئیے اپنے اچھے پرانے دوست لاگ بیس 10 کے ساتھ شروعات کریں اور آئیے ایک اچھا پلگ ان کریں۔ 10 کی طاقت 1000 کی طرح صفر کی تعداد گنتی ہے، ہمیں 3 ملتا ہے تو آئیے بیسز کو تبدیل کرنے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں اور دیکھتے ہیں کہ اس کا کیا مطلب ہونا چاہیے لاگ بیس 1000 کا 10 ٹھیک ہے، ٹھیک ہے یہ کیا پوچھ رہا ہے؟ ہوسکتا ہے کہ آپ ایک چھوٹا سا مثلث کھینچنے کے بارے میں سوچیں جیسے ہم جانتے ہیں کہ 1000 کسی چیز کے برابر 10 1000 کے برابر ہے اور کیا 10 کے برابر ہے؟ ٹھیک ہے، اگر 10 کیوبڈ 1000 ہے تو یہ وہی چیز ہے جو کہ 10 کے برابر ہے 1000 کو 1 تہائی تک بڑھا کر یہاں الٹا کرنے میں ایکسپوننٹ کا ضرب الٹا شامل ہے اور جس طرح سے باہر نکلتا ہے وہ یہ ہے کہ یہ 1 کو 3 سے تقسیم کرنے کی طرح لگتا ہے۔ اور یہ کہ 3 لاگ بیس 10 کے 1000 سے مساوی ہے یہ 1 کو 1000 کے لاگ بیس 10 سے تقسیم کیا گیا ہے لہذا عام طور پر، آپ اس واحد مثال کی بنیاد پر اندازہ لگا سکتے ہیں کہ جب ہم بیس کو اندر کی چیز سے تبدیل کرتے ہیں تو یہ 1 تقسیم کرنے کے مساوی ہوتا ہے۔ وہاں کے باہر کیا ہے اور بار بار، آپ اس سے متعلقہ قاعدے کو دیکھنے کے لحاظ سے سوچ سکتے ہیں کہ اب میرے پیارے چھوٹے لاگ اور ایکسپوننشیل کا کیا ہوا؟ بہت اچھا تو، آئیے ایک بار پھر چھپائیں جہاں کچھ چیزیں کچھ دوسری خصوصیات ہیں جو ہم یہاں حاصل کریں گے اور میں اسے اسی ترتیب میں رکھوں گا جس ترتیب سے میرے پاس یہاں پہلے تھا میں سوچ رہا تھا کہ پہلے سے لکھے جانے سے میں رکھ سکتا ہوں معمول سے تھوڑا سا صاف ستھرا لیکن شاید اس میں کاغذ کاٹنے کا یہ عجیب و غریب کھیل کھیلنا شامل ہے لہذا ہم نے ابھی کیا پایا ہے، a کا لاگ بیس اگر آپ ان کو تبدیل کرتے ہیں، تو یہ 1 سے تقسیم کرنے کے مترادف ہے، جس سے یہ مساوی ہے۔ کفایتی زمین ہے اگر آپ b کو کسی طاقت پر لے جائیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ وہ a کے برابر ہے یہ وہی بیان ہے جیسا کہ کہا جاتا ہے کہ a سے الٹا اس طاقت کے دوبارہ برابر ہو جاتا ہے، یہ ایک لمحہ نکالنا اور لوگارتھم کو چیزوں کو تبدیل کرنے کے طور پر سوچنا مفید ہے۔ a کا ایکسپریشن لاگ بیس بی اندر سے اس x کا کردار ادا کر رہا ہے اور b کا ایکسپریشن لاگ بیس a اس کا کردار ادا کر رہا ہے جو بھی a کے اوپر بیٹھا ہے اور پھر ہم آہنگی سے، پاور x کا پورا اظہار b ادا کر رہا ہے۔ بائیں طرف اندر کا کردار، یہ a اور پورے اظہار کا کردار ادا کرتا ہے، a سے کسی چیز کی طاقت اس کا کردار ادا کرتی ہے جو لاگ بیس کے اندر بیٹھی ہے a تاکہ آپ دیکھ سکیں، صرف کچھ مثالوں میں پلگ ان کرکے اور اس کو ایکسپونینشنل رولز سے ہم آہنگ کرتے ہوئے ہم پہلے ہی تین مختلف لوگارتھم کے اصولوں کے بارے میں سوچ سکتے ہیں جنہیں اگر آپ جانتے ہیں کہ الجبرا کے ٹکڑوں کے طور پر ان کو حفظ کرنے کے لیے دے دیا جاتا، تو آپ انہیں حفظ کر سکتے ہیں لیکن ان کے لیے یہ بہت آسان ہے کہ آپ ان سے باہر نکل جائیں۔ سر اور ہاتھ میں کام سے مایوس ہونا بھی بہت آسان ہے لیکن آپ اپنے آپ کو یاد دلانا چاہیں گے کہ ہمیں اس قسم کی چیزوں کی پرواہ کرنے کی وجہ سے لوگارتھمز کے اصولوں کو سمجھنا ہمیں ان سیاق و سباق میں ریاضی کرنے میں مدد کرتا ہے جہاں یہ وائرس کی طرح بڑھتا ہے جہاں ایک دن سے دوسرے دن، ایک قدم سے دوسرے قدم تک، چیزیں ضرب سے بڑھنے لگتی ہیں لوگارتھمز کے اصولوں کو سمجھنا آپ کو اس قسم کی چیزوں کے بارے میں بہتر احساس دلانے میں مدد کرتا ہے لہذا اس سے پہلے کہ ہم ایک اچھی حقیقی دنیا کی مثال پیش کریں کہ یہ کیا نظر آتا ہے۔ جیسا کہ میں اس رگ میں صرف ایک اور کوئز سوال کرتا ہوں کہ لوگارتھمز کی خصوصیات کے بارے میں ایک آخری سوال پوچھوں اس سے پہلے کہ ہم ایک حقیقی دنیا کی مثال کی طرف منتقل ہو جائیں اس سے چھٹکارا حاصل کریں جو ہمارے یہاں تھا اور اب، مندرجہ ذیل میں سے کون سا سچ ہے؟ اے پلس بی کا لاگ ایک پلس بی کے لاگ کے پلس لاگ کے برابر ہے ایک پلس بی کے بی لاگ کے بار لاگ کے برابر ہے پلس بی کے پلس لاگ کے لاگ سے تقسیم کرنے کے برابر ہے یا اے جمع بی کا لاگ برابر ہے ایک بار کے لاگ کے لاگ سے تقسیم کیا گیا بی یا اوپر میں سے کوئی بھی نہیں، اور اب ہمارے پاس اتنا اتفاق نہیں ہے، کیا ہم؟ بہت دلچسپ، ہمارے پاس دو کے درمیان گھوڑوں کی دوڑ ہے لہذا میں آپ کو اس کے بارے میں سوچنے کے لئے ایک لمحہ دوں گا جب لوگ جواب دے رہے ہیں، اصل میں میرے پاس سامعین کے لئے ایک چھوٹا سا سوال ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں صرف اس بارے میں بات کر رہا تھا کہ ہم کیسے ضرب نمو کے لحاظ سے سوچیں اور اس کے لیے صرف دس کی طاقتیں ہی نہیں ہونی چاہئیں، ہم تین کی طاقتوں جیسا کچھ بھی کر سکتے ہیں جہاں آپ ایک سے تین سے نو سے ستائیس سے اکیاسی تک جا رہے ہیں، سبھی ان میں سے ہم یہ کہہ سکتے ہیں کہ ان نمبروں میں سے لاگ بیس تین صرف اچھے چھوٹے قدموں میں بڑھتا ہے لہذا لاگ بیس تین میں سے ایک، تین سے جو ایک کے برابر ہے، جواب صفر ہے عام طور پر ایک کا لاگ، چاہے بیس ہی کیوں نہ ہو صفر لاگ بیس تین میں سے تین، تین سے جو تین کے برابر ہے اسی طرح لاگ بیس تین میں سے نو دو آہ ہے، آپ حیران ہوں گے کہ میرا سوال کیا ہے، لیکن اس سے ان سب کو نکالنے میں مدد ملے گی اور میری اپنی خوشی کے لیے یہاں، میں صرف ایک اور لاگ بیس لکھتا ہوں کہ اکیاسی میں سے تین اب چار ہے، میں نے سنا ہے کہ بظاہر اگر آپ کسی بچے سے پوچھتے ہیں، تو چلو پانچ یا چھ سال کے لگ بھگ بتاتے ہیں کہ ایک اور نو کے درمیان نصف نمبر کیا ہے؟ بتائیں کہ کون سا نمبر آدھے راستے پر ہے جواب دینے کے لیے ان کی جبلتیں لوگاریتھمک ہیں جبکہ ہماری جبلتیں زیادہ لکیری ہوتی ہیں لہذا ہم اکثر ایک اور نو سوچتے ہیں، آپ کو ان کے درمیان یکساں فاصلہ والے نمبروں کا ایک گروپ مل گیا ہے دو، تین، چار، پانچ، چھ سات، آٹھ اور اگر آپ درمیان میں آدھے راستے پر چلتے ہیں، تو آپ پانچ پر اتریں گے لیکن اگر آپ ضرب کی ترقی کے لحاظ سے سوچ رہے ہیں کہ ایک سے نو تک کہاں پہنچنا ہے، تو یہ چیزوں کا ایک گروپ شامل کرنے کی بات نہیں ہے لیکن آپ 'ایک خاص مقدار سے بڑھ رہے ہیں جو آپ تین کے عنصر سے بڑھتے ہیں، پھر آپ تین کے ایک اور عنصر سے بڑھتے ہیں، ایک بچے کی فطری جبلت تین کہنے کے ساتھ ملتی ہے اور قیاس یہ بھی ہے کہ اگر آپ کے پاس ایسے معاشروں کا مطالعہ کرنے والے ماہر بشریات ہیں جو t نے اکاؤنٹنگ سسٹم اور تحریر کو اسی طرح تیار کیا جس طرح جدید معاشروں کے پاس ہے وہ اس کے تین جواب دیں گے لہذا، سامعین کے لیے میرا سوال اگر آپ میں سے کوئی جو اس وقت دیکھ رہا ہے تو اسے ایک چھوٹے بچے تک رسائی حاصل ہے، آئیے کہہ لیں، پانچ سال کی حد میں۔ بوڑھے دیکھیں کہ کیا آپ ان سے پوچھ سکتے ہیں کہ ایک اور نو کے درمیان نصف نمبر کون سا ہے اور اگر آپ کر سکتے ہیں تو ہمیں ٹویٹر پر بتائیں کہ بچہ کیا کہتا ہے اس کا اصل جواب کیا ہے کیونکہ مجھے نہیں معلوم کیوں، میں تھوڑا سا ہوں۔ اس کے بارے میں شکوک و شبہات ہیں کہ آیا یہ عملی طور پر ختم ہو گیا ہے میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ ایسا کرنے کا یہ کوئی انتہائی سائنسی طریقہ نہیں ہے میں یوٹیوب لائیو سٹریم دیکھنے والے لوگوں سے اپنے بچوں کا سروے کرنے اور پھر جواب ٹویٹ کرنے کے لیے نہیں کہہ رہا ہوں لیکن میرے لیے یہ دلچسپ ہوگا۔ ہمارے سوال پر کسی قسم کی توثیق کو دیکھنے کے لیے یہ پہلا سوال ہے جس میں ایک سمت میں بہت زیادہ اتفاق رائے نہیں ہوتا ہے، آئیے آگے بڑھیں اور اس کی درجہ بندی کریں کہ کیا جواب بہت اچھا نکلا، ٹھیک ہے، تو 2,400 آپ میں سے صحیح جواب دیا کہ یہ اوپر میں سے کوئی بھی نہیں ہے کہ پلس بی کا لاگ ان اچھی خاصیتوں میں سے کسی کو بھی پورا نہیں کرتا ہے اور عام طور پر، جب تک کہ ہم مخصوص قسم کے تخمینے کے ساتھ کام کرنے جا رہے ہیں خاص طور پر جب قدرتی لاگ عمل میں آتا ہے۔ ہم اگلی بار اس کے بارے میں بات کر سکتے ہیں لوگارتھم کے ان پٹس کو شامل کرنا درحقیقت ایک بہت ہی عجیب احساس ہے یہ کرنا ایک بہت ہی عجیب چیز ہے اور اس عجیب و غریب پن کا احساس حاصل کرنے کے لیے، اگر میں آپ سے پلس بی کا لاگ ان کرنے کے لیے کہوں تو دس کی کچھ طاقتیں لگائیں۔ آپ کیا سوچنا شروع کر سکتے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے، مجھے صرف 10،000 اور 100 جیسی مثالیں لگانے دیں اور میں اپنے آپ سے پوچھتا ہوں، اگر میں یہ صفر گنتی کا فنکشن کروں گا کہ اس ان پٹ میں کیا ہے اس میں کتنے زیرو ہیں؟ لیکن یہ عجیب ہے، کیونکہ جب ہم 10,100 کو اچھی طرح سے شامل کرتے ہیں، تو ہم دس کی کلین پاور پر نہیں رہتے اور ٹھیک ہے، یہ ٹھیک ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، اکثر آپ ایسی چیزوں کے لوگارتھمز لے رہے ہوتے ہیں جو دس کی صاف طاقت نہیں ہوتیں لیکن یہ بن جاتا ہے۔ یہ پوچھنا بہت عجیب ہے کہ آپ اسے 100 کے لاگ کے لحاظ سے کیسے بیان کرتے ہیں جو دو تھا اور 10,000 کا لاگ جو چار تھا کیونکہ اگر آپ 10,100 کے لاگ کو دیکھیں تو یہ دس سے پوچھ رہا ہے جو 10,100 کے برابر ہے آپ کہہ سکتے ہیں، میں نہیں کرتا نہیں معلوم، یہ چار سے تھوڑا اوپر ہونے والا ہے کیونکہ یہ 10,000 کے قریب ہے لہذا آپ یہاں سب سے بہتر اندازہ لگا سکتے ہیں، اوہ، یہ کچھ ایسا ہونے والا ہے جو 10،000 کے لاگ کی طرح ہے لیکن یہ محض ایک اتفاق کی طرح محسوس ہوتا ہے۔ ان دو نمبروں کی بنیاد پر جو ہم نے ڈالے ہیں وہاں آنے کی کوئی اچھی منظم وجہ نہیں ہے لہذا شاید آپ اندازہ لگائیں، اوہ، اگر نمبر a اور b بہت مختلف ہیں تو یہ ان میں سے زیادہ سے زیادہ کے قریب ہے لیکن یہ بہت ہی عجیب ہے اور سب سے اہم بات، کوئز کی خاطر اگر آپ صرف ان آپشنز کو دیکھیں جو یہ آپ کو دے رہا ہے اگر آپ اسے کسی خاص نمبر کے ساتھ آزماتے ہیں، تو آپ کو معلوم ہوگا کہ ان میں سے کوئی بھی کام نہیں کرتا، سب اچھا ہے کبھی کبھی آپ کو کچھ مل جاتا ہے۔ ایسا لگتا ہے کہ یہ ایک اچھی پراپرٹی بننے جا رہی ہے لیکن یہ ایک اچھی پراپرٹی نہیں بنتی ہے اور میں یہ بھی سمجھتا ہوں کہ یہ صرف اپنے آپ کو تلاش کرنے کے بجائے صرف مختلف کے ساتھ کام کرنے کی بجائے اہم ہے، آپ جانتے ہو، لاگ آف اے ٹائم بی یا لاگ آف ایکس طاقت میں ان چیزوں کا جن کا ایک اچھا اصول ہے کبھی کبھی آپ ریاضی کے جنگل میں ہوتے ہیں، آپ کسی ایسے مسئلے پر کام کر رہے ہیں جس میں آپ کے پاس لاگرتھم کا اظہار ہے اور یہ ان پٹ میں چیزیں شامل کر رہا ہے اور آپ اس سے واقفیت حاصل کرنا چاہتے ہیں۔ حقیقت یہ ہے کہ یہ عجیب قسم کی بات ہے کہ آپ آسان نہیں کر پائیں گے لیکن اگر آپ، آپ جانتے ہیں، اگر آپ نے اس کے بارے میں سوچا ہی نہیں ہوتا تو آپ حیران ہوسکتے ہیں، اوہ، کیا کوئی ایسا فارمولا ہے جو میرے پاس نہیں ہے؟ اس سب کے ساتھ پہلے دیکھا گیا، میں آگے بڑھتا ہوں اور سامعین سے ایک دو سوالات کرتا ہوں اس سے پہلے کہ ہم کسی مختلف قسم کی مثال کی طرف منتقل ہو جائیں تو ایسا لگتا ہے کہ اوما شرما پوچھتی ہیں کہ کیا بنیاد صفر ہو سکتی ہے؟ یہ ایک دلچسپ سوال ہے ٹھیک ہے، کیا لوگارتھم کی بنیاد صفر ہو سکتی ہے؟ اچھی طرح سے ہمارے مثلث کے لحاظ سے ہم اس کے بارے میں سوچ سکتے ہیں جیسا کہ آپ جانتے ہیں، صفر سے کسی قسم کی طاقت x کسی دوسری قدر کے برابر ہے y یہ وہ چیز ہے جسے ہم یا تو صفر کو x کے برابر y کہہ کر لکھ سکتے ہیں یا ہم لکھ سکتے ہیں۔ ایک ہی بات یہ کہہ کر کہ y کا لاگ بیس صفر x صفر کے برابر ہے جو x کے برابر ہے اب یہاں مسئلہ یہ ہے کہ صفر سے کسی بھی چیز کا صفر صحیح ہوتا ہے، لہذا اگر ہم صرف لاگ بیس صفر کے بارے میں سوچ رہے ہیں y کسی دوسرے ان پٹ کے لیے y جو آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ کچھ ان پٹ کرنا چاہتے ہیں جیسے ایک یا دو یا pi کچھ بھی جو آپ چاہیں، آپ سوال صفر سے پوچھ رہے ہیں کہ ایک یا دو یا pi یا جو بھی نمبر آپ کے پاس ہو سکتا ہے اور اس کا کوئی جواب نہیں ہوگا لہذا آپ بہترین طور پر یہ کہنے کی کوشش کر سکتے ہیں اوہ ہاں، صفر کا لاگ، یہ ایک بالکل درست فنکشن ہے اس کی وضاحت صرف ان پٹ صفر پر کی گئی ہے لیکن اس کے باوجود آپ کو اپنی خواہش کو ختم کرنے کی کوشش میں دشواری ہوگی۔ وہاں کیونکہ صفر کو صفر کہتے ہیں جو صفر کے برابر ہوتا ہے اس پر کچھ بھی لاگو ہوتا ہے لہذا آپ کا بازو آپ کی پیٹھ کے پیچھے مڑا جائے گا تاہم آپ یہ کام کرنا چاہتے ہیں اور یہ اس حقیقت سے مطابقت رکھتا ہے کہ بیس صفر کے ساتھ ایکسپونشنل فنکشن مکمل طور پر صفر ہے۔ نمبروں کو ایک دوسرے پر اچھے انداز میں نقشہ نہیں بناتا ہے لہذا یہ ایک بہت اچھا سوال ہے، کیا آپ کے پاس لاگ بیس صفر ہے اب اس خیال پر واپس آ سکتے ہیں کہ یہ چیزیں حقیقی دنیا میں کہاں آتی ہیں ایک مثال جو مجھے پسند ہے زلزلوں کے لیے ریکٹر اسکیل اس لیے ریکٹر اسکیل سے ہمیں اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ زلزلہ کتنا طاقتور ہے اور یہ بہت چھوٹی تعداد سے لے کر بہت بڑی تعداد تک کچھ بھی ہوسکتا ہے جیسا کہ میرے خیال میں اب تک کا سب سے بڑا زلزلہ ماپا گیا ہے اور یہ صرف ایک چارٹ ہے جس سے آیا ہے۔ ویکیپیڈیا ایک 9 تھا۔ 5 اور اس بات کی تعریف کرنے کے لئے کہ یہ کتنا پاگل پن ہے کہ ان نمبروں کے معنی اور پھر TNT کی مساوی مقدار کے درمیان تعلق کو دیکھنے کے قابل ہے جیسے کہ اس میں کتنی توانائی ہے اور پھر ہم یہاں کیا کرنے کی کوشش کر سکتے ہیں۔ یہ دیکھنا ہے کہ کیا ہم توانائی کی مقدار کے لحاظ سے ریکٹر سکیل نمبر کے لیے کوئی اظہار حاصل کر سکتے ہیں اور لوگارتھمز اس کو بیان کرنے کا ایک فطری طریقہ کیوں ہو گا، اس لیے توجہ مرکوز کرنے کی کلید یہ ہے کہ ہم آگے بڑھنے کے لیے اقدامات کر رہے ہیں کہ چیزیں کتنی بڑھتی ہیں لہذا مثال کے طور پر اگر ہم اس معاملے میں دو کنویں سے جاتے ہیں تو یہ ہمیں نہیں دکھاتا ہے کہ تین کہاں ہے تو شاید ہم دو سے چار تک ایک قدم اٹھانے کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں جو اس طرح ہے جیسے دو قدم اٹھانا اس کے معاملے میں کیا کرتا ہے توانائی کی مقدار اچھی طرح سے ایسا لگتا ہے کہ یہ ہمیں ایک میٹرک ٹن TNT سے لیتا ہے جو کہ میرا اندازہ ہے کہ دوسری جنگ عظیم کا ایک بڑا بم ہے اور یہ ہمیں ایک کلوٹن تک ایک ہزار گنا زیادہ لے جاتا ہے جو ایک چھوٹا ایٹم بم ہے تو صرف دو قدم ریکٹر اسکیل پر 2 کی شدت کے زلزلے سے 4 شدت کے زلزلے کی طرف جانا ہمیں دوسری جنگ عظیم سے لے کر ایٹمی دور تک بڑے بم سے لے جاتا ہے تاکہ یہ قابل ذکر ہے اور پہلا صاف قدم جو ہمیں ملتا ہے وہ 4 سے 5 بجے تک جا رہا ہے۔ کم از کم اس لحاظ سے کہ یہ چارٹ ہمیں اچھی طرح سے دکھا رہا ہے اور ظاہر ہے کہ 4 سے 5 تک ایک قدم بڑھنا 1 کلوٹن سے 32 کلوٹن تک جانے کے مساوی ہے اور یہ ظاہر ہے کہ شہر کو تباہ کرنے والے بم کا سائز تھا جو ناگاساکی پر گرا تھا لہذا یہ شاید ایک ہے۔ ایسی چیز جو لوگارتھمک پیمانوں کے بارے میں متضاد ہوسکتی ہے اگر آپ صرف خبروں میں سن رہے ہیں کہ اوہ کے درمیان ایک زلزلہ آیا تھا جو 4 تھا۔ 0 بمقابلہ ایک زلزلہ جو 5 تھا۔ 0 یہ سوچنا آسان ہے کہ ہاں 4 اور 5 یہ کافی ملتے جلتے نمبر ہیں لیکن واضح طور پر TNT کی مقدار کے لحاظ سے جو کہ 1 سے دوسرے تک پہنچنے کے لیے 32 سے ضرب کرنے کے مساوی ہے اور 2 سے 4 تک جانا ظاہر ہے کہ تقریباً ایک ہزار سے ضرب ہو رہی تھی اور صرف اس کی بڑی وجہ یہ ہے کہ یہاں ہمارا چارٹ یہ نہیں دکھا رہا تھا کہ 3 کیا ہے لہذا ہم دو قدم اٹھا رہے ہیں اور آپ خود تصدیق کر سکتے ہیں کہ اگر آپ 32 کا ایک قدم اٹھاتے ہیں اور پھر آپ کو دوسرے 32 سے ضرب دیتے ہیں جو کہ حقیقت میں ایک ہزار کے قریب ہے۔ یہ خیال کہ ریکٹر نمبر پر اضافی اقدامات TNT میں ضرب کے مراحل سے مطابقت رکھتے ہیں ایسا لگتا ہے کہ یہاں کچھ لوگارتھمک کام کر رہا ہے اور یہ تھوڑا سا دلچسپ ہے کہ یہاں جاری رکھیں اور یہ بتائیں کہ یہ جزوی طور پر عالمی مظاہر کی وجہ سے کتنا بڑھتا ہے۔ ہاں بیان کرنا کوئی بڑی حیرت کی بات نہیں کہ جب ہم ایک اور قدم اٹھاتے ہیں تو یہ ایک بار پھر تقریباً 32 سے بڑھتا جا رہا ہے لیکن ہمارے وجدان کے مطابق یہ 32 کلوٹن چھوٹے ایٹم بم اور پھر ایک میگاٹن کے درمیان فرق ہے جسے ہم چھوٹا ایٹم بم نہیں سمجھ سکتے، ناگاساکی ایٹم بم جس کے بارے میں میرا اندازہ ہے کہ ایک میگاٹن کے ناگاساکی ایٹم بموں میں سے 32 ہیں جو ظاہر ہے کہ نیواڈا یو ایس اے 1994 میں آنے والے ڈبل سٹرنگ فلیٹ زلزلے کی شدت ہے مجھے نہیں معلوم تھا کہ وہ کیا تھا، شکریہ ویکیپیڈیا تعدد کے لحاظ سے۔ واضح طور پر ان کو بھی دیکھا جو دو سے کم ہیں، یہ ہر وقت ہوتے ہیں ان میں سے روزانہ 8000 کی طرح ہوتے ہیں لیکن جیسے ہی ہم ایٹم بم کے دائرے میں آتے ہیں جیسے 3۔ 5 اور 4 یہ بھی ظاہر ہے کہ زمین پر کہیں نہ کہیں اکثر ہوتے ہیں ان میں سے تقریباً 134 ایسے ہیں جو روزانہ کہیں نہ کہیں ہو رہے ہیں کون جانتا ہے؟ لیکن جیسا کہ ہم اس 5 اور 6 رینج میں اور بھی زیادہ شدت اختیار کر گئے ہیں جو ایٹم بم کے پیمانے سے کافی اوپر تھے اب ہم صرف 2 فی دن کے قریب ہیں اور مجھے یقین ہے کہ ایک ماہر ارضیات آکر وضاحت کر سکتا ہے کہ ہم سب کو کیوں اس حقیقت کے بارے میں زیادہ پریشان نہ ہوں کہ زمین کی پرت میں دو ایٹم بم کے مساوی رکاوٹیں ہر روز ہو رہی ہیں لیکن شاید یہ خاص طور پر ان لوگوں کے لئے نایاب ہے جو کسی ایسے شہر جیسے کسی جگہ پر مرکوز ہوں جہاں اب بہت سارے لوگ رہتے ہیں صرف ہمارے خیال کی تصدیق کرتے ہیں کہ ہر قدم 32 کی ترقی شامل ہے آئیے دیکھتے ہیں کہ 6 سے 7 تک کا مرحلہ کیسا لگتا ہے اور یہاں یہ ہمیں بہت ساری مثالیں دے رہا ہے اس کے درمیان شاید یہ وہم پیدا ہو کہ یہ حقیقت سے بڑا قدم ہے اور حقیقت میں یہ 1 میگاٹن اور کے درمیان فرق ہے۔ 32 میگاٹن اس طرح 32 سے ضرب کر رہا ہے اس چارٹ میں مجھے سب سے زیادہ دلچسپ چیز میں سے ایک یہ دیکھنا تھا کہ ہمیں سب سے بڑے ایٹمی ہتھیار تک پہنچنے سے پہلے کتنی دور جانا ہے جس کا حقیقت میں تجربہ کیا گیا ہے یہ سرد جنگ کا عروج تھا۔ زار بم جو 50 میگاٹن کا تھا اور مجھے یقین ہے کہ ان کا اصل میں 100 میگا ٹن بم رکھنے کا منصوبہ تھا لیکن وہ خود اس 50 میگاٹن سے نیچے بات کر رہے ہیں، ہم بات شروع کر رہے ہیں کہ ناگاساکی بم کے 32 کلوٹن کو 32 سے ضرب دے کر 100 میگا ٹن کا بم بنایا جائے۔ میگاٹن کو مزید 32 سے ضرب دیں تو ہم دوسری جنگ عظیم کے خاتمے کے دھماکے سے ہزار گنا زیادہ طاقت کے بارے میں بات کر رہے ہیں اور آپ اب بھی 50 میگاٹن پر نہیں ہیں جس کی انسانیت قابل ہے اور یہ ظاہر ہے کہ انڈونیشیا کا جاوا کا زلزلہ ہے تاکہ 7۔.",

  "input": "0 range that we're talking about the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out and this is indicative of one area where logarithms tend to come about it's when humans want to create a scale for something that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be so in the case of size of earthquakes you can have things from what happens just all the time around the Earth, the size of a large hand grenade and you want that to be on your scale and something to think about ranging all the way up to the largest disruption that we've seen in human history and in order to have that in a way that you're not just writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case and a whole bunch of different, a smaller number of digits for your number in another case it's nice to take logarithms and then just put that on a single scale that basically squishes those numbers between 0 and 10 you see something very similar going on with the decibel scale for music that one actually works a little bit differently where every time you take a step up of 10 decibels that corresponds to multiplying by 10 so rather than a step of 1 multiplying by 10, it's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10 so that kind of makes the math of it a little bit screwy but the idea is the same, that if you're listening to a sound that's 50 decibels versus 60 decibels it's a lot quieter in terms of the energy being transmitted and going from, what would it be, 60 to 70 or 70 to 80 those steps, from 60 up to 80, that involves multiplying the amount of energy per square area by a factor of 100 so every time you see a logarithmic scale, know in your mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount this is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus outbreak so how might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the Richter scale number by 1, you're multiplying by 32 well, we could think in terms of a log with base 32 I could say if I take the log of, I'm just going to call r, the number for the Richter scale I might think of this as log base 32 and that's going to correspond to, no no no, I'm doing this wrong that's not the thing that's logged we take the log base 32 of the big number, of the TMT number, something that was like 1 megaton it's 1 million tons the log base 32, that should correspond to the Richter scale number but there might be some kind of offset, so we might say that there's some kind of constant s that we're adding to this Richter scale number and this expression is exactly the same, excuse me for going off the bottom there this expression is exactly the same as saying 32 to the power of some offset times our Richter scale number which is the same as taking 32 to that offset, which itself is just some big constant, times 32 to the Richter scale number so you might think of this as just being some constant times 32 to the power of the number you see so this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it that if this is what corresponds to the TMT amount that you see, as you increase that r step by step you're multiplying by 32 but another way of communicating the exact same fact is to take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is alright now the next thing I want to talk about is how we don't always have to worry about how to compute logs of different bases it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32, I referenced earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e computer scientists really like to have a log with base 2 and it turns out for computational purposes or for also thinking about how these things grow if you have one log, if you're able to compute one type of log, whether that's base 10, base 2, base e you can compute pretty much anything else that you want now to get our intuitions in that direction, let's turn back to our quiz and go to the next question and I believe that this question is the most, I don't know, this is a halfway reasonable question, this should be nice this is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2 context to base 10 context and it's also a good intuition for understanding powers of 2 to have in general the relationship that it has with powers of 10 because it's this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that these two sort of well you'll see what I mean, they play nicely with each other so our question asks, given the fact that 2 to the 10th is 1024, 1024, which is approximately 1000 so if you're being a little bit loose with your numbers and you're just making approximations 2 to the 10th, basically 1000, which of the following is closest to being true?",

ہے۔ تھوڑا سا مختلف ہے جہاں ہر بار جب آپ 10 ڈیسیبل کا ایک قدم اٹھاتے ہیں جو 10 سے ضرب کرنے کے مساوی ہوتا ہے تو 1 کے ایک قدم کو 10 سے ضرب کرنے کے بجائے، یہ 10 کا ایک قدم ہے جو 10 سے ضرب کرتا ہے اس طرح اس کی ریاضی کو تھوڑا سا بناتا ہے تھوڑا سا عجیب لیکن خیال ایک ہی ہے، کہ اگر آپ کوئی ایسی آواز سن رہے ہیں جو 50 ڈیسیبل بمقابلہ 60 ڈیسیبل ہے تو یہ توانائی کے منتقل ہونے اور جانے کے لحاظ سے بہت زیادہ پرسکون ہے، یہ کیا ہوگا، 60 سے 70 یا 70 سے؟ 80 وہ مراحل، 60 سے 80 تک، جس میں توانائی کی مقدار کو فی مربع رقبہ کو 100 کے فیکٹر سے ضرب دینا شامل ہے، لہذا جب بھی آپ لوگاریتھمک پیمانہ دیکھیں، اپنے ذہن میں جان لیں کہ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ جس کا بھی حوالہ دیا جا رہا ہے اس کے نیچے بڑھتا ہے۔ ایک بہت بڑی رقم یہی وجہ ہے کہ ہم نے کورونا وائرس کے پھیلاؤ کو بیان کرنے کے لیے استعمال ہونے والے بہت سے لوگاریتھمک پیمانے دیکھے ہیں تو آپ اس طرح کے رشتے کو کیسے بیان کرسکتے ہیں جہاں ہر بار جب آپ ریکٹر اسکیل نمبر کو 1 سے بڑھاتے ہیں تو آپ کو 32 سے ضرب لگاتے ہیں، ہم بیس 32 کے ساتھ لاگ کے لحاظ سے سوچ سکتا ہوں، میں کہہ سکتا ہوں کہ اگر میں لاگ کو لیتا ہوں، تو میں صرف r کو کال کرنے جا رہا ہوں، ریکٹر اسکیل کے لیے وہ نمبر جسے میں لاگ بیس 32 سمجھ سکتا ہوں اور یہ اس کے مطابق ہوگا۔ ، نہیں نہیں نہیں، میں یہ غلط کر رہا ہوں کہ لاگ ان ہونے والی چیز نہیں ہے، ہم بڑے نمبر کا لاگ بیس 32 لیتے ہیں، TMT نمبر کا، کچھ جو کہ 1 میگاٹن جیسا تھا، یہ لاگ بیس 32 کے مقابلے میں 1 ملین ٹن ہے، اسے ہونا چاہیے۔ ریکٹر اسکیل نمبر سے مطابقت رکھتا ہے لیکن اس میں کچھ قسم کا آفسیٹ ہوسکتا ہے، اس لیے ہم کہہ سکتے ہیں کہ کچھ مستقل s ہے جسے ہم اس ریکٹر اسکیل نمبر میں جوڑ رہے ہیں اور یہ اظہار بالکل وہی ہے، معاف کیجئے گا نیچے یہ اظہار بالکل ویسا ہی ہے جیسے کچھ آف سیٹ اوقات کی طاقت کو 32 کہتے ہیں ہمارے ریکٹر اسکیل نمبر جو کہ 32 کو اس آفسیٹ میں لینے کے مترادف ہے، جو بذات خود کچھ بڑا مستقل ہے، ریکٹر اسکیل نمبر پر 32 گنا ہے لہذا آپ اس کے بارے میں یہ سوچ سکتا ہے کہ آپ جو نمبر دیکھتے ہیں اس کی طاقت سے صرف 32 کا کچھ مستقل ہونا ہے لہذا اسے لکھنے کا یہ طریقہ واقعی اس کی تیز رفتار نمو پر زور دیتا ہے کہ اگر یہ وہی ہے جو آپ کو نظر آنے والی TMT رقم کے مساوی ہے، جیسا کہ آپ اس میں اضافہ کرتے ہیں۔ r قدم بہ قدم آپ 32 سے ضرب کر رہے ہیں لیکن بالکل اسی حقیقت کو بتانے کا ایک اور طریقہ یہ ہے کہ جو بھی رقم ٹھیک ہے اس کا لاگ بیس 32 لینا ہے اب اگلی چیز جس کے بارے میں میں بات کرنا چاہتا ہوں وہ یہ ہے کہ ہمیں ہمیشہ اس کی ضرورت نہیں ہے۔ مختلف اڈوں کے لاگس کی گنتی کرنے کے بارے میں فکر کریں یہاں یہ قدرے عجیب ہے کہ ہم لاگ بیس 32 کے بارے میں بات کر رہے تھے، میں نے پہلے حوالہ دیا تھا کہ ریاضی دان کس طرح واقعی بیس کے ساتھ لاگ رکھنا پسند کرتے ہیں اور کمپیوٹر سائنس دان واقعی بیس 2 کے ساتھ لاگ رکھنا پسند کرتے ہیں۔ کمپیوٹیشنل مقاصد کے لیے یا اس بارے میں سوچنے کے لیے کہ اگر آپ کے پاس ایک لاگ ہے تو یہ چیزیں کیسے بڑھتی ہیں، اگر آپ ایک قسم کے لاگ کی گنتی کرنے کے قابل ہیں، چاہے وہ بیس 10 ہو، بیس 2، بیس اور آپ کسی اور چیز کا حساب لگا سکتے ہیں۔ اب آپ چاہتے ہیں کہ ہمارے وجدان اس سمت میں جائیں، آئیے اپنے کوئز کی طرف واپس جائیں اور اگلے سوال پر جائیں اور مجھے یقین ہے کہ یہ سوال سب سے زیادہ ہے، مجھے نہیں معلوم، یہ ایک آدھا معقول سوال ہے، یہ اچھا ہونا چاہیے۔ یہ صرف ہمیں بیس 2 سیاق و سباق سے بیس 10 کے سیاق و سباق میں ترجمہ کرنے کے لیے تیار کرنے والا ہے اور یہ 2 کی طاقتوں کو سمجھنے کے لیے بھی ایک اچھا ادراک ہے کہ عام طور پر اس کا تعلق 10 کی طاقتوں کے ساتھ ہے کیونکہ یہ اس خوبصورت قسم کا اتفاق ہے۔ فطرت کہ یہ دونوں طرح کی اچھی طرح سے آپ دیکھیں گے کہ میرا کیا مطلب ہے، وہ ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ اچھی طرح کھیلتے ہیں لہذا ہمارا سوال پوچھتا ہے، اس حقیقت کو دیکھتے ہوئے کہ 2 سے 10 ویں 1024، 1024 ہے، جو تقریباً 1000 ہے، لہذا اگر آپ ایک ہو رہے ہیں اپنے نمبروں کے ساتھ تھوڑا سا ڈھیلا ہے اور آپ صرف 2 سے 10 ویں، بنیادی طور پر 1000 کا تخمینہ لگا رہے ہیں، مندرجہ ذیل میں سے کون سا سچ ہونے کے قریب ہے؟ لاگ بیس 2 از 10 تقریباً 0 ہے۔ 10 میں سے 3 لاگ بیس 2 تقریباً ہے، معذرت، 2 میں سے لاگ بیس 10 تقریباً 0 ہے۔ 10 میں سے 3 لاگ بیس 2 تقریباً 1 تہائی ہے یا لاگ بیس 2 کا 10 تقریباً 1 تہائی ہے ان میں سے کون سا سچ ہونے کے قریب ہے اس حقیقت کی بنیاد پر کہ 2 سے 10 ویں بنیادی طور پر 1000 ہے؟ میں آپ کو اس دلچسپ بات کے لیے تھوڑا سا لمحہ دوں گا کہ ہمیں اس پر ایک قسم کی تقسیم مل گئی ہے لہذا میں سوچ رہا ہوں کہ آیا وہ عددی طور پر کافی مماثل ہوں گے یا اگر وہ تصوراتی طور پر ایک جیسے ہوں گے یا اگر ان دونوں میں ایک فرق بھی ہے لہذا چونکہ جوابات آتے رہتے ہیں، میں اسے تھوڑا سا اور وقت دینے جا رہا ہوں تاکہ گھر میں موجود کوئی بھی دیکھ رہا ہو، امید ہے کہ آپ کے پاس پہلے سے ہی ایک پنسل اور کاغذ موجود ہے جو آپ خود ان کے ذریعے نوڈلنگ کر سکتے ہیں، یعنی لیکچرز کی روح جو ہم کر رہے ہیں اگر آپ ایسا نہیں کرتے ہیں، اب وقت ہے کہ ایک پنسل اور کاغذ نکالیں اور دیکھیں کہ کیا آپ اس پر غور کر سکتے ہیں اور اس میں سے کچھ مسائل لکھ سکتے ہیں جن پر ہم جا رہے ہیں۔ یہاں تک تعمیر کرنے کے لیے یقینی طور پر پنسل اور کاغذ کی ضرورت ہوگی لہذا اب اتنا ہی اچھا وقت ہے جتنا کہ کسی بھی وقت اور اگر آپ اسے مستقبل میں دیکھ رہے ہیں، یہاں تک کہ اگر آپ لائیو پول میں حصہ نہیں لے سکتے ہیں تو میں واقعی میں سوچتا ہوں کہ یہ بہت مزے کی بات ہے۔ اپنی ہی ٹوپی کو مکس میں ڈالیں چاہے وہ ان نمبروں میں سے کسی ایک میں حصہ نہ ڈالے جو آپ اسکرین پر بڑھتے ہوئے دیکھ رہے ہیں میں آپ کو یہاں تھوڑا سا اور وقت دوں گا کیونکہ جوابات آتے رہتے ہیں اب ایسا ہی ہے۔ اپنی پنسل اور کاغذ نکال کر دیکھیں کہ کیا آپ اس کے بارے میں سوچ سکتے ہیں اور اسے لکھ سکتے ہیں تو اب اتنا ہی اچھا وقت ہے جتنا کسی بھی وقت اور اگر آپ اس کے ذریعے سوچ سکتے ہیں تو آپ اس کے ذریعے سوچ سکتے ہیں اور اسے لکھ سکتے ہیں۔ لہذا اب اتنا ہی اچھا وقت ہے جتنا کہ کسی بھی وقت اور اگر آپ اس کے بارے میں سوچ سکتے ہیں اور پھر اپنا موو اوکے کر سکتے ہیں، تو میں آگے جا کر اسے ابھی درجہ دوں گا اور دیکھتے ہیں کہ لوگوں نے اس پر کیسے کیا تو صحیح جواب ہے B جو کیا یہ لاگ بیس 10 از 2 خوش آمدید!",

  "input": "you you you okay so even if you are still thinking about it I'm gonna go ahead and grade it here and then start talking about why it's true and then also why we should care why this is an operation that actually tells us something so the correct answer which it looks like around 1700 of you got congratulations is log base C of B times log base B of A is equal to log base C of A great now that's just a big ol pile of things why would that be true how do we think about it now phase one like I said we might plug in an example but let's try to actually think about why the example holds so let me pull out we've got this as one more of the log rules this is just repeating the end what the correct answer turned out to be where we've got an expression for log base C of B log base B of A and this ends up being log base C of A it's gotten rid of the B's which is kind of interesting so some examples you might plug in here would be things like let's use a different color let's use green instead of C I'm gonna go ahead and plug in 10 log base 10 of 100 which is kind of asking how many times does 10 go into an 100 in a multiplicative sense how many times do I multiply 10 by itself to get to 100 where the answer is 2 and then log of 100 of let's plug in another power of 10 it'll be nice if it's also a power of 100 so I'll do a million so this one is asking 10 100 to the what equals a million how many times do I multiply a hundred by itself to get to a million how many times does a hundred go into a million phrasing the same thing ten different ways now the claim is that this is the same thing as taking log base 10 of a million that if I ask how many times does 10 go into 100 and how many times does 100 go into a million multiplying those should give me the answer to how many times 10 goes into a million now just checking the numbers this certainly works 10 goes into a hundred two times 100 goes into a million three times in a multiplicative sense in that a hundred cubed is equal to a million and indeed how many times does 10 go into a million well six now we could think of this property in terms of the corresponding exponent rule which is going to look a little bit stranger but it's actually just saying the entirely the same thing so here we're if we have a base of C and a base of B and we're trying to relate those to each other the whole statement is equal to saying that um suppose that B to the X is equal to a got some number B you raise it to some number X and equals a suppose it's also the case that C to the Y equals B those two together are the same as saying C to the XY equals a now that's kind of a mouthful to say out loud but if you plug in some numbers to translate what all of that is really saying in the context of the example we just did saying if you can write a hundred is ten squared and if you can write a million as a hundred cubed well that lets you write a million in terms of a power of ten okay so sort of asking this question how many times does one number go into another but letting you layer it on top of each other now if we rearrange that expression we get what is probably the second most important of all of our log rules the most important is this top one that when you multiply the inputs you add the outputs but the second most important which is known as the change of base formula lets us rate that if you want the log base B of some value a then for whatever C you want it doesn't actually matter what log you have in your pocket if you use that other log and you take the log C of a divided by the log C of B that gives you log base B of a okay so just as an example here what this would look like is let's say I wanted to be able to compute log base 100 of things I just really want to it's not a button on my calculator but I would love to be able to do it and I want to do it in with an input like a million well even if I don't have the log base 100 button on my calculator what I can do is say I'll use the log base 10 button and evaluate what's on the inside here which at least positionally it's kind of above the 100 it has a higher altitude as we write it so this can line up with the notation a little bit that it sits on the numerator and on the bottom I use the log base 10 button that's in my calculator on the base on the 100 and then I can evaluate both of those and it'll give me the answer in this case it gets you 6 divided by 2 which will be 3 and if we really just think through what this is saying I know I've said it many different times but it's a it's a convoluted enough way to write things but an intuitive enough fact that I think just coming at it from a bunch of different angles can be important because like I said this is probably the second most important log rule we're asking how many times does 100 go into a million in a multiplicative sense how many times they multiply by itself but division is asking that same question in an additive sense if I say how many times does the log of 100 go into the log of a million that's what division means it's saying how many times do I add this bottom number to itself to get to the top but anything additive in the logarithm realm is the same as anything multiplicative in terms of what's inside the parentheses so both of the left-hand side and the right-hand side are just saying how many times does 100 go into a million but going about that in different ways so this is extremely nice because it actually lets us compute things next time we're going to talk all about the natural logarithm which is log base e often written ln and turns out this is much easier to compute there's nice math behind it such that if you want to come up with an algorithm that your calculator can use it's actually a lot easier to think of log base e of numbers so anytime that you need to go to some kind of calculator I don't know let's say we popped over to something like Desmos always happy to have as a friend and you wanted to compute log base 10 of some number you know let's say we're doing log base 10 of 57 and it looks like that's you know it should make sense it's between 1 and 2 because 57 was between 10 and 100 what's going on under the hood how is it actually figuring this out it's going to use somewhere in there a change of base formula which is going to be that the natural log of 57 divided by the natural log of 10 is the same thing these are two different ways of writing it so if you know one logarithm you know all of the logarithms okay and well let's just use that fact to answer one more of our quiz questions and this will be the second to last quiz question so thank you all for sticking it through I think we will be I think you'll be pleased by the last question because the last question will actually be like a fun problem-solving puzzle II thing and it will involve a lot of what we've used up to this point kind of a culminating thing so before that though just to make sure that we've got the instincts of change of base down what do we have use the approximation that log base 2 of 10 is around 10 thirds so using that approximation which of the following is approximately true log base 2 of X is about 10 thirds of log base 10 of X log base 2 of X is log base 10 of 10 thirds of X log base 2 of X is log base 10 of X to the power 10 thirds or log base 2 of X is 10 thirds times the log base 10 of X and finally none of the above so I'll give you a moment to think about that you might want to think to the chart that we were drawing earlier and thinking about log base 2 and log base 10 as we're looking at powers of 1000 and how each of those grows that can leverage some of the intuition but I'll let you think about it stop talking you while answers are rolling in it looks like a number of people have been asking on Twitter about basically how complex numbers play into this so you know we've got Jamil asking what if the base is imaginary we've got Kalkan asking what about complex bases since e to the X is walking around the spiral wouldn't it hit every complex number we won't hit every complex number but your instinct that it's hitting multiple things is pretty spot-on doesn't make sense to talk about logs with imaginary numbers by Nitya so to all of these questions it's actually a very nuanced question the short answer is yes complex log rhythms absolutely exist but each one of them has multiple different outputs so a good a good analogy here is how if we have the square root function if I ask something like the square root of 5 you know we have the convention that you always do the positive amount but that doesn't quite feel honest it feels like the right answer is to specify that there's two different outputs for the square root function two solutions to x squared equals 25 and this is actually true in complex numbers as well one of the things we talked about in a complex number lecture was that you can take the square root of I and you actually get root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I but that there's two solutions you can do plus or minus this value and so you could say that the square root function isn't a function but it's a multi-valued function it always has two different outputs now something funky happens when we have exponents at play so if you're just like someone who hasn't seen this stuff don't worry we talked about it in previous lectures I'm obviously jumping around on the complexity level a lot here where if in lecture five I'm talking about like Euler's formula with complex numbers and compound interest and like how that plays into physics and then lecture six we're back to the basics of logarithms I acknowledge that might be a little bit jarring to potential audience members but just continuing on with the answer if you note that e to the 2 pi times you know some number times I this basically walks you around a circle so that the output will walk around a circle and just keep repeating as n goes from 0 up to 1 it'll walk around one cycle and end up back where you started as n goes from 1 to 2 you'll end up back where you started so for example e to the 0 sits here e to the I pi is at negative 1 but e to the 2 pi I is also at 1 same with e excuse me same with e to the 4 pi I that also equals 1 so in general if you wanted to ask something like what is the log base e of 1 you know the one hand we want to say the log of log base anything of 1 should be 0 because anything to the power 0 equals that 1 but if we're letting complex numbers into the mix you would have to honestly say well 2 pi I is another pretty good answer to this question because e to the 2 pi I also equals 1 and same with 4 pi I and you could even go in the negative direction and in general n times pi times 2 times I kind of wrote that in a weird order for any integer in feels like a valid answer to this question so there's a couple ways that you can deal with that in math and before we get back to our usual lesson just on logarithm rules this is interesting enough I kind of want to pull it up let's see what if we have complex logarithm great Wikipedia always to our aid probably it'll have a nice like visual of some kind for us look such fancy color diagrams what I want okay this is what I want wonderful let's zoom out a little bit great so there's this notion of what's called a Riemann surface that's basically trying to capture the idea that you have a function with multiple outputs and intuitively maybe you can understand what it's getting at where the input would be something on the XY plane and the output there's just many different outputs sitting there so when you have a complex logarithm you have to account for that but it's used it's actually a very useful idea to do but it takes a lot more nuance than than you might expect so with all of that hopefully that helped at least partially answer some of people's questions same same by the way with logarithms with based negative numbers because if you're asking like negative 1 to the X and really noodling on what that means it's it gets you into the realm of complex numbers so you have to deal with the same multiple output idea now answers are rolling in more slowly so this seems like a fine time to grade things and the answer turns out to be you rescale it if you want to go from log base 2 of something to log base 10 of something it involves rescaling and one way you could think about this is with the change of base formula so let's say we have now let's get rid of our E stuff let's say you have log base 2 of X but we want to write it in terms of log base 10 we can write that as log base 10 of X divided by log base 10 of 2 saying how many times does 2 go into X in a multiplicative sense is the same as saying how many times does the log of 2 go into the log of X in an additive sense okay and well what is 1 divided by the log base 10 of 2 so we're going to keep our log base 10 of X out here and from what we found earlier we found that log base 10 of 2 was approximately 3 tenths was approximately 0.",

  "input": "3 so when we divide by it that should get us 10 thirds okay and this lines up with what we were looking at a little bit earlier with powers of 1000 let's see where was it where was it great so when we're converting from log base 10 of something up to log base 2 you know here we were thinking of multiplying the top by 0.",
