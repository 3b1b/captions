2
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,780
Welcome back to Lockdown Math. Today we are going to be talking about logarithms and kind of a back to the basics sort of lesson.

3
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,780
The intent is for someone who maybe is not familiar with logarithms yet or who has seen some of the rules but has been confused by them.

4
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,780
And as always, to kick things off, I just want to get a sense of where the audience is at right now.

5
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Because I have a couple suspicions, but I think doing a live poll to see where everyone is might be helpful.

6
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:10,780
So, if you can go to 3b1b.co. Live, which you can find the link in the description, and you can also just follow the link that's up on screen here,

7
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:18,780
you'll find a poll. And at the moment it asks what best describes your relationship with logarithms?

8
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,780
a. I've never heard about them before or never learned about them before

9
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,780
b. I've learned about them but sometimes get confused by all of the properties

10
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,780
c. I understand them but wouldn't know how to teach them

11
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,780
and d. I understand them well and could comfortably teach them to someone else to make them understand well too.

12
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,780
So, we've got a good split. This is good and interesting.

13
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Like I said, the intent for this is to create a lesson that I can point people to in the future if they're just not comfortable with logarithms

14
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,780
and I want to be able to say, oh, here's a place that you can go for how I think, you know, how I think you could approach it intuitively.

15
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,780
And for those who are in the camps of, let's say, understanding it but not knowing how to teach it,

16
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I think there's an interesting meta question around logarithms.

17
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Because I was scrolling around a couple of teacher forums before doing this particular lecture

18
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,780
and when people ask what is the hardest topic to teach in high school math

19
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,780
in the sense that students seem to have trouble with it the most, logarithms is one of the most commonly indicated answers

20
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,780
which is interesting and I can guess maybe it's because there's a ton of these properties that you end up having to learn

21
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,780
you know, so if we skip ahead of where we're going to go

22
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,780
you've got all these piles of rules that just look like a bunch of algebra that can be hard to remember

23
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,780
and easy to kind of mix things up in your head

24
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,780
and I think when people have, you know, these sort of nightmarish recollections of what high school math was like

25
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,780
and what logarithms did for them, it's often those particular formulas coming to mind

26
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,780
and what I want to do today is try to talk through one, how to think about them

27
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,780
but also just on the meta level of if you're teaching somebody algebra, what are the points worth emphasizing?

28
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,780
What's the way to get it built in their intuitions?

29
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,780
So let's go ahead and see how people are answering on this one

30
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,780
we've got a pretty even split between three possible categories

31
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,780
alright, so the most common viewer right now answered C, that they understand them but they wouldn't know how to teach them

32
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,780
the second most common are those who said they understand them well and they could comfortably teach them

33
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,780
so this is sort of revealing that, okay, the existing audience on the channel at the moment

34
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,780
people who are into math and they're going to be pretty comfortable with logarithms

35
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,780
and then after that, B, people who are confused by some of the properties

36
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,780
and then at the bottom, people who have never learned about them

37
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,780
now, if you watching are one of the people who answered A, that you've never learned about them

38
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,780
or that you're not comfortable, keep in mind this lecture is actually meant for you

39
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,780
so when we're doing some live quizzing and we're going to have an answer on here

40
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,780
and we're going to have people, you know, answering probably pretty quickly, probably correctly

41
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,780
given that as you can see, most of them are coming in comfortable with logarithms

42
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,780
don't let that be intimidating, don't let that be something that indicates you should be answering quickly

43
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,780
or you should necessarily be getting the right answer

44
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,780
alright, so I think the most intuitive way to think about logs

45
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,780
if you're just going to start off, is to say at a very high level

46
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,780
logarithms are something that can take in a power of 10

47
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,780
and it just spits out the number of zeros at the end of the number

48
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,780
it does more than that, as we'll talk about

49
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,780
but just at the very high level, this is getting a sense for what they do

50
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
and I think it's pretty important

51
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,780
because what you're saying here is, hey look, as we walk from 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10,000

52
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,780
each step we're multiplying by 10

53
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,780
the output of the log, the log of that value, just steps up in these increments of 1

54
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,780
so you could think about this as saying, hmm, when I plug in a number to the log

55
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,780
if that number happens to be a power of 10, I'm just counting the number of zeros

56
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,780
what's log of 1000? oh, it has 3 zeros on it

57
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,780
what's log of a million? oh, it has 6 zeros on it

58
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,780
it's the zero counting function

59
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,780
and I think you can get yourself very far in terms of understanding various properties of logarithms

60
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,780
just by thinking in the back of your mind, ok, when I plug in a power of 10

61
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,780
it's a zero counting function, I plug in a billion, how many zeros are at the end of a billion?

62
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,780
and these numbers are all very intuitive to us, we see them in the news

63
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,780
we anchor our intuitions in terms of how many digits does a number have

64
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,780
and logarithms are just capturing that idea

65
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,780
and in fact, logarithms have been of particular interest in the last couple of months

66
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,780
what's kind of interesting is if you look at this Google Trends chart

67
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,780
that's just looking for logarithmic scale, ok?

68
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,780
people searching for the term logarithmic scale, you'll notice there's kind of an ambient interest

69
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,780
sitting around in September of 2019 up to February of 2020

70
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,780
and for some reason, suddenly there's a strong interest in understanding logarithmic scales from the general public

71
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,780
I wonder why that is?

72
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,780
and we see this sitting around early March or so

73
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,780
and of course this is because this is when the corona outbreak was really starting to kick into high gear

74
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,780
and everyone wanted to understand exponential growth

75
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,780
and a common way that exponential growth is plotted is with what's known as a logarithmic scale

76
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,780
so I actually made a video about this and in it I was creating some animations

77
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,780
and wanted to illustrate this idea of exponential growth

78
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,780
and the main idea here, I'll go ahead and skip back to a different animation

79
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:29,780
is if you're tracking the numbers, in this case this was the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 outside of mainland China

80
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
in the months leading up to March

81
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,780
you could just track what the absolute number is

82
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,780
but the pattern that you'll find is that as you go from one day to the next, you tend to be increasing multiplicatively

83
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,780
it's a little bit like earlier, we were seeing the powers of 10 one step to the next, you're multiplying by some amount

84
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,780
the way that the virus was growing was very similar

85
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,780
from one day to the next, you're multiplying not quite by a constant

86
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,780
but in this case, for this sequence of days, it was around 1.2 in that region, you're multiplying by something

87
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,780
so when you're plotting this, it ends up looking like this classic exponential curve that curves upward

88
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,780
and I can sometimes make it hard to see where it's going or what the overall pattern is

89
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:15,780
so a common trick is to say, instead of looking at this y-axis that increases linearly

90
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,780
as in here I'm going from 5k to 10k, 10k to 15k, 15k to 20k

91
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,780
each step is additive, we're adding 5,000

92
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,780
instead use a y-axis where each step is multiplicative

93
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,780
so you're going from 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10, 10,000

94
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,780
all of these are increases by multiplying by 10

95
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,780
and what you can say is the y-axis is now plotting not the total number of cases

96
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
but the logarithm of the total number of cases

97
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:50,780
and this actually makes it kind of easier to see on a plot if you wanted to project out what that trend would do

98
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,780
and it's a little bit of a naive model to say, oh it's going to grow exactly exponentially

99
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,780
but in the early phases of something like this, that is what it is

100
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
so I kind of fast-forward in the animation I made for that video

101
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,780
and what's interesting is if back then, I think I posted it on March 6th

102
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,780
if you just found a line of best fit and you stretched it out

103
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,780
and you said, when is that line going to cross a million?

104
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,780
which because the y-axis is growing with multiplicative steps

105
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,780
each time that you step up, you're multiplying by 10

106
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,780
so even if it might seem like the 20,000 cases or so that it was back then is very far from a million

107
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,780
you know, when you understand logarithmic scales, it actually didn't seem that far

108
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,780
it was only 30 days away if you naively just drew out that line

109
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,780
and in fact, fast-forward to around April 5th, which is when that would have predicted

110
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,780
we hit a million cases outside China

111
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
that's pretty much the day that it happened

112
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,780
I think plus or minus a day, I don't remember exactly

113
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,780
but it was right in that neighborhood because I remember thinking wow

114
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,780
it was kind of a naive model for the video to even use

115
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,780
and it's shocking that it matched so exactly

116
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,780
thankfully, since then, the growth has stopped being exponential

117
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,780
so if you look at it on a logarithmic plot, instead of going up in a straight line, it starts to taper off

118
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,780
but, point being, any time that you're coming across something in nature

119
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,780
or even in a man-made construct

120
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,780
where what's natural to think about are multiplicative increases

121
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
logarithms come in to help you

122
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
so let's go ahead and think about what these actually are

123
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
how are they defined, okay?

124
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,780
and actually there was a question asked on Twitter right before we started

125
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
that I think hits this very perfectly

126
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,780
so Max 182 asks us

127
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
additions inverse is subtraction

128
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,780
multiplications inverse is division

129
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:39,780
but I never truly understood if exponentiations inverse was nth-routing or logarithms

130
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,780
if either one could be, you know

131
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,780
if either one could really be called that way, can they?

132
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,780
that is such a fantastic question, Max

133
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,780
and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication

134
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
you're not, I'll just draw it out for you actually

135
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,780
this is going to be easiest

136
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
if we have some kind of exponential relationship

137
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,780
let's say 10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000

138
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
there's three different numbers at play here

139
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,780
showing a relationship between the 10, the 3, and the 1000

140
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,780
and aside from writing it with an exponent

141
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
there's two other ways we could write that same relationship

142
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:22,780
we could also say that the cube root of 1000 is equal to 10

143
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:29,780
this is asking 1000, what number raised to the third is equal to 1000

144
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
that's sort of what the cube root is asking

145
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,780
and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing

146
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:41,780
is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3

147
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,780
three different notations, the same exact relationship

148
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,780
a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation

149
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,780
that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship

150
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
between the three numbers with a triangle

151
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
where you'd have our 10 sitting down here

152
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,780
the power sitting at the top, 10 to the third

153
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,780
and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right

154
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,780
and whenever you want to talk about a function

155
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
or an operation between two of these numbers

156
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,780
you indicate which one of them you're leaving out

157
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,780
so to write 10 cubed, we would include the 10 on the lower left

158
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,780
the 3 on the upper right, and then we leave out that bottom one

159
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,780
so this is indicating that we're taking a power, 10 cubed

160
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,780
for that radical, what you would say is

161
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
we know what's on the bottom right

162
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
something to some power equals 1000

163
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
we even know what the power is

164
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
something cubed equals that 1000

165
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,780
but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left

166
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,780
that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation

167
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
where if the thing you don't know

168
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,780
instead of being on that bottom right is on the bottom left

169
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,780
but what logarithms are, it's an inverse in another sense

170
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,780
because what it's saying is, in this triangle relationship

171
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,780
we know the base, it's 10

172
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,780
we know the power that it should be, 1000

173
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,780
but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent

174
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,780
so to answer your question maybe even more briefly

175
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,780
we could say that 10 to the x, the inverse of that

176
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,780
the inverse is the log base 10

177
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,780
you know, of y, of some other variable

178
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,780
whereas if you're taking x to the 10th, some unknown raised to a power

179
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,780
the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value

180
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,780
and on the triangle it's basically asking

181
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,780
which of the things do we consider to be a variable

182
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,780
so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity

183
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,780
are you considering that top to be a variable quantity

184
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
and what is the unknown

185
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,780
but I really liked this idea of making explicit

186
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,780
how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact

187
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,780
one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers

188
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,780
one of them we introduce a new symbol, this radical

189
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,780
and one of them we introduce a new word, log

190
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,780
so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong

191
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,780
and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation

192
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,780
and while I don't necessarily think that we should teach logarithms with this triangle

193
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,780
because convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression

194
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,780
what I do like about it and starting off with it

195
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,780
is when you see and think about this triangle

196
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,780
it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that exponent

197
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,780
every time that you see log of some value

198
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,780
you should think in your mind, okay, whatever this number is

199
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,780
it really wants to be an exponent

200
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,780
it wants to be an exponent

201
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,780
and we'll see more of what that means as we go on

202
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,780
okay, so every time you see a log it wants to be an exponent

203
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,780
this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is

204
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
now in terms of convention

205
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,780
for the first part of this video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it

206
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,780
to be the shorthand for log base 10

207
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,780
because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there

208
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:11,780
you should know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e

209
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,780
there's also another notation for that ln for natural log

210
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
we're going to talk all about the natural log next time

211
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
so don't worry too much about that right now

212
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,780
and there's also yet another convention

213
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
often if you're in a computer science setting

214
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,780
log without any added sugar to indicate what it is

215
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
defaults to meaning log base 2

216
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
so this can sometimes be a source of confusion

217
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,780
but it basically depends on what discipline you're in

218
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,780
in math, not moth, math

219
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,780
people really like a base of e, we'll see why next lecture

220
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
in, I don't know, I'll say engineering

221
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:48,780
but really it's anything where you want good intuition with our normal base 10 number system

222
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,780
log means log base 10

223
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,780
and if you're curious, often in computer science settings

224
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,780
log base 2 comes up all the time

225
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,780
so, like I said, in the back of your mind

226
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
if you're trying to think of some of these properties

227
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,780
just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number

228
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,780
that can get you a really far way

229
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
so we're going to start going through a couple of these properties

230
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,780
and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples

231
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,780
so we'll transition away from the pole

232
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,780
and this time to the first proper question

233
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,780
and the question asks you which of the following is true

234
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,780
a. the log of 1000 times x is equal to 3 times the log of x

235
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,780
and remember we're using the convention that it's base 10 log

236
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,780
b. log of 1000 times x equals log of x cubed

237
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,780
c. log of 1000 times x equals 3 plus the log of x

238
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,780
d. log of 1000 times x equals 3 to the power of log of x

239
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,780
and e. none of the above

240
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,780
and remember like I said earlier

241
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,780
we should fully expect that all of those people at the beginning who said they understand logs well

242
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,780
they're going to be answering immediately, they're going to be answering correctly

243
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,780
but if you're someone who doesn't, don't let that intimidate you

244
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,780
when you're looking at a problem like this one

245
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,780
what I would encourage you to do is just plug in various powers of 10

246
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,780
and think in terms of the idea that the log function counts the number of zeros

247
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,780
so I'll give you a little moment to think about that

248
00:21:38,780 --> 00:22:00,780
so I'll go ahead and grade it

249
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,780
and as always if that's faster than what you're comfortable with

250
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,780
know that it's only because I want to proceed forward with the lesson

251
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,780
so in this case the correct answer comes out to be

252
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,780
log of 1000 times x is the same as taking 3 plus the log of x

253
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
and now let's think about that for a moment

254
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,780
and like I said when you're just getting started with them

255
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,780
I think the best thing to do is just be comfortable plugging in various numbers

256
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,780
and the best numbers to plug in are the ones that are already powers of 10

257
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,780
so if you're asking something like log of 1000 times x

258
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,780
well I don't know, let's just plug in something for x

259
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,780
log of 1000 times 100

260
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,780
well we know how many zeros are going to be in the final answer here

261
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,780
well 1000 times 100 is 100,000

262
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,780
we already intuitively have this idea that when we multiply 2 powers of 10

263
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
we're just taking the zeros, the 3 zeros from that 1000

264
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,780
the 2 zeros from that 100 and we're putting them next to each other

265
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,780
so it should be 5 total zeros

266
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,780
but if you really reflect not just on how did the number turn out

267
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
but why did it turn out that way

268
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,780
it was the 3 zeros from that 1000 plus the 2 zeros from that 100

269
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,780
which we could also write by saying

270
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:17,780
the number of zeros in 1000 plus the number of zeros in 100

271
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,780
so this idea that a logarithm of the product of two things

272
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,780
is the sum of the logarithms of those two things

273
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,780
in the context of powers of 10

274
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,780
that's just communicating what's already a super intuitive idea for a lot of us

275
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
if you take 2 powers of 10 and you multiply them

276
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,780
you just take all of their zeros and kind of cram them onto each other

277
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,780
so the way I've written things out here

278
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
it's actually indicative of a slightly more general fact

279
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,780
which is going to be our very first property of logarithms

280
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,780
which is that if we take the log of A times B

281
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,780
it equals the log of A plus the log of B

282
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,780
now any time you see one of these logarithm rules

283
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,780
if you find yourself squinting your eyes

284
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,780
or you're a little bit confused by how to remember it

285
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
just plug in examples

286
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm being redundant, I'm saying this a lot

287
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,780
but it's because I think it's very easy to forget

288
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
once you're swamped in the algebra itself

289
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
and you're sitting on some kind of test and it's just got a lot of symbols

290
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,780
to remind yourself you are okay to just plug in some numbers

291
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
that's a fine thing to do

292
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,780
and often it's a great way to yield intuition

293
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,780
so in this case, saying log of A times B and breaking it apart

294
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,780
we could just think, oh, that log of 100 times 1000

295
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
which is 5, there's 5 zeros in it

296
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,780
breaks up in terms of the number of zeros in each given part

297
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
great, wonderful

298
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,780
so carrying that intuition further

299
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,780
let's try another practice problem

300
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,780
and again, if you know it, great, you'll be able to answer it fine

301
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,780
but maybe think, not just what is the answer

302
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
but how would I explain this answer to someone

303
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,780
or how would I try to get a student to come to this answer on their own

304
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,780
without me having to tell them what the answer is

305
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,780
so there's two potential audience members

306
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,780
there's those who are interested in the lesson itself

307
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,780
and then those who are interested in the meta lesson

308
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,780
so our question asks, again, which of the following is true?

309
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,780
a. log of x to the n is equal to n times log of x

310
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,780
b. log of x to the n is equal to log of x to the power n

311
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,780
c. log of x to the n is equal to n plus log of x

312
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,780
or d. log of x to the n is equal to log of n times log of x

313
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,780
or none of the above

314
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,780
so again, take a moment to answer

315
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,780
as people do answer, we'll start to see them roll in

316
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,780
and if you are struggling to think of where to even start

317
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
just plug in some powers of 10

318
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,780
and see what intuition you might get from it

319
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
so

320
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:36,780
alright, so it looks like just about everybody is landing on one particular answer

321
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
hopefully it's the right answer, like I said, all to be expected

322
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,780
so let's go ahead and see if our majority ended up correct

323
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
and they did!

324
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,780
so the correct answer here is a, which it looks like 4,000 of you got

325
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,780
congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x

326
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,780
so, again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone

327
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,780
or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself

328
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,780
I think a fine place to start is plugging something in

329
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,780
and in this case, for log of x to the power n

330
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,780
let's just try it with 100 to the power 3

331
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,780
and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work

332
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,780
but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is

333
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,780
but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way

334
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,780
sometimes one example will do

335
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,780
because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking

336
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
well, that's 3 copies of 100

337
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm taking 3 copies of 100

338
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,780
and when I multiply all that out

339
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780
and I think of log as counting the number of zeros

340
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,780
we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it

341
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100

342
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,780
I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together

343
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
to get a million

344
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,780
so this number is going to be 6

345
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,780
but if we think actually why was it 6

346
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
not just that's the number of zeros inside the million

347
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
where that 6 came from

348
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,780
is that we had 3 copies of that 100

349
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,780
and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros

350
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,780
so that way it's a more general way you can think about it

351
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,780
where if instead of taking 100 cubed

352
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
we were looking at 1000 cubed

353
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,780
or 1000 to the n

354
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,780
or x to the power n

355
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,780
you can think that it's whatever that value of n was

356
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
the number of copies we were multiplying in

357
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
times the number of

358
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,780
well, let's see, it's not x

359
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,780
times the number of zeros

360
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
that were in whatever we substituted for x

361
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,780
which in this case was 100

362
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
so if instead I had taken something like

363
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,780
log of 10,000 to the power n

364
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,780
this would be the same

365
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,780
as taking n copies of that 10,000

366
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,780
counting the number of zeros in each one of them

367
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,780
which is 4

368
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
so it would be n times 4

369
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,780
and of course the general property

370
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
that most of you correctly answered

371
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,780
is that you have this lovely little effect

372
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,780
where when you see the log of something raised to a power

373
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,780
that little power hops down in front of it

374
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,780
and you just have log of what was on the inside

375
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,780
now one of the maybe most important

376
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
implications of that

377
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,780
I don't know if you'd call it an implication

378
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,780
or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition

379
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
if I'm taking log

380
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,780
and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10

381
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,780
of 10 to the power n

382
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,780
we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front

383
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,780
and it becomes n times the log base 10

384
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
of 10

385
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
which is of course 1

386
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,780
this expression you can think of as either

387
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
counting the number of zeros at the end

388
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,780
or more generally it's asking

389
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,780
10 to the what equals 10

390
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
and the answer is simply 1

391
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
which is very reassuring

392
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,780
because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression

393
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,780
is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n

394
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
oh well the answer is n

395
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,780
ok

396
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
now with every given logarithm property

397
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
that we have

398
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
so in this case we just found one

399
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,780
log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front

400
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,780
there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property

401
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,780
and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves

402
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
a little bit of intuition for these

403
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,780
so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here

404
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,780
try to hide where we're going

405
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,780
what we just found raising something to the n that hops in front

406
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,780
this corresponds to the exponential property

407
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,780
that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n

408
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,780
that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x

409
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,780
and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms

410
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,780
which is they kind of they're like exponentiation turned inside out

411
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
and here's what I mean by that

412
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,780
the thing sitting on the inside of the log

413
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,780
if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression

414
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,780
for something that's exponential

415
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,780
in this case the a the thing on the inside corresponds to 10 to the x

416
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
the output of the function

417
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,780
whereas the entire thing itself

418
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,780
the log of a

419
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,780
corresponds to what's on the inside over here

420
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,780
just what's the exponent of the 10

421
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,780
so wherever you see a log expression here

422
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,780
you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side

423
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,780
and every time you see an exponential

424
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,780
the entire 10 to the x expression

425
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,780
the whole outer component on the right side

426
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,780
that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs

427
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780
and we saw this above

428
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,780
the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside

429
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
that's adding on the outside

430
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,780
well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out

431
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,780
that's telling us that multiplying on the outside

432
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
multiplying the outputs of the function

433
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
is the same as adding on the inside

434
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,780
because each of these logs like log a and log b

435
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,780
is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right

436
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,780
so with that let's keep playing

437
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties

438
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
that we can build up an intuition for

439
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,780
so this last one, very nice thinking of exponents hopping down

440
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,780
the next one is something that might look a little bit weird

441
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,780
to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms

442
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,780
but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it

443
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,780
and we'll give it a little bit more a moment to pull up

444
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,780
which of the following is true?

445
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,780
log base a of b is negative log base b of a

446
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,780
log base a of b is 1 divided by log base b of a

447
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,780
log base a of b is 1 minus log base b of a

448
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,780
log base b of a is log base a of 1 divided by b

449
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,780
or none of the above

450
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,780
so it's asking what happens when we swap the base

451
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,780
with what's sitting inside of the logarithm

452
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,780
and I'll just give you a minute or two to answer that

453
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,780
so

454
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:31,780
okay, so it seems like answers have kind of stabilized out there

455
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
so let's go ahead and grade things

456
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,780
and in this case, the correct answer of the choices we have

457
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
comes out to be b

458
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,780
that the log base a of b involves taking 1 divided by the log base b of a

459
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,780
again, let's think this through both in terms of an example

460
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,780
and then in terms of a more proofy, systematic reason why it should be true

461
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,780
so if we're swapping our bases

462
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,780
let's just start off with

463
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,780
our good old friend log base 10

464
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,780
and let's plug in a nice power of 10 like 1000

465
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,780
counting the number of zeros, we get 3

466
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,780
so let's try swapping the bases and see what this should mean

467
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,780
log base 1000 of 10

468
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,780
okay, well what is this asking?

469
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,780
maybe you think of drawing a little triangle

470
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,780
saying something like we know 1000 to something is equal to 10

471
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,780
1000 to the what equals 10?

472
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,780
well, if 10 cubed is 1000

473
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,780
that is the same thing as saying 10 is equal to 1000

474
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,780
raised to the 1 third

475
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,780
doing the inverse here involves the multiplicative inverse of the exponent

476
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,780
and the way that pans out is that it looks like 1 divided by 3

477
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,780
and that 3 corresponds to the log base 10 of 1000

478
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:05,780
it's 1 divided by the log base 10 of 1000

479
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,780
so more generally, you might guess

480
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,780
based on this single example that when we swap the base with what's on the inside

481
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,780
it corresponds to taking 1 divided by what's on the outside there

482
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,780
and again, you can think this through in terms of

483
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
looking at the corresponding exponential rule

484
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,780
now what happened to my lovely little log and exponentials?

485
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,780
wonderful

486
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
so, again let's hide where some of the things

487
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,780
some of the other properties that we'll get to here

488
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,780
and I'll keep it in the same order I had it before

489
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,780
here I was thinking that having it pre-written could keep me a little bit cleaner than usual

490
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,780
but maybe it just involves playing this weird game of paper cutting shuffling around

491
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,780
so what we just found, log base b of a

492
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,780
if you swap those, it's the same as dividing by 1

493
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
what this corresponds to, off an exponential land

494
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,780
is if you take b to some power

495
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
and say that that equals a

496
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,780
that's the same statement as saying that a to the inverse of that power equals b

497
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,780
again, it's kind of helpful to take a moment and think of the logarithms as turning things inside out

498
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,780
the expression log base b of a is playing the role of that x

499
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:24,780
and the expression log base a of b is playing the role of whatever sits on top of the a

500
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,780
and then symmetrically, the whole expression b to the power x

501
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,780
is playing the role of the inside on the left, it plays the role of the a

502
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,780
and the whole expression, a to the power of something

503
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,780
plays the role of what's sitting inside the log base a

504
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,780
so you can see, just by plugging in some examples and by corresponding it to the exponential rules

505
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,780
we can already think through three different logarithm rules

506
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,780
which if they were just handed down as pieces of algebra to be memorized

507
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
you know, you could memorize them

508
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,780
but it's very easy for them to kind of slip out of your head

509
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,780
and it's also very easy to get frustrated by the task at hand

510
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,780
but you might want to remind yourself that the reason we care about these sorts of things

511
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,780
is understanding the rules of logarithms helps us do math in contexts where it's like a virus growing

512
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,780
where from one day to the next, from one step to the next, things tend to grow multiplicatively

513
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,780
understanding the rules of logarithms helps you to get a better feel for that kind of stuff

514
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,780
so before we do a nice real world example of what that can look like

515
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,780
let me just do one more quiz question in this vein to ask about properties of logarithms

516
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,780
one last one before we transition to a little bit of a real world example

517
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,780
get rid of what we had here

518
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,780
and now, which of the following is true?

519
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,780
log of a plus b is the same as log of a plus log of b

520
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,780
log of a plus b is equal to log of a times log of b

521
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,780
log of a plus b is equal to one divided by log of a plus log of b

522
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:04,780
or log of a plus b is equal to one divided by log of a times log of b or none of the above

523
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,780
ah, and now we don't have as much consensus, do we?

524
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,780
very interesting, we've got a horse race between two

525
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,780
so I will give you a moment to think this through

526
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,780
while people are answering, actually I have a little question for the audience

527
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:58,780
so, you know, I was just talking about how we might think in terms of multiplicative growth

528
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,780
and that doesn't just have to be powers of ten, we could also do something like powers of three

529
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:10,780
where if you're going from one to three to nine to twenty-seven to eighty-one, all of these

530
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:18,780
we could say that the log base three of these numbers just grows in nice little steps

531
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,780
so log base three of one, three to the what equals one, the answer is zero

532
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,780
in general the log of one, no matter the base, will be zero

533
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,780
log base three of three, three to the what equals three is one

534
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,780
similarly log base three of nine is two

535
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,780
ah, you might wonder what my question is, but it'll help to draw all of these out

536
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,780
and for my own pleasure here, let me just write out one more

537
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
log base three of eighty-one is four

538
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,780
now, I've heard that ostensibly if you ask a child, let's say around like five or six years old

539
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,780
what number is halfway between one and nine

540
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,780
you say what number is halfway

541
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,780
their instincts for how to answer are logarithmic

542
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
whereas our instincts tend to be more linear

543
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,780
so we often think one and nine, you've got a bunch of evenly spaced numbers between them

544
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

545
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,780
and if you go right halfway in between, you'll land on five

546
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,780
but if you're thinking in terms of multiplicative growth

547
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,780
where to get from one to nine, it's not a matter of adding a bunch of things

548
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,780
but you're growing by a certain amount

549
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,780
you grow by a factor of three, then you grow by another factor of three

550
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,780
supposedly, a kid's natural instinct lines up with saying three

551
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,780
and supposedly this also lines up with

552
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,780
if you have anthropologists studying societies that haven't developed

553
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,780
accounting systems and writing in the same way that modern societies have

554
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,780
they'll answer three for this

555
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
so, my question for the audience

556
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,780
if any of you watching right now have access to a small child

557
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,780
let's say, in the range of five years old

558
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,780
see if you can go ask them what number is halfway between one and nine

559
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,780
and if you can, let us know on Twitter what the child says

560
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
what their actual answer is

561
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,780
because I don't know why, I'm just a little bit skeptical of whether that actually pans out in practice

562
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,780
I understand this is not a super scientific way to do it

563
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,780
I'm not asking people watching a YouTube livestream to survey their own children

564
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
and then tweet the answer

565
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,780
but for my own sake it would be interesting to see some kind of validation there

566
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
back to our question

567
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,780
this is the first one that doesn't seem to have a huge consensus in one direction

568
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,780
let's go ahead and grade it to see what the answer turns out to be

569
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,780
great, okay, so

570
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,780
2,400 of you correctly answered that it's none of the above

571
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,780
that log of a plus b doesn't satisfy any of these nice properties

572
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,780
and in general, unless we're going to be working with certain kinds of approximations

573
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
especially when the natural log comes into play

574
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
we might talk about this next time

575
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,780
adding the inputs of a logarithm is actually a very weird sensation

576
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,780
it's a very weird thing to do

577
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,780
and to get a sense of that weirdness, plug in some powers of ten

578
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:02,780
if I ask you log of a plus b

579
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,780
what you might start thinking is, okay, let me just plug in some examples

580
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,780
like 10,000 and 100

581
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,780
and I ask myself, if I do this zero counting function of what's in that input

582
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
how many zeros are in it?

583
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,780
but it's weird, because when we add 10,100

584
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
well, we're no longer at a clean power of ten

585
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,780
and okay, that's fine, you know, often you're taking logarithms of things that aren't clean powers of ten

586
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:37,780
but it becomes very strange to ask how you express this in terms of log of 100

587
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,780
which was two

588
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,780
and log of 10,000

589
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,780
which was four

590
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,780
because if you look at log of 10,100, it's asking ten to the what is equal to 10,100

591
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,780
you might say, I don't know, it's going to be a little above four

592
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,780
because it's kind of close to 10,000

593
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:06,780
so the best you might guess here is, oh, this is going to be something that's kind of like the log of 10,000

594
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,780
but that just feels like a coincidence based on the two numbers that we happened to put in

595
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
there's not a nice systematic reason coming there

596
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,780
so maybe you guess, oh, if the numbers a and b are very different

597
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,780
it's kind of close to whatever the maximum of them is

598
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
but it's very bizarre

599
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,780
and most importantly, for the sake of the quiz

600
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
if you just look at the options that it's giving you

601
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,780
if you try this out with any particular numbers, you'll find that none of those actually work

602
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,780
so, all is good

603
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,780
sometimes you get something that looks like it's going to be a nice property

604
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
but it doesn't end up being a nice property

605
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
and I also think that's important

606
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:46,780
rather than just finding yourself only working with the various, you know, log of a times b

607
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
or log of x to the power n

608
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,780
these things that have a nice rule

609
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,780
sometimes you're out in the mathematical wild, you're working on some problem

610
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,780
you have a logarithm expression and it's adding things in the input

611
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,780
and you want to be able to have familiarity with the fact that that's kind of weird

612
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,780
that you're not going to be able to simplify

613
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,780
but if you, you know, if you hadn't thought about that before

614
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,780
you might wonder, oh, is there just some formula that I haven't seen before

615
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,780
so with all of that, let me go ahead and take a couple questions from the audience

616
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,780
before we transition to a different sort of example

617
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
so it looks like Uma Sherma asks

618
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,780
can the base be zero?

619
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,780
that's an interesting question

620
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,780
okay, can the base of a logarithm be zero?

621
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,780
well in terms of our triangle we might think of that as saying

622
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:35,780
you know, zero to some kind of power x is equal to some other value y

623
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,780
this is something that we could write either by saying zero to the x equals y

624
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:47,780
or we could write the same thing by saying log base zero of y is equal to x

625
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,780
zero to the what equals x

626
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,780
now the issue here is that zero to anything ends up being zero

627
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:00,780
right, so if we're just going to be thinking of log base zero of y

628
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,780
for any other input y

629
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,780
you know, you want to input something like one or two or pi

630
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,780
anything you might want, you're asking the question

631
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,780
zero to the what is equal to one or two or pi

632
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,780
or whatever number you might have there

633
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,780
and there's just not going to be an answer

634
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,780
so at best you could try to say

635
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,780
oh yes, log of zero, it's a perfectly valid function

636
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,780
it's only defined on the input zero

637
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,780
but even then you'd have trouble trying to finagle what you want there

638
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,780
because saying zero to the what equals zero

639
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,780
it's like anything applies to it

640
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,780
so your arm is going to be twisted behind your back however you want to make that work

641
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,780
and it corresponds to the fact that the exponential function

642
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,780
with base zero is entirely zero

643
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:53,780
it doesn't map numbers in a nice one to one fashion onto each other

644
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,780
so that's a great question, can you have a log base zero

645
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,780
now back to the idea of where these things come up in the real world

646
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,780
one example I kind of like is the Richter scale for earthquakes

647
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:12,780
so the Richter scale gives us a quantification for how strong an earthquake is

648
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,780
and it can be anything from very small numbers up to very large numbers

649
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,780
like I think the largest earthquake ever measured

650
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,780
and this is just a chart that comes from Wikipedia

651
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,780
was a 9.5

652
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,780
and to appreciate just how insane that is

653
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,780
it's worth looking at the relationship between what these numbers mean

654
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,780
and then something like the equivalent amount of TNT

655
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,780
some sort of measure of how much energy there is in it

656
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,780
and then what we can try to do here is

657
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,780
see if we can get an expression for the Richter scale number

658
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,780
in terms of the amount of energy

659
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,780
and why logarithms would be a natural way to describe this

660
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,780
so the key to focus on is as we're taking steps forward

661
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,780
how much do things increase

662
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,780
so for example if we go from two

663
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,780
well in this case it doesn't show us where three is

664
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,780
so maybe we think of taking a step from two up to four

665
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
which is kind of like taking two steps

666
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,780
what does that do in terms of the amount of energy

667
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,780
well it looks like it takes us from one metric ton of TNT

668
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,780
which is I guess a large bomb from World War II

669
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,780
and it takes us up to a kiloton

670
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,780
a thousand times as much

671
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,780
which is a small atom bomb

672
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,780
so just two steps on the Richter scale

673
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,780
going from an earthquake of magnitude 2 to an earthquake of magnitude 4

674
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,780
takes us from large bomb from World War II up to the nuclear age

675
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,780
so that is noteworthy

676
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,780
and the first clean step that we get is going from 4 to 5

677
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,780
at least in terms of what this chart is nicely showing us

678
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,780
and evidently a single step up from 4 to 5

679
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,780
corresponds to going from 1 kiloton to 32 kilotons

680
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,780
and that was evidently the size of the city destroying bomb that landed on Nagasaki

681
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,780
so this is maybe one thing that can be counterintuitive about logarithmic scales

682
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,780
if you're just hearing in the news the difference between

683
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,780
oh there was an earthquake that was a 4.0

684
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,780
versus an earthquake that was a 5.0

685
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,780
it's easy to think yeah 4 and 5 those are pretty similar numbers

686
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,780
but evidently in terms of TNT amounts

687
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,780
that corresponds to multiplying by 32 to get from 1 to the next

688
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:18,780
and going from 2 to 4 was evidently multiplying by about a thousand

689
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,780
and the only reason that's bigger is because here our chart wasn't showing what 3 was

690
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,780
so we were taking two steps

691
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,780
and you can verify for yourself that if you take a step of 32

692
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,780
and then you multiply by another 32 that's actually pretty close to a thousand

693
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,780
so the idea that additive steps on the Richter number

694
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,780
correspond to multiplicative steps in the TNT

695
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,780
seems to suggest that something logarithmic is at play here

696
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,780
and it's a little interesting to just keep going here

697
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,780
and say how much does this grow

698
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,780
partly because of the world phenomena it's describing

699
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,780
yes not a huge surprise that as we take another step

700
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,780
it's multiplying by about 32 again

701
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,780
but reining that in to our intuitions

702
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,780
that's the difference between 32 kilotons a small atom bomb

703
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,780
and then one megaton which we might think of as

704
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,780
not small atom bomb, Nagasaki atom bomb

705
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,780
which I guess is 32 of the Nagasaki atom bombs for one megaton

706
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,780
that is evidently the magnitude of the double string flat earthquake in Nevada USA 1994

707
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,780
I didn't know what that was, thanks Wikipedia

708
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,780
in terms of frequencies by the way I also looked these up

709
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,780
evidently ones that are less than two, those happen all the time

710
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,780
there's like 8000 of those per day

711
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,780
but as soon as we're in the realm of atom bombs

712
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,780
things like 3.5 and 4

713
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,780
those evidently also happen quite frequently somewhere on the earth

714
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,780
there's around 134 of those happening somewhere every day

715
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,780
who knew?

716
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,780
but as we get even more intense into this 5 and 6 range

717
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,780
which were well above the atom bomb scale

718
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,780
now we're only merely at around 2 per day

719
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,780
and I'm sure that a geologist could come in and explain why we all shouldn't be super worried

720
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:09,780
about the fact that there's two atom bomb equivalent disruptions to the earth's crust happening every day

721
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,780
but presumably it's particularly rare for those to be concentrated on some spot

722
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,780
like a city where lots of people live

723
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,780
now just verifying our thought that each step involves a growth of 32

724
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,780
let's look at what the step from 6 up to 7 looks like

725
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,780
and here it's giving us lots more examples in between

726
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,780
maybe giving the illusion that that's a bigger step than it actually is

727
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,780
and indeed that's the difference between 1 megaton and 32 megatons

728
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,780
so that's multiplying by 32

729
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,780
one of the things I found most interesting on this chart by the way

730
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:49,780
was look at how far we have to go before we get to the largest nuclear weapon that's ever actually been tested

731
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,780
this was height of the cold war

732
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,780
the Tsar bomb that was 50 megatons

733
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,780
and I believe they actually had original plans to have a 100 megaton bomb

734
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,780
but talked themselves down from that

735
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,780
50 megatons, we're talking start off at that 32 kilotons of the Nagasaki bomb

736
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,780
multiply by 32 to get a megaton

737
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,780
multiply by another 32

738
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:16,780
so we're talking about a thousand times the strength of the World War II ending explosion

739
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,780
and you're still not at the 50 megatons of what humanity is capable of

740
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,780
and that is evidently the Java earthquake of Indonesia

741
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,780
so 7.0 is not just a little bit bigger than 6.0, it's a lot bigger

742
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,780
and the point here of course is just that when you have a scale giving you multiplicative increases

743
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,780
it's worth appreciating that what look like small steps can actually be huge steps in terms of the energy implied

744
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,780
or the absolute values implied here

745
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,780
so when we're thinking about the fact that there was ever a 9.5

746
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,780
that actually seems absurd given that it's only in the 7.0 range that we're talking about

747
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,780
the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out

748
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,780
and this is indicative of one area where logarithms tend to come about

749
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:05,780
it's when humans want to create a scale for something that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be

750
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,780
so in the case of size of earthquakes

751
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,780
you can have things from what happens just all the time around the Earth, the size of a large hand grenade

752
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,780
and you want that to be on your scale and something to think about

753
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:22,780
ranging all the way up to the largest disruption that we've seen in human history

754
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,780
and in order to have that in a way that you're not just writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case

755
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,780
and a whole bunch of different, a smaller number of digits for your number in another case

756
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:39,780
it's nice to take logarithms and then just put that on a single scale that basically squishes those numbers between 0 and 10

757
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,780
you see something very similar going on with the decibel scale for music

758
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:49,780
that one actually works a little bit differently where every time you take a step up of 10 decibels

759
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,780
that corresponds to multiplying by 10

760
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,780
so rather than a step of 1 multiplying by 10, it's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10

761
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,780
so that kind of makes the math of it a little bit screwy

762
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:04,780
but the idea is the same, that if you're listening to a sound that's 50 decibels versus 60 decibels

763
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,780
it's a lot quieter in terms of the energy being transmitted

764
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,780
and going from, what would it be, 60 to 70 or 70 to 80

765
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:19,780
those steps, from 60 up to 80, that involves multiplying the amount of energy per square area by a factor of 100

766
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:26,780
so every time you see a logarithmic scale, know in your mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount

767
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:31,780
this is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus outbreak

768
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:40,780
so how might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the Richter scale number by 1, you're multiplying by 32

769
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,780
well, we could think in terms of a log with base 32

770
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:53,780
I could say if I take the log of, I'm just going to call r, the number for the Richter scale

771
00:53:53,780 --> 00:54:01,780
I might think of this as log base 32 and that's going to correspond to, no no no, I'm doing this wrong

772
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,780
that's not the thing that's logged

773
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:14,780
we take the log base 32 of the big number, of the TMT number, something that was like 1 megaton

774
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,780
it's 1 million tons

775
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:25,780
the log base 32, that should correspond to the Richter scale number

776
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:33,780
but there might be some kind of offset, so we might say that there's some kind of constant s that we're adding to this Richter scale number

777
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:39,780
and this expression is exactly the same, excuse me for going off the bottom there

778
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:47,780
this expression is exactly the same as saying 32 to the power of some offset times our Richter scale number

779
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:59,780
which is the same as taking 32 to that offset, which itself is just some big constant, times 32 to the Richter scale number

780
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:05,780
so you might think of this as just being some constant times 32 to the power of the number you see

781
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,780
so this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it

782
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:18,780
that if this is what corresponds to the TMT amount that you see, as you increase that r step by step you're multiplying by 32

783
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:26,780
but another way of communicating the exact same fact is to take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is

784
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:34,780
alright now the next thing I want to talk about is how we don't always have to worry about how to compute logs of different bases

785
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:41,780
it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32, I referenced earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e

786
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,780
computer scientists really like to have a log with base 2

787
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:51,780
and it turns out for computational purposes or for also thinking about how these things grow

788
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,780
if you have one log, if you're able to compute one type of log, whether that's base 10, base 2, base e

789
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,780
you can compute pretty much anything else that you want

790
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:07,780
now to get our intuitions in that direction, let's turn back to our quiz and go to the next question

791
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:15,780
and I believe that this question is the most, I don't know, this is a halfway reasonable question, this should be nice

792
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:22,780
this is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2 context to base 10 context

793
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,780
and it's also a good intuition for understanding powers of 2 to have in general

794
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,780
the relationship that it has with powers of 10

795
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:35,780
because it's this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that these two sort of

796
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,780
well you'll see what I mean, they play nicely with each other

797
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:46,780
so our question asks, given the fact that 2 to the 10th is 1024, 1024, which is approximately 1000

798
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,780
so if you're being a little bit loose with your numbers and you're just making approximations

799
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:55,780
2 to the 10th, basically 1000, which of the following is closest to being true?

800
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,780
log base 2 of 10 is approximately 0.3

801
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:05,780
log base 2 of 10 is approximately, sorry, log base 10 of 2 is approximately 0.3

802
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,780
log base 2 of 10 is approximately 1 third

803
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,780
or log base 10 of 2 is approximately 1 third

804
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,780
which of these is closest to being true based on the fact that 2 to the 10th is essentially 1000?

805
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,780
I'll give you a little moment for that

806
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:52,780
interesting that we've got kind of a split on this one

807
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,780
so I'm wondering if they're going to be numerically pretty similar

808
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,780
or if they're going to be conceptually similar

809
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,780
or if there's even a difference between those two

810
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,780
so since answers keep rolling in, I'm going to give this a little bit more time

811
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,780
so anyone at home watching, hopefully you already have a pencil and paper out

812
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,780
to be noodling through these yourself, that is the spirit of the lectures that we're doing

813
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,780
if you don't, now is the time to take out a pencil and paper

814
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,780
and see if you can think this one through and write it out

815
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,780
some of the problems that we're going to build to here definitely will require pencil and paper

816
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,780
so now is as good a time as any

817
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,780
and if you're watching this in the future, even if you can't participate in the live poll

818
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,780
I really do think it's a lot of fun to kind of throw your own hat into the mix

819
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,780
even if it's not going to contribute to one of the numbers that you see growing on the screen

820
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,780
I'll give you a little bit more time here as the answers seem to continue rolling in

821
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,780
so now is the time to take out your pencil and paper

822
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,780
and see if you can think this one through

823
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,780
and write it out

824
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,780
so now is as good a time as any

825
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,780
and if you can think this one through

826
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,780
then you can think this one through

827
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,780
and write it out

828
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,780
so now is as good a time as any

829
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,780
and if you can think this one through

830
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:56,660
and then do your Move

831
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,780
Ok, so I'll go ahead and grade it now

832
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,160
and let's see how people did on this one

833
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,920
so the correct answer is B

834
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,940
which is that the log base 10 of 2 Welcome!

835
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:13,860
tender. Not at all a unanimous decision here. Looks like it was D, which is that

836
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,340
the log base 10 of 2 is around 1 third. So that's good, they're very numerically

837
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:23,620
similar, right? That it's either 0.3 or around 1 third, which is 0.3333 repeating.

838
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,500
But the question was asking which one is closest to being true, and let's see how

839
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:33,620
we can think about this. So it points out that you have a power of 2, which is

840
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:39,180
1024, awfully close to a power of 10, about 10 cubed. And the question is how

841
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:44,800
we can leverage this to understand something like log base 2 of 10, or log

842
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,940
base 10 of 2. As we saw earlier, those are just the reciprocals of each other. So

843
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,660
what does this mean? If log base 2 of 10 is equal to x, that's the same thing as

844
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:58,500
saying 2 to the x is equal to 10, right? It's asking us 2 to the what equals 10.

845
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:05,380
So what we have here is an expression 10 cubed is approximately equal to 2 to

846
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:10,460
the 10. So what I might write out is we know that 2 to the 10, instead of writing

847
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:17,540
it as a 10, I'm going to write that 10 as 2 to the x, where x is the number such

848
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:23,640
that 2 to the x is approximate is equal to 10. So if that cubed is the same as 2

849
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:28,380
to the 10th, this is, I'll just write out the full details, the same as saying 2

850
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:34,740
to the 3x is equal to 2 to the 10th. And exponentiation is a nice one-to-one

851
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:39,980
function, so it's okay to just say whatever is going on in the input, if the

852
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,100
outputs are the same, the inputs must also be the same. You can't do that with

853
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,140
every function. People seem to think you can do that with any function, but you

854
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:55,580
just can't. And what that means is that x is about 10 thirds, okay?

855
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:03,620
Which, great, so log base 2 of 10 is about 10 thirds. So if we looked at our answers

856
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,420
though, that's not actually any of the options. We've got various things asking

857
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:13,420
log base 2 of 10 being around 0.3 or 1 third, so it looks like instead we should

858
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:18,940
try to re-express this as log base 10 of 2. And well enough, what we saw earlier is

859
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:27,020
that log base 2 of 10, we could also say log base 10 of 2 is just 1 over that

860
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:31,380
amount, 1 over x. And you can see this pretty easily by writing 2 is equal to

861
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,820
10 to the 1 over x. If we're asking 10 to the what equals 2, the answer is 1 over

862
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:44,920
what we just got there. So log base 10 of 2 is 1 divided by this amount, which is

863
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:52,520
3 tenths, which is 0.3. Great. So this is kind of a nice constant to think about

864
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,880
because there's this wonderful pattern that happens when we're looking at

865
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:03,560
powers of 2. So if I ask what is the log base 2 of a thousand, like we just saw,

866
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:09,000
it's approximately the case that 2 to the power 10 is equal to a thousand. And

867
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,400
because we're doing things at logs I'm just going to be writing it in that way.

868
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:21,320
Log 2 of a thousand is approximately 10. Similarly log base 2 of a million, well

869
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,640
let's see, if we have to multiply 2 by itself about 10 times to get to a

870
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,600
thousand, we should have to multiply it by itself around 20 times to get up to a

871
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,360
million. And indeed log base 2 of a million is approximately 20. It's a

872
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,400
little bit smaller but this is kind of a nice approximation to have in your mind.

873
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,880
And then similarly, you'll see why I'm writing out this as a pattern in just a

874
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,320
moment, if we wanted to go up to a billion, saying how many times do I have

875
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,360
to multiply 2 by itself to get to a billion, this is about 30. And any

876
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,000
computer scientist out there who's thought about, you know, just how much is

877
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,760
a kilobyte or a megabyte or a gigabyte, they'll be familiar with the idea that

878
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,400
powers of 2 are nice and close to these powers of 10, or more specifically powers

879
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,160
of a thousand. Now what I want to do is just write all of the same things with

880
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:18,640
log base 10, not approximately equal to, this is actually equal to 3. Log base

881
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,040
10 of a thousand is equal to 3. Log base 10, well you tell me, what's log base 10

882
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:30,240
of a million? It's counting the number of zeros, it ends up being about 6. And log

883
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:36,920
base 10 of a billion, counting the number of zeros, it ends up being 9. Now

884
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,600
the reason I wanted to write all of this out is to just emphasize an interesting

885
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,240
pattern here, which is we're just growing by these increments, right, as we go from

886
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,160
a thousand to a million to a billion with log base 2, we're stepping up by

887
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:55,080
steps of 10, but when we're playing the same game with 10, we're stepping up by

888
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,100
these increments of 3. So there's this nice relationship, and in fact for all of

889
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:03,980
them, to go from log base 2 to log base 10, it seems like we're just multiplying

890
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:12,340
by 0.3. So 10 times 0.3 is 3. 20, we scale down by that same amount. 30, we scale

891
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:19,540
down by that same amount. Okay? Now this is an intuition worth remembering. If you

892
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,380
have your numbers described with one base, it's basically the same as

893
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:28,580
describing them with another base, but there's some rescaling constant. Okay? And

894
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,300
then the next question is going to start getting us at that direction, but it's

895
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,340
going to be framed in a way that just looks like a whole pile of algebra, and

896
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,940
again I will encourage you to plug in numbers if you want to to gain a little

897
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:45,020
intuition for it. So as our third to last question, this will be a long lecture, we

898
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:50,820
have which of the following is true? And then just a whole pile of various

899
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:56,580
possible ways to combine log base C of B times log base C of A. Does that equal

900
01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:00,740
log base B of A? And rather than me reading them out to you, I'll just

901
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:04,140
let you look through them, plug in some numbers. I'll give you a

902
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:08,460
meaningful time on this one because it's not obvious unless you're

903
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:14,100
already familiar with logarithms, and it's worth thinking through a little bit.

904
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:30,300
We have an outstanding question from the audience, which is does the bar length

905
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,040
of the pole use some kind of log function? And helpfully it looks like

906
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,420
Ben Eater has gone ahead and directly answered in the form of the code

907
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:45,180
involved, where the chart max is the raising 2 to the power of a

908
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:51,140
ceiling of a log base 2 of the maximum attempt count, which I think is to say

909
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:56,060
unraveling. If you're looking at the maximum number, I'm not great at

910
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:00,420
Vanna Whiting this thing, if you look at the maximum number in our poll, it's

911
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:05,260
asking what's the log base 2 of that, so as it crosses different powers of 2 then

912
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:11,220
that rescales it, and yes, yes is the answer. What a fantastically apropos

913
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:17,460
question. Thank You Karen. All right so answers are still rolling in, and I think

914
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,820
like I said I just want to give you some more time to think this through because

915
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,740
it looks like a big pile of algebra. Plug in some numbers to see what seems to

916
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:31,860
work well and see which answer fits.

917
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,320
you

918
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,320
you

919
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,320
you

920
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,060
okay so even if you are still thinking about it I'm gonna go ahead and grade it

921
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:46,340
here and then start talking about why it's true and then also why we should

922
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,140
care why this is an operation that actually tells us something so the

923
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:55,340
correct answer which it looks like around 1700 of you got congratulations is

924
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:04,640
log base C of B times log base B of A is equal to log base C of A great now

925
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,800
that's just a big ol pile of things why would that be true how do we think about

926
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,560
it now phase one like I said we might plug in an example but let's try to

927
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:18,080
actually think about why the example holds so let me pull out we've got this

928
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:24,520
as one more of the log rules this is just repeating the end what the correct

929
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:29,800
answer turned out to be where we've got an expression for log base C of B log

930
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,160
base B of A and this ends up being log base C of A it's gotten rid of the B's

931
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,120
which is kind of interesting so some examples you might plug in here would be

932
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:47,280
things like let's use a different color let's use green instead of C I'm gonna

933
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:53,080
go ahead and plug in 10 log base 10 of 100 which is kind of asking how many

934
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,800
times does 10 go into an 100 in a multiplicative sense how many times do I

935
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,960
multiply 10 by itself to get to 100 where the answer is 2 and then log of

936
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,360
100 of let's plug in another power of 10 it'll be nice if it's also a power of

937
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:15,720
100 so I'll do a million so this one is asking 10 100 to the what equals a

938
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,080
million how many times do I multiply a hundred by itself to get to a million

939
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:23,240
how many times does a hundred go into a million phrasing the same thing ten

940
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,560
different ways now the claim is that this is the same thing as taking log

941
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:36,120
base 10 of a million that if I ask how many times does 10 go into 100 and how

942
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,160
many times does 100 go into a million multiplying those should give me the

943
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:45,520
answer to how many times 10 goes into a million now just checking the numbers

944
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:53,440
this certainly works 10 goes into a hundred two times 100 goes into a

945
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,640
million three times in a multiplicative sense in that a hundred cubed is equal

946
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:06,440
to a million and indeed how many times does 10 go into a million well six now

947
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,880
we could think of this property in terms of the corresponding exponent rule which

948
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,720
is going to look a little bit stranger but it's actually just saying the

949
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:19,720
entirely the same thing so here we're if we have a base of C and a base of B and

950
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,160
we're trying to relate those to each other the whole statement is equal to

951
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:29,240
saying that um suppose that B to the X is equal to a got some number B you

952
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,040
raise it to some number X and equals a suppose it's also the case that C to the

953
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:38,840
Y equals B those two together are the same as saying C to the XY equals a now

954
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,020
that's kind of a mouthful to say out loud but if you plug in some numbers to

955
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,680
translate what all of that is really saying in the context of the example we

956
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,280
just did saying if you can write a hundred is ten squared and if you can

957
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,120
write a million as a hundred cubed well that lets you write a million in terms

958
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,380
of a power of ten okay so sort of asking this question how many times does one

959
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:06,960
number go into another but letting you layer it on top of each other now if we

960
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,240
rearrange that expression we get what is probably the second most important of

961
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,680
all of our log rules the most important is this top one that when you multiply

962
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,240
the inputs you add the outputs but the second most important which is known as

963
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:26,560
the change of base formula lets us rate that if you want the log base B of some

964
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,280
value a then for whatever C you want it doesn't actually matter what log you

965
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,280
have in your pocket if you use that other log and you take the log C of a

966
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:41,480
divided by the log C of B that gives you log base B of a okay so just as an

967
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,560
example here what this would look like is let's say I wanted to be able to

968
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,600
compute log base 100 of things I just really want to it's not a button on my

969
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:56,160
calculator but I would love to be able to do it and I want to do it in with an

970
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:00,440
input like a million well even if I don't have the log base 100 button on my

971
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:07,700
calculator what I can do is say I'll use the log base 10 button and evaluate

972
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:12,860
what's on the inside here which at least positionally it's kind of above the 100

973
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:18,460
it has a higher altitude as we write it so this can line up with the notation a

974
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:23,980
little bit that it sits on the numerator and on the bottom I use the log base 10

975
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:29,420
button that's in my calculator on the base on the 100 and then I can evaluate

976
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:32,300
both of those and it'll give me the answer in this case it gets you 6 divided

977
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:38,100
by 2 which will be 3 and if we really just think through what this is saying I

978
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,980
know I've said it many different times but it's a it's a convoluted enough way

979
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:46,220
to write things but an intuitive enough fact that I think just coming at it from

980
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:49,060
a bunch of different angles can be important because like I said this is

981
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:54,060
probably the second most important log rule we're asking how many times does 100

982
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:58,820
go into a million in a multiplicative sense how many times they multiply by

983
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:03,820
itself but division is asking that same question in an additive sense if I say

984
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:08,500
how many times does the log of 100 go into the log of a million that's what

985
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,380
division means it's saying how many times do I add this bottom number to

986
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:16,340
itself to get to the top but anything additive in the logarithm realm is the

987
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,700
same as anything multiplicative in terms of what's inside the parentheses so both

988
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,140
of the left-hand side and the right-hand side are just saying how many times does

989
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:28,980
100 go into a million but going about that in different ways so this is

990
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:32,500
extremely nice because it actually lets us compute things next time we're going

991
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:38,260
to talk all about the natural logarithm which is log base e often written ln and

992
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:43,420
turns out this is much easier to compute there's nice math behind it such that if

993
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,700
you want to come up with an algorithm that your calculator can use it's

994
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:50,340
actually a lot easier to think of log base e of numbers so anytime that you

995
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,460
need to go to some kind of calculator I don't know let's say we popped over to

996
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:59,100
something like Desmos always happy to have as a friend and you wanted to

997
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:04,500
compute log base 10 of some number you know let's say we're doing log base 10

998
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,380
of 57 and it looks like that's you know it should make sense it's between 1 and

999
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:14,940
2 because 57 was between 10 and 100 what's going on under the hood how is it

1000
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:18,660
actually figuring this out it's going to use somewhere in there a change of base

1001
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:24,540
formula which is going to be that the natural log of 57 divided by the natural

1002
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:28,580
log of 10 is the same thing these are two different ways of writing it so if

1003
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:34,980
you know one logarithm you know all of the logarithms okay and well let's just

1004
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:38,460
use that fact to answer one more of our quiz questions and this will be the

1005
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:43,260
second to last quiz question so thank you all for sticking it through I think

1006
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:48,060
we will be I think you'll be pleased by the last question because the last

1007
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,740
question will actually be like a fun problem-solving puzzle II thing and it

1008
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,820
will involve a lot of what we've used up to this point kind of a culminating

1009
01:15:54,820 --> 01:16:00,460
thing so before that though just to make sure that we've got the instincts of

1010
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:07,220
change of base down what do we have use the approximation that log base 2 of 10

1011
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:11,940
is around 10 thirds so using that approximation which of the following is

1012
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:19,060
approximately true log base 2 of X is about 10 thirds of log base 10 of X log

1013
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:26,140
base 2 of X is log base 10 of 10 thirds of X log base 2 of X is log base 10 of X

1014
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:31,420
to the power 10 thirds or log base 2 of X is 10 thirds times the log base 10 of

1015
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:36,460
X and finally none of the above so I'll give you a moment to think about that

1016
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:39,420
you might want to think to the chart that we were drawing earlier and

1017
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:44,500
thinking about log base 2 and log base 10 as we're looking at powers of 1000

1018
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:48,900
and how each of those grows that can leverage some of the intuition but I'll

1019
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:52,460
let you think about it stop talking

1020
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,480
you

1021
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:21,980
while answers are rolling in it looks like a number of people have been asking

1022
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:27,540
on Twitter about basically how complex numbers play into this so you know we've

1023
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:33,340
got Jamil asking what if the base is imaginary we've got Kalkan asking what

1024
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,940
about complex bases since e to the X is walking around the spiral wouldn't it

1025
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:41,300
hit every complex number we won't hit every complex number but your instinct

1026
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,140
that it's hitting multiple things is pretty spot-on doesn't make sense to

1027
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:49,460
talk about logs with imaginary numbers by Nitya so to all of these questions

1028
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:56,220
it's actually a very nuanced question the short answer is yes complex log

1029
01:17:56,220 --> 01:18:00,700
rhythms absolutely exist but each one of them has multiple different outputs so a

1030
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:05,820
good a good analogy here is how if we have the square root function if I ask

1031
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,500
something like the square root of 5 you know we have the convention that you

1032
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,020
always do the positive amount but that doesn't quite feel honest it feels like

1033
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:17,820
the right answer is to specify that there's two different outputs for the

1034
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:24,940
square root function two solutions to x squared equals 25 and this is actually

1035
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:28,620
true in complex numbers as well one of the things we talked about in a complex

1036
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,300
number lecture was that you can take the square root of I and you actually get

1037
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:39,020
root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I but that there's two solutions you can do

1038
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,980
plus or minus this value and so you could say that the square root function

1039
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,500
isn't a function but it's a multi-valued function it always has two different

1040
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:52,540
outputs now something funky happens when we have exponents at play so if you're

1041
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,940
just like someone who hasn't seen this stuff don't worry we talked about it in

1042
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:59,580
previous lectures I'm obviously jumping around on the complexity level a lot

1043
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:04,060
here where if in lecture five I'm talking about like Euler's formula with

1044
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:07,020
complex numbers and compound interest and like how that plays into physics and

1045
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,300
then lecture six we're back to the basics of logarithms I acknowledge that

1046
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:15,460
might be a little bit jarring to potential audience members but just

1047
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:23,520
continuing on with the answer if you note that e to the 2 pi times you know

1048
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:30,920
some number times I this basically walks you around a circle so that the

1049
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,520
output will walk around a circle and just keep repeating as n goes from 0 up

1050
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,600
to 1 it'll walk around one cycle and end up back where you started as n goes from

1051
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:45,600
1 to 2 you'll end up back where you started so for example e to the 0 sits

1052
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:54,600
here e to the I pi is at negative 1 but e to the 2 pi I is also at 1 same with

1053
01:19:54,600 --> 01:20:06,600
e excuse me same with e to the 4 pi I that also equals 1 so in general if you

1054
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:14,240
wanted to ask something like what is the log base e of 1 you know the one hand we

1055
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,640
want to say the log of log base anything of 1 should be 0 because

1056
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,160
anything to the power 0 equals that 1 but if we're letting complex numbers

1057
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:26,320
into the mix you would have to honestly say well 2 pi I is another pretty good

1058
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:31,260
answer to this question because e to the 2 pi I also equals 1 and same with 4 pi

1059
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:36,280
I and you could even go in the negative direction and in general n times pi

1060
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:46,120
times 2 times I kind of wrote that in a weird order for any integer in feels

1061
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,720
like a valid answer to this question so there's a couple ways that you can deal

1062
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:54,480
with that in math and before we get back to our usual lesson just on logarithm

1063
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,640
rules this is interesting enough I kind of want to pull it up let's see what if

1064
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:05,720
we have complex logarithm great Wikipedia always to our aid probably

1065
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:10,040
it'll have a nice like visual of some kind for us look such fancy color

1066
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:15,000
diagrams what I want okay this is what I want wonderful let's zoom out a little

1067
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,400
bit great so there's this notion of what's called a Riemann surface that's

1068
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,080
basically trying to capture the idea that you have a function with multiple

1069
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,040
outputs and intuitively maybe you can understand what it's getting at where

1070
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,800
the input would be something on the XY plane and the output there's just many

1071
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,480
different outputs sitting there so when you have a complex logarithm you have to

1072
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,920
account for that but it's used it's actually a very useful idea to do but it

1073
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,560
takes a lot more nuance than than you might expect so with all of that

1074
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,520
hopefully that helped at least partially answer some of people's questions same

1075
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,240
same by the way with logarithms with based negative numbers because if you're

1076
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,000
asking like negative 1 to the X and really noodling on what that means it's

1077
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,260
it gets you into the realm of complex numbers so you have to deal with the

1078
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:06,900
same multiple output idea now answers are rolling in more slowly so this seems

1079
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:13,860
like a fine time to grade things and the answer turns out to be you rescale it if

1080
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:18,260
you want to go from log base 2 of something to log base 10 of something it

1081
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,860
involves rescaling and one way you could think about this is with the change of

1082
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:29,100
base formula so let's say we have now let's get rid of our E stuff let's say

1083
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:36,460
you have log base 2 of X but we want to write it in terms of log base 10 we can

1084
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:44,580
write that as log base 10 of X divided by log base 10 of 2 saying how many

1085
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:48,220
times does 2 go into X in a multiplicative sense is the same as

1086
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:52,300
saying how many times does the log of 2 go into the log of X in an additive sense

1087
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:59,900
okay and well what is 1 divided by the log base 10 of 2 so we're going to keep

1088
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:06,780
our log base 10 of X out here and from what we found earlier we found that log

1089
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:13,260
base 10 of 2 was approximately 3 tenths was approximately 0.3 so when we divide

1090
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:18,660
by it that should get us 10 thirds okay and this lines up with what we were

1091
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,180
looking at a little bit earlier with powers of 1000 let's see where was it

1092
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:29,160
where was it great so when we're converting from log base 10 of something

1093
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:33,460
up to log base 2 you know here we were thinking of multiplying the top by 0.3

1094
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,460
to get to the bottom but you could also think of multiplying by 10 thirds to get

1095
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:40,740
to the top anytime you have log base 10 of some number you just rescale it and

1096
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:45,220
you have log base 2 of that number and the rescaling constant comes from the

1097
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:50,820
log base 2 of 10 or vice versa log base 10 of 2 so that's change of base like I

1098
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,660
said it's very important it lets you put everything into a nice universal

1099
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:58,100
language and that should be all of the hint that you need for the last question

1100
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:01,380
which is a challenge question on this one so if anyone's been watching and

1101
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:07,860
they've been like I know logarithms I've got this completely down let me pull up

1102
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,420
the last question which came up on let's see it's not the AMC but it's what

1103
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:16,140
whatever the predecessor to the AMC was I believe so it's you know it's gonna

1104
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:20,780
involve a little cleverness and manipulation we've got this long

1105
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:25,740
sequence of fractions okay you take 1 divided by the log base 2 of a hundred

1106
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:31,220
factorial and remember 100 factorial is 100 times 99 times 98 on the way all the

1107
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:36,420
way down to 1 so 1 divided by the log base 2 of that plus 1 divided by the log

1108
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:42,220
base 3 of 100 factorial plus 1 divided by log base 4 of 100 factorial on and on

1109
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:48,380
and on up until 1 divided by the log base 100 of 100 factorial so this looks

1110
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:53,700
rather intimidating right certainly adding fractions is never fun adding a

1111
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,620
hundred fractions seems even worse dealing with a bunch of logs of different

1112
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:02,420
bases seems like a pain and the factorial is playing into this so I'm

1113
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:06,660
just gonna give you you know given that this is the wind down time I'm gonna

1114
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:11,140
give you two or three minutes to start thinking about this and if you don't get

1115
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:15,340
it it's totally fine we're gonna walk through what the answer is but I'm just

1116
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:19,300
gonna let people think about this final challenge question before we call it a

1117
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,420
day

1118
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,480
you

1119
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:04,480
you

1120
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,480
you

1121
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:04,480
you

1122
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,480
you

1123
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:44,980
so I'm gonna give you a little bit more time on this one because it's definitely

1124
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:50,060
it's definitely fun to work out and I think if you know how to start then

1125
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:53,700
great but if you don't know how to start just letting yourself kind of work with

1126
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:58,940
a couple of the different rules that we've worked out before change of base

1127
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,980
comes into play if you'd like to use that and just kind of keep manipulating

1128
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:06,660
and if it feels like you're getting something that's a little too messy see

1129
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:12,460
if you come at it from a different angle and because answers are rolling in a

1130
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:16,940
little bit more slowly now what I'm gonna do is just start to describe the

1131
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:22,660
explanation here and then come back to grade it in just a moment here so the

1132
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:27,260
expression that we have looks like I just started writing it out while you

1133
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:32,540
guys were working on it 1 divided by log base 2 of 100 factorial plus 1

1134
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:36,220
divided by log base 3 of 100 factorial and before you even start the fact that

1135
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:39,900
the thing on the inside of the log involves a big product of stuff should

1136
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,100
actually feel good because logs like to take in things that look like products

1137
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:47,580
because of the most important property that we have which is the idea that it

1138
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:52,300
turns products into addition okay so right away you know that you're probably

1139
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,740
going to use that second thing you notice is that it's uncomfortable to

1140
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:58,740
have all of these different bases log base 2 of something log base 3 of

1141
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:02,700
something log base 100 of something so translating it all into the common

1142
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:07,060
language should be helpful how does change of base work well asking how many

1143
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:11,220
times does to go into a hundred factorial is the same as asking how many

1144
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:16,020
times does the log of 2 divide into the log of a hundred factorial it doesn't

1145
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:19,500
even matter what logarithm you use this log could be base 10 base e base 2

1146
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,700
doesn't matter this change of base formula still holds now what that means

1147
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:28,620
for our expression is instead of taking 1 divided by log base 2 of 100 factorial

1148
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:36,660
I could write that as log of 2 divided by so let me draw a little dividing line

1149
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:42,700
between what I'm doing here log of 2 divided by log of a hundred factorial

1150
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:53,620
okay and then similarly log of 3 divided by log of 100 factorial so all I'm doing

1151
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:58,660
here is taking the reciprocal so instead of taking log of 100 factorial

1152
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:02,540
over log of 2 I've inverted it log of 2 over 100 factorial because that's what

1153
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:06,860
this reciprocal is doing so with that as the beginning I'm going to go ahead and

1154
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:14,220
just grade this lock in the answers and see how see how everyone's doing so it

1155
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:22,260
looks like awesome around 1796 we always we always draw a little bit north of

1156
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:27,540
Ramanujan's number around 1800 of you answered that it's one which is correct

1157
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:33,460
congratulations 70 of you answered 100 which we can maybe see where where that

1158
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:36,940
our error would have come from those of you that answered zero that's

1159
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:41,740
interesting it would imply that somehow you have cancellation at play because

1160
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:45,100
these are all positive numbers so thinking one of them was negative so you

1161
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,580
could probably gut check against the idea that it would be zero 41 of you

1162
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:53,100
want me to come up with a number fun numerical fact about 69 but I won't 28

1163
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:59,100
of you said 2 and I think yeah I think that's I think the the difference

1164
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,620
between 1 and 100 maybe would be interesting to try to analyze but if we

1165
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:06,420
go back to our answer I realize it may be a little bit confusing how I've written

1166
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,100
this this isn't this is not a big fraction this was just a dividing line

1167
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:16,860
between not ironically trying not to confuse my fractions with each other so

1168
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:22,700
rewriting our expression up on the top here as we add all of these things and

1169
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:34,420
we can continue up until log of 100 all divided by log of 100 factorial the key

1170
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:39,740
is that now all of the denominators are the same so we can add the numerators no

1171
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:43,820
more plus sign is just going to equal something that top is going to look like

1172
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:58,420
log of 2 plus log of 3 plus on and on up to log of 100 all divided by the log of

1173
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:02,780
100 factorial and it seems like the only little contention among those answering

1174
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:06,540
the question is whether this should simplify to be 1 or should it simplify

1175
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:12,180
to be a hundred and really the way we can think about this is to just break

1176
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:16,860
down that bottom part in terms of what a factorial means I'll go ahead and do

1177
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:20,220
this on the bottom part since I didn't manage my paper real estate very

1178
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:30,020
effectively here the log of 100 times 99 times 98 on and on times 2 times 1 is

1179
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:35,020
the same as adding all of them and you can probably see this mostly cancels out

1180
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:38,540
with the top the only question you might have though is that in the factorial

1181
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:43,860
and we keep multiplying down until we get that one which doesn't really make

1182
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:48,420
a difference but before you think about it too much you might wonder hang on you

1183
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:51,980
know on the bottom I'm multiplying everything and I'm adding this log of 1

1184
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,900
but on the top from what we found before I never saw that log of 1 does that make

1185
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:00,820
any difference and the answer is no because log of 1 is saying 10 to the

1186
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:06,540
power of what equals 1 and the answer is 0 so in fact taking the log of 100

1187
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:10,460
factorial is the same as adding the logs of all the numbers from 2 up to 100 and

1188
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:15,180
it simplifies down to 1 so to those of you who got it congratulations to those

1189
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:18,620
of you who feel like you maybe have better intuitions for change of base

1190
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:22,500
formulas for the fact that logarithms turn multiplication into addition that's

1191
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,500
my hope in the next time with this as a foundation of logarithms that can be

1192
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,900
pointed back to what I would love to talk about is what's known as the

1193
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:34,220
natural logarithm log base e and try to give an instinct for why that's

1194
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,020
something that we care about okay why is it that mathematicians just seem to

1195
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:41,540
really love the number e sitting in the base of their logarithms what does that

1196
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:46,220
buy for them why does it show up in nature so that will happen on Friday at

1197
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:51,580
the same time as this lecture and I look forward to seeing everyone there

1198
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,280
you
