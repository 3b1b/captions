  "input": "and we see this sitting around early March or so and of course this is because this is when the corona outbreak was really starting to kick into high gear and everyone wanted to understand exponential growth and a common way that exponential growth is plotted is with what's known as a logarithmic scale so I actually made a video about this and in it I was creating some animations and wanted to illustrate this idea of exponential growth and the main idea here, I'll go ahead and skip back to a different animation is if you're tracking the numbers, in this case this was the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 outside of mainland China in the months leading up to March you could just track what the absolute number is but the pattern that you'll find is that as you go from one day to the next, you tend to be increasing multiplicatively it's a little bit like earlier, we were seeing the powers of 10 one step to the next, you're multiplying by some amount the way that the virus was growing was very similar from one day to the next, you're multiplying not quite by a constant but in this case, for this sequence of days, it was around 1.2 in that region, you're multiplying by something so when you're plotting this, it ends up looking like this classic exponential curve that curves upward and I can sometimes make it hard to see where it's going or what the overall pattern is so a common trick is to say, instead of looking at this y-axis that increases linearly as in here I'm going from 5k to 10k, 10k to 15k, 15k to 20k each step is additive, we're adding 5,000 instead use a y-axis where each step is multiplicative so you're going from 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10, 10,000 all of these are increases by multiplying by 10 and what you can say is the y-axis is now plotting not the total number of cases but the logarithm of the total number of cases and this actually makes it kind of easier to see on a plot if you wanted to project out what that trend would do and it's a little bit of a naive model to say, oh it's going to grow exactly exponentially but in the early phases of something like this, that is what it is so I kind of fast-forward in the animation I made for that video and what's interesting is if back then, I think I posted it on March 6th if you just found a line of best fit and you stretched it out and you said, when is that line going to cross a million?

  "input": "which because the y-axis is growing with multiplicative steps each time that you step up, you're multiplying by 10 so even if it might seem like the 20,000 cases or so that it was back then is very far from a million you know, when you understand logarithmic scales, it actually didn't seem that far it was only 30 days away if you naively just drew out that line and in fact, fast-forward to around April 5th, which is when that would have predicted we hit a million cases outside China that's pretty much the day that it happened I think plus or minus a day, I don't remember exactly but it was right in that neighborhood because I remember thinking wow it was kind of a naive model for the video to even use and it's shocking that it matched so exactly thankfully, since then, the growth has stopped being exponential so if you look at it on a logarithmic plot, instead of going up in a straight line, it starts to taper off but, point being, any time that you're coming across something in nature or even in a man-made construct where what's natural to think about are multiplicative increases logarithms come in to help you so let's go ahead and think about what these actually are how are they defined, okay?

  "input": "that is such a fantastic question, Max and I think it comes down to the fact that with addition and multiplication you're not, I'll just draw it out for you actually this is going to be easiest if we have some kind of exponential relationship let's say 10 to the power 3 is equal to 1000 there's three different numbers at play here showing a relationship between the 10, the 3, and the 1000 and aside from writing it with an exponent there's two other ways we could write that same relationship we could also say that the cube root of 1000 is equal to 10 this is asking 1000, what number raised to the third is equal to 1000 that's sort of what the cube root is asking and another way that you could phrase the exact same thing is to say the log base 10 of 1000 is equal to 3 three different notations, the same exact relationship a while ago I made this video about an alternate possible notation that would center in the idea that you think of this relationship between the three numbers with a triangle where you'd have our 10 sitting down here the power sitting at the top, 10 to the third and the thing they equal sitting to the lower right and whenever you want to talk about a function or an operation between two of these numbers you indicate which one of them you're leaving out so to write 10 cubed, we would include the 10 on the lower left the 3 on the upper right, and then we leave out that bottom one so this is indicating that we're taking a power, 10 cubed for that radical, what you would say is we know what's on the bottom right something to some power equals 1000 we even know what the power is something cubed equals that 1000 but the thing we don't know is on the bottom left that is the sense in which radicals are an opposite of exponentiation where if the thing you don't know instead of being on that bottom right is on the bottom left but what logarithms are, it's an inverse in another sense because what it's saying is, in this triangle relationship we know the base, it's 10 we know the power that it should be, 1000 but the thing we don't know is what's in that exponent so to answer your question maybe even more briefly we could say that 10 to the x, the inverse of that the inverse is the log base 10 you know, of y, of some other variable whereas if you're taking x to the 10th, some unknown raised to a power the inverse of that is going to be the 10th root of some other value and on the triangle it's basically asking which of the things do we consider to be a variable so are you considering that lower right to be a variable quantity are you considering that top to be a variable quantity and what is the unknown but I really liked this idea of making explicit how we have three totally different notations for the same exact fact one of them you're using relative positions of the numbers one of them we introduce a new symbol, this radical and one of them we introduce a new word, log so these three syntactically different ways to communicate the same idea seemed wrong and so I made this video about an alternate possible notation and while I don't necessarily think that we should teach logarithms with this triangle because convention is what it is so it's better to start getting people used to the usual expression what I do like about it and starting off with it is when you see and think about this triangle it's really emphasizing that what the log wants to be is that exponent every time that you see log of some value you should think in your mind, okay, whatever this number is it really wants to be an exponent it wants to be an exponent and we'll see more of what that means as we go on okay, so every time you see a log it wants to be an exponent this value three and more specifically it should be an exponent sitting on top of whatever that base is now in terms of convention for the first part of this video I'm just going to be using log without a base written on it to be the shorthand for log base 10 because log base 10 will be the most intuitive thing out there you should know that often in math the convention instead is that log without anything might mean log base e there's also another notation for that ln for natural log we're going to talk all about the natural log next time so don't worry too much about that right now and there's also yet another convention often if you're in a computer science setting log without any added sugar to indicate what it is defaults to meaning log base 2 so this can sometimes be a source of confusion but it basically depends on what discipline you're in in math, not moth, math people really like a base of e, we'll see why next lecture in, I don't know, I'll say engineering but really it's anything where you want good intuition with our normal base 10 number system log means log base 10 and if you're curious, often in computer science settings log base 2 comes up all the time so, like I said, in the back of your mind if you're trying to think of some of these properties just resting on the idea that log counts the number of zeros at the end of a number that can get you a really far way so we're going to start going through a couple of these properties and I want to do this just with a set of practiced examples so we'll transition away from the pole and this time to the first proper question and the question asks you which

  "translatedText": "それはとても素晴らしい質問ですね、マックス、結 局のところ、足し算と掛け算はそうではないという 事実に帰着すると思います。私があなたのためにそ れを描いてみましょう。実際、ある種の指数関数 があれば、これが最も簡単になります関係性として 、10 の 3 乗が 1000 に等しいとしま す。ここでは、10、3、および 1000 の 間の関係を示す 3 つの異なる数字が使用されて います。指数で書く以外に、同じ関係を書く方法が 他に 2 つあります。また、1000 の立方 根は 10 に等しいとも言えます。これは 10 00 を求めています。3 乗した数が 1000 に等しいのは、立方根が求めていることのよう なものです。まったく同じことを別の言い方で表現 すると、次のようになります。1000 の対数 底 10 が 3 に等しいと言うには、3 つの 異なる表記法、まったく同じ関係が少し前にあり ました。私は、この 3 つの数値間の関係を 3 つの数値間の関係について考えるというアイデア を中心とした別の可能な表記法についてこのビデ オを作成しました。三角形の場合、ここに 10 を配置し、その累乗を一番上に配置し、10 から 3 番目の累乗を右下に配置します。これらの 数字の 2 つの間の関数や演算について話したい ときはいつでも、そのうちのどれを省略するかを示 します。つまり、10 の 3 乗を書くには、 左下の 10 と右上の 3 を含めます。そして 、一番下の 1 を省略します。これは、べき乗、 その部首の 10 の 3 乗、あなたが言うのは 、右下にあるものはわかっています、何かの 3 乗が 1000 に等しいこと、その 3 乗が 1000 に等しいことが何であるかさえ私たち は知っています、しかし私たちが知らないのは下 にあるということです左は、根号がべき乗の反対で あるという意味です。右下ではなく左下にあるもの の、対数が何であるかわからないものがある場合 、それは別の意味で逆になります。この三角関係で は、底はわかっています。10 であるべきべき乗 はわかっています。1000 ですが、その指数 に何が含まれているかはわかりません。したがって 、あなたの質問に答えるには、もっと簡潔に、10 は次のように言えます。x、その逆数は、他の 変数の y の 10 を底とする対数です。一 方、x を 10 乗すると、未知の値の逆数が次 のようになります。他の値の 10 乗根、そして 三角形では、基本的にどれが変数であると考える かを尋ねています。つまり、右下は変数量であると 考えていますか、上部は変数量であると考えていま すか、そしてその不明ですが、まったく同じ事実 に対してまったく異なる 3 つの表記法があるこ とを明示するこのアイデアがとても気に入りました 。そのうちの 1 つは数値の相対位置を使用し ています。そのうちの 1 つは新しい記号、この 部首を導入し、そのうちの 1 つは私たちが使用 しています。新しい単語 log を導入しました 。そのため、同じ考えを伝えるためのこれら 3 つの構文的に異なる方法は間違っているように思 えたので、別の可能な表記法についてこのビデオを 作成しました。ただし、この三角形を使って対数 を教える必要があるとは必ずしも思いません。慣例 が重要であるためです。そのため、人々に通常の表 現に慣れてもらうことから始めたほうが良いと思 います。私がこの表現について気に入っている点は 、この三角形を見て考えると、ログが望んでいるの はその指数であることが毎回強調されることです 。何らかの値の対数が表示されます。頭の中で考え てください。この数値が何であれ、実際には指数に なりたいのです。指数になりたいのです。それが何 を意味するかは、続けていくうちにさらにわかり ます。ログを見るときは、この値 3 の指数にな りたいと考えています。具体的には、これから使用 するこのビデオの最初の部分の規則に基づいて、 その基数の上にある指数である必要があります。底 を付けない対数は、対数底 10 の略語になりま す。なぜなら、対数底 10 が最も直感的なも のになるからです。数学では、代わりに、何も付け ない対数は、対数底を意味する可能性があり、別の 底もあるということを知っておく必要があります 。自然対数の ln の表記法です。自然対数につ いては次回お話しますので、今はあまり心配しない でください。コンピュータ サイエンス設定のログ を何も使用していない場合は、さらに別の規則も あります。デフォルトが対数底2を意味することを 示すために砂糖を追加しました。そのため、これは 時々混乱の原因になる可能性がありますが、基本 的には、蛾ではなく、数学のどの分野に属している かによって決まります。数学の人は本当にeの底を 好みます、私たちは'理由は次の講義で わかります。わかりません。エンジニアリングと言 うつもりですが、実際には、通常の 10 を基数 とする数値システムの直観が必要な場合は何でも です。ログは 10 を基数とする対数を意味しま す。興味があれば、コンピューター サイエンスの 場合が多いです。設定ログのベース 2 は常に表 示されるため、前述したように、これらのプロパ ティのいくつかを考えようとしている場合は、ログ がログの末尾のゼロの数をカウントするという考え に基づいて考えてください。非常に遠くまで到達 できる数値なので、これらの特性をいくつか見てい きます。一連の実践的な例だけを使ってこれを行い たいので、極から離れて、今度は最初の適切な質 問とその質問は、次のどれが正しいかを尋ねます。",

  "input": "so the correct answer here is a, which it looks like 4,000 of you got congratulations, telling us that log of x to the power n is equal to n times log of x so, again, let's say that you're trying to teach this to someone or if you're trying to come to grips with what it means yourself I think a fine place to start is plugging something in and in this case, for log of x to the power n let's just try it with 100 to the power 3 and you could try it with other ones to see if the patterns you're doing actually work but if you're thinking it through not in terms of simply seeing what the answer is but trying to think of why the answer turned out that way sometimes one example will do because 100 cubed, we can think of that as taking well, that's 3 copies of 100 I'm taking 3 copies of 100 and when I multiply all that out and I think of log as counting the number of zeros we say, oh, it's going to be some number that just has 6 zeros on it that's what it means to take 100 times 100 times 100 I can just think of grouping all of those zeros together to get a million so this number is going to be 6 but if we think actually why was it 6 not just that's the number of zeros inside the million where that 6 came from is that we had 3 copies of that 100 and each of those 100 had 2 different zeros so that way it's a more general way you can think about it where if instead of taking 100 cubed we were looking at 1000 cubed or 1000 to the n or x to the power n you can think that it's whatever that value of n was the number of copies we were multiplying in times the number of well, let's see, it's not x times the number of zeros that were in whatever we substituted for x which in this case was 100 so if instead I had taken something like log of 10,000 to the power n this would be the same as taking n copies of that 10,000 counting the number of zeros in each one of them which is 4 so it would be n times 4 and of course the general property that most of you correctly answered is that you have this lovely little effect where when you see the log of something raised to a power that little power hops down in front of it and you just have log of what was on the inside now one of the maybe most important implications of that I don't know if you'd call it an implication or if you'd call it a restatement of the definition if I'm taking log and I'll just re-emphasize it's base 10 of 10 to the power n we can kind of think of that little n as hopping down in front and it becomes n times the log base 10 of 10 which is of course 1 this expression you can think of as either counting the number of zeros at the end or more generally it's asking 10 to the what equals 10 and the answer is simply 1 which is very reassuring because another way that you could go back and just read this original expression is saying 10 to the what equals 10 to the n oh well the answer is n ok now with every given logarithm property that we have so in this case we just found one log of x to the power n involves that n hopping in front there's always going to be a mirror image exponential property and that's another way that we can help to get ourselves a little bit of intuition for these so let me just cover up some of the future properties we're going to get to here try to hide where we're going what we just found raising something to the n that hops in front this corresponds to the exponential property that if I take 10 to the x and raise that whole thing to the power n that's the same as taking 10 to the n times x and this gets us to another intuition that you might have for logarithms which is they kind of they're like exponentiation turned inside out and here's what I mean by that the thing sitting on the inside of the log if I'm taking log of a you should be thinking of that as the whole outer expression for something that's exponential in this case the a the thing on the inside corresponds to 10 to the x the output of the function whereas the entire thing itself the log of a corresponds to what's on the inside over here just what's the exponent of the 10 so wherever you see a log expression here you should be thinking that plays the role of an exponent on the right side and every time you see an exponential the entire 10 to the x expression the whole outer component on the right side that corresponds to something that's sitting on the inside of one of the logs and we saw this above the idea that when we're multiplying on the inside that's adding on the outside well if logs kind of turn exponentials inside out that's telling us that multiplying on the outside multiplying the outputs of the function is the same as adding on the inside because each of these logs like log a and log b is playing the role of the x and the y in the expression on the right so with that let's keep playing let's just do a couple more of these and see how many of these properties that we can build up an intuition for so this last one, very nice thinking of exponents hopping down the next one is something that might look a little bit weird to those who are not necessarily familiar with logarithms but again, plug in some numbers to gain some intuition for it and we'll give it a little bit more a moment to pull up which of the following is true?

  "translatedText": "ここでの正解は a です。4,000 人がお祝いの言葉を受け取ったようです 。x の n 乗の対数は x の対数の n 倍に等しいと教えてもらいました 。それで、もう一度、これを教えようとし ているとしましょう。誰かに伝えるか、 あるいは自分自身でその意味を理解しよう としているなら、何かを接続することか ら始めるのが良いと思います。この場合 、x の n 乗の対数について、100 の乗で試してみましょう。3 そし て、他のパターンで試して、やっているパ ターンが実際に機能するかどうかを確認 することもできますが、単純に答えを見る という観点からではなく、なぜ答えがそ のようになったのかを考えようとする場合 は、場合によっては 1 つの例で十分 です。なぜなら、100 の 3 乗は 十分に得られると考えることができます。それは 100 の 3 つのコピーで す。私は 100 の 3 つのコピーを 取り、それをすべて掛け算すると、lo g はゼロの数を数えると考えることがで きます。言ってください、ああ、それは ゼロが 6 つある数字になるでしょう 、つまり 100 かける 100 かけ る 100 を意味します これらのゼ ロをすべてグループ化して 100 万を 得ることが考えられるので、この数字は 次のようになりますしかし、実際に考えて みると、なぜ 6 だったのかというと 、100 万の中のゼロの数だけではなく 、その 6 の由来は、その 100 のコピーが 3 つあり、それらの 1 00 のそれぞれに 2 つの異なるゼロ があるため、より一般的になります。100 の 3 乗の代わりに 1000 の 3 乗、または 1000 の n 乗または x の n 乗を調べた場 合、n の値は何倍にもなるコピー数で あると考えることができます。の数は、 x に代入したゼロの数の x 倍ではあ りません。この場合は 100 なので 、代わりに 10,000 の n 乗の ようなものを計算しても、これは同じに なります。その 10,000 個のコピ ーを n 枚取り、それぞれの 0 の 数を数えると 4 になるので、n の 4 倍になります。そしてもちろん、ほ とんどの人が正しく答えた一般的な特性 は、この素敵な小さな効果があるというこ とです。何かがその前でわずかな力で飛 び降りるまで上昇したログを見てください 。そうすれば、内側に何があったのかの ログが得られます。それがおそらく最も重 要な意味の1つです。それをそう呼んで いいのかわかりませんが、含意、あるい は定義の言い換えと呼ぶなら、もし私がロ グをとっていて、それが 10 の底 10 の n 乗であることをもう一度強 調しておきますが、その小さな n は 、ある種の中でホップダウンしていると考 えることができます。この式は、末尾の ゼロの数を数えているか、より一般的には 10 に等しいものを 10 と求め ており、答えは単純に 1 ですこれは 非常に安心できます。なぜなら、戻ってこ の元の式を読むこともできる別の方法は 、10 と n が 10 に等しいと言 っているからです。まあ、答えは、与え られたすべての対数特性で OK です。この場合、次のようになります。x の n 乗の対数を 1 つ見つけまし た。n が前にホッピングすることを意味 します。常に鏡像の指数特性が存在しま す。これは、これらについて少し直感的に 理解するのに役立つもう 1 つの方法 です。ここにたどり着く予定の将来のプロ パティのいくつかは、どこに行くのかを 隠そうとします。今見つけたものを前にホ ップする n に何かを上げます。これ は、x に 10 を加えて上げた場合 の指数特性に対応します。この全体の n 乗は、10 の n 倍 x と同じ です。そして、これにより、対数に対して 抱くかもしれない別の直観が得られます 。対数は、べき乗を裏返しにしたようなも のです。これが私が言いたいことです。ログの内側にあるものは、a のログを 取得する場合、それを指数関数的な何かの 外側の式全体として考える必要がありま す。この場合、a 内側にあるものは 1 0 から x に対応します。関数の出 力自体は、a の対数全体が内部にあるも のに対応しており、10 の指数に相当 するため、ここで対数式が表示される場合 は、それが右側の指数の役割を果たして いると考える必要があります。指数関数 を見るたびに、10 から x までの式 全体が右側の外側の要素全体になります 。これは、ログの 1 つの内側にあるも のに対応します。これは、乗算するとき のアイデアの上で見られました。内側では 外側で足し算をしているので、ログが指 数関数的に裏返しになっている場合は、 外側で乗算して関数の出力を乗算すること は、内側で足し算するのと同じであるこ とがわかります。なぜなら、これらのログ はそれぞれ log a と log b のようになっているからです。は右側 の式の x と y の役割を果たして いるので、これで遊びを続けましょう。こ れらをさらにいくつか実行して、直感を 構築できるこれらのプロパティの数を確 認しましょう。それでは、これが最後のも のです。指数が次の指数に飛び降りると いう非常に素晴らしい考え方は、対数に必 ずしも慣れていない人にとっては少し奇 妙に見えるかもしれませんが、もう一度、 いくつかの数値を入力して直観を得るこ とができます。次のどれが真実ですか?

  "input": "but as we get even more intense into this 5 and 6 range which were well above the atom bomb scale now we're only merely at around 2 per day and I'm sure that a geologist could come in and explain why we all shouldn't be super worried about the fact that there's two atom bomb equivalent disruptions to the earth's crust happening every day but presumably it's particularly rare for those to be concentrated on some spot like a city where lots of people live now just verifying our thought that each step involves a growth of 32 let's look at what the step from 6 up to 7 looks like and here it's giving us lots more examples in between maybe giving the illusion that that's a bigger step than it actually is and indeed that's the difference between 1 megaton and 32 megatons so that's multiplying by 32 one of the things I found most interesting on this chart by the way was look at how far we have to go before we get to the largest nuclear weapon that's ever actually been tested this was height of the cold war the Tsar bomb that was 50 megatons and I believe they actually had original plans to have a 100 megaton bomb but talked themselves down from that 50 megatons, we're talking start off at that 32 kilotons of the Nagasaki bomb multiply by 32 to get a megaton multiply by another 32 so we're talking about a thousand times the strength of the World War II ending explosion and you're still not at the 50 megatons of what humanity is capable of and that is evidently the Java earthquake of Indonesia so 7.0 is not just a little bit bigger than 6.0, it's a lot bigger and the point here of course is just that when you have a scale giving you multiplicative increases it's worth appreciating that what look like small steps can actually be huge steps in terms of the energy implied or the absolute values implied here so when we're thinking about the fact that there was ever a 9.5 that actually seems absurd given that it's only in the 7.0 range that we're talking about the largest thermonuclear weapon ever put out and this is indicative of one area where logarithms tend to come about it's when humans want to create a scale for something that accounts for a hugely wide variance in how big things can be so in the case of size of earthquakes you can have things from what happens just all the time around the Earth, the size of a large hand grenade and you want that to be on your scale and something to think about ranging all the way up to the largest disruption that we've seen in human history and in order to have that in a way that you're not just writing a whole bunch of different digits in your numbers for one case and a whole bunch of different, a smaller number of digits for your number in another case it's nice to take logarithms and then just put that on a single scale that basically squishes those numbers between 0 and 10 you see something very similar going on with the decibel scale for music that one actually works a little bit differently where every time you take a step up of 10 decibels that corresponds to multiplying by 10 so rather than a step of 1 multiplying by 10, it's a step of 10 that multiplies by 10 so that kind of makes the math of it a little bit screwy but the idea is the same, that if you're listening to a sound that's 50 decibels versus 60 decibels it's a lot quieter in terms of the energy being transmitted and going from, what would it be, 60 to 70 or 70 to 80 those steps, from 60 up to 80, that involves multiplying the amount of energy per square area by a factor of 100 so every time you see a logarithmic scale, know in your mind that that means whatever it's referring to under the hood grows by a huge amount this is again why we saw a lot of logarithmic scales used to describe the coronavirus outbreak so how might you describe a relationship like this where every time you grow the Richter scale number by 1, you're multiplying by 32 well, we could think in terms of a log with base 32 I could say if I take the log of, I'm just going to call r, the number for the Richter scale I might think of this as log base 32 and that's going to correspond to, no no no, I'm doing this wrong that's not the thing that's logged we take the log base 32 of the big number, of the TMT number, something that was like 1 megaton it's 1 million tons the log base 32, that should correspond to the Richter scale number but there might be some kind of offset, so we might say that there's some kind of constant s that we're adding to this Richter scale number and this expression is exactly the same, excuse me for going off the bottom there this expression is exactly the same as saying 32 to the power of some offset times our Richter scale number which is the same as taking 32 to that offset, which itself is just some big constant, times 32 to the Richter scale number so you might think of this as just being some constant times 32 to the power of the number you see so this way of writing it really emphasizes the exponential growth of it that if this is what corresponds to the TMT amount that you see, as you increase that r step by step you're multiplying by 32 but another way of communicating the exact same fact is to take the log base 32 of whatever that amount is alright now the next thing I want to talk about is how we don't always have to worry about how to compute logs of different bases it's a little weird here that we were talking about log base 32, I referenced earlier how mathematicians really like to have a log with base e computer scientists really like to have a log with base 2 and it turns out for computational purposes or for also thinking about how these things grow if you have one log, if you're able to compute one type of log, whether that's base 10, base 2, base e you can compute pretty much anything else that you want now to get our intuitions in that direction, let's turn back to our quiz and go to the next question and I believe that this question is the most, I don't know, this is a halfway reasonable question, this should be nice this is just going to get us prepared to translate from base 2 context to base 10 context and it's also a good intuition for understanding powers of 2 to have in general the relationship that it has with powers of 10 because it's this lovely kind of coincidence of nature that these two sort of well you'll see what I mean, they play nicely with each other so our question asks, given the fact that 2 to the 10th is 1024, 1024, which is approximately 1000 so if you're being a little bit loose with your numbers and you're just making approximations 2 to the 10th, basically 1000, which of the following is closest to being true?
