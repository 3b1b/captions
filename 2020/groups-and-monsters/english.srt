00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Today, many members of the YouTube math community are getting together to make videos about

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,860
their favorite numbers over 1 million, and we're encouraging you, the viewers, to do

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,980
the same.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,240
Take a look at the description for details.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,240
My own choice is considerably larger than a million, roughly 8x10 to the 53.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,120
For a sense of scale, that's around the number of atoms in the planet Jupiter, so

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,400
it might seem completely arbitrary.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,920
But what I love is that if you were to talk with an alien civilization or a super-intelligent

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,920
AI that invented math for itself without any connection to our particular culture or experiences,

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,880
I think both would agree that this number is something very peculiar and that it reflects

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,720
something fundamental.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
What is it, exactly?

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,640
Well, it's the size of the monster, but to explain what that means we're going to

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
need to back up and talk about group theory.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,820
This field is all about codifying the idea of symmetry.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,380
For example, when we say a face is symmetric, what we mean is that you can reflect it about

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,420
a line and it's left looking completely the same.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,660
It's a statement about an action that you can take.

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,140
Something like a snowflake is also symmetric, but in more ways.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,940
You can rotate it 60 degrees or 120 degrees, you can flip it along various different axes,

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,940
and all these actions leave it looking the same.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,300
A collection of all of the actions like this taken together is called a group.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,900
Kind of, at least, groups are typically defined a little more abstractly than this, but we'll

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
get to that later.

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,100
Take note, the fact that mathematicians have co-opted such an otherwise generic word for

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,360
this seemingly specific kind of collection should give you some sense of how fundamental

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,180
they find it.

28
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,620
Also take note, we always consider the action of doing nothing to be part of the group.

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,220
So if we include that do-nothing action, the group of symmetries of a snowflake includes

30
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,140
12 distinct actions.

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,580
It even has a fancy name, D6.

32
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,300
The simple group of symmetries that only has two elements acting on a face also has a fancy

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,540
name, C2.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,020
In general, there is a whole zoo of groups with no shortage of jargon to their names

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,620
categorizing the many different ways that something can be symmetric.

36
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,760
When we describe these sorts of actions, there's always an implicit structure being preserved.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,980
For example, there are 24 rotations that I can apply to a cube that leave it looking

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,600
the same, and those 24 actions taken together do indeed constitute a group.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,800
But if we allow for reflections, which is a kind of way of saying that the orientation

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,180
of the cube is not part of the structure we intend to preserve, you get a bigger group,

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,600
with 48 actions in total.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,720
If you loosen things further and consider the faces to be a little less rigidly attached,

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,100
maybe free to rotate and get shuffled around, you would get a much larger set of actions.

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,480
And yes, you could consider these symmetries in the sense that they leave it looking the

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,120
same, and all of these shuffling-rotating actions do constitute a group, but it's

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,340
a much bigger and more complicated group.

47
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,280
The large size in this group reflects the much looser sense of structure which each

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
action preserves.

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,060
The loosest sense of structure is if we have a collection of points and we consider any

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,200
way you could shuffle them, any permutation, to be a symmetry of those points.

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,700
Unconstrained by any underlying property that needs to be preserved, these permutation groups

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
can get quite large.

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,500
Here, it's kind of fun to flash through every possible permutation of six objects

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:41,460
and see how many there are.

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,520
In total, it amounts to 6! or 720.

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,320
By contrast, if we gave these points some structure, maybe making them the corners of

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,320
a hexagon and only considering the permutations that preserve how far apart each one is from

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,020
the other, we only get the 12 snowflake symmetries we saw earlier.

59
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,640
Bump the number of points up to 12, and the number of permutations grows to about 479

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,800
million.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,560
The monster that we'll get to is rather large, but it's important to understand

62
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,620
that largeness in and of itself is not that interesting when it comes to groups.

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,580
The permutation groups already make that easy to see.

64
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,140
If we were shuffling 101 objects, for example, with the 101 factorial different actions that

65
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,060
can do this, we have a group with a size of around 9x10-159.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,580
If every atom in the observable universe had a copy of that universe inside itself, this

67
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,240
is roughly how many sub-atoms there would be.

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,020
These permutation groups go by the name S-sub-n, and they play a very important role in group

69
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
theory.

70
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,620
In a certain sense, they encompass all other groups.

71
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,660
And so far, you might be thinking, okay, this is intellectually playful enough, but is any

72
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,620
of this actually useful?

73
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,340
One of the earliest applications of group theory came when mathematicians realized that

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,320
the structure of these permutation groups tells us something about solutions to polynomial

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
equations.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,680
We know how, in order to find the two roots of a quadratic equation, everyone learns a

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,060
certain formula in school.

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,180
Slightly lesser known is the fact that there's also a cubic formula, one that involves nesting

79
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,900
cube roots with square roots in a larger expression.

80
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,340
There's even a quartic formula for a degree 4 polynomial, which is an absolute mess.

81
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,640
It's almost impossible to write without factoring things out.

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,180
And for the longest time, mathematicians struggled to find a formula to solve degree 5 polynomials.

83
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,000
Maybe there's one, but it's just super complicated.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,840
It turns out, though, if you think about the group which permutes the roots of such a polynomial,

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,840
there's something about the nature of this group that reveals no quintic formula can

86
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
exist.

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,640
For example, the five roots of the polynomial you see on screen now have definite values,

88
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,080
you could write out decimal approximations, but what you can never do is write those exact

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,760
values by starting with the coefficients of the polynomial and using only the four basic

90
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,840
operations of arithmetic together with radicals, no matter how many times you nest them.

91
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,360
And that impossibility has everything to do with the inner structure of the permutation

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
group S5.

93
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,800
A theme in math through the last two centuries has been that the nature of symmetry in and

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,560
of itself can show us all sorts of non-obvious facts about the other objects that we study.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,460
To give just a hint of the many many ways that this applies to physics, there's a

96
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,380
beautiful fact known as Noether's theorem saying that every conservation law corresponds

97
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,420
to some kind of symmetry, a certain group.

98
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,860
So all those fundamental laws like conservation of momentum and conservation of energy each

99
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,860
correspond to a group.

100
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,900
More specifically, the actions we should be able to apply to a setup such that the laws

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,180
of physics don't change.

102
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,980
All of this is to say that groups really are fundamental, and the one thing I want you

103
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,380
to recognize right now is that they are one of the most natural things that you could

104
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,420
study.

105
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,860
What could be more universal than symmetry?

106
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,220
So you might think that the patterns among groups themselves would somehow be very beautiful

107
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,620
and symmetric.

108
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,380
The monster, however, tells a different story.

109
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,640
Before we get to the monster, though, at this point some mathematicians might complain that

110
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,920
what I've described so far are not groups exactly, but group actions, and that groups

111
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,280
are something slightly more abstract.

112
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,940
By way of analogy, if I mention the number 3, you probably don't think about a specific

113
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,500
triplet of things.

114
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,420
You probably think about 3 as an object in and of itself, an abstraction, maybe represented

115
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,780
with a symbol.

116
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,700
In much the same way, when mathematicians discuss the elements of a group, they don't

117
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,120
necessarily think about specific actions on specific objects, they might think of these

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,180
elements as a kind of thing in and of itself, maybe represented with a symbol.

119
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,260
For something like the number 3, the abstract symbol does us very little good unless we

120
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,140
define its relation with other numbers, for example the way it adds or multiplies with

121
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,300
them.

122
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,340
For each of these, you could think of a literal triplet of something, but again, most of us

123
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,980
are comfortable, probably even more comfortable, using the symbols alone.

124
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,780
Similarly, what makes a group a group are all of the ways that its elements combine

125
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
with each other.

126
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,300
And in the context of actions, this has a very vivid meaning.

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,660
What we mean by combining is to apply one action after the other, read from right to

128
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
left.

129
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,520
If you flip a snowflake about the x-axis, then rotate it 60 degrees counterclockwise,

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:32,060
the overall action is the same as if you had flipped it about a diagonal line.

131
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,380
All possible ways that you can combine two elements of a group like this defines a kind

132
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,180
of multiplication.

133
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,240
That is what really gives a group its structure.

134
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,360
Here I'm drawing out the full 8x8 table of the symmetries of a square.

135
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,920
If you apply an action from the top row and follow it by an action from the left column,

136
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:59,040
it'll be the same as the action in the corresponding grid square.

137
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,680
But if we replace each one of these symmetric actions with something purely symbolic, well

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,140
the multiplication table still captures the inner structure of the group, but now it's

139
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,220
abstracted away from any specific object that it might act on, like a square or roots

140
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,960
of a polynomial.

141
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,740
This is entirely analogous to how the usual multiplication table is written symbolically,

142
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,400
which abstracts away from the idea of literal counts.

143
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,740
Literal counts, arguably, would make it much clearer what's going on, but since grade

144
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,560
school we all grow comfortable with the symbols.

145
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,740
After all, they're less cumbersome, they free us to think about more complicated numbers,

146
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,900
and they also free us to think about numbers in new and very different ways.

147
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,480
All of this is true of groups as well, which are best understood as abstractions above

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,060
the idea of symmetry actions.

149
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm emphasizing this for two reasons.

150
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,940
One is that understanding what groups really are gives a better appreciation for the monster,

151
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,900
and the other is that many students learning about groups for the first time can find them

152
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,380
frustratingly opaque.

153
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,860
I know that I did.

154
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,720
A typical course starts with this very formal and abstract definition, which is that a group

155
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,180
is a set, any collection of things, with a binary operation, a notion of multiplication

156
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,060
between those things, such that this multiplication satisfies four special rules, or axioms.

157
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,100
And all of this can feel, well, kind of random, especially when it isn't made clear that

158
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,640
all of these axioms arise from the things that must obviously be true when you're

159
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,520
thinking about actions and composing them.

160
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,440
To any students among you with such a course in the future, I would say if you appreciate

161
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,800
that the relationship groups have with symmetric actions is analogous to the relationship

162
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,500
numbers have with counts, it can help to make the course a lot more grounded.

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,940
An example might help to see why this kind of abstraction is desirable.

164
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,640
Consider the symmetries of a cube and the permutation group of four objects.

165
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
At first, these groups feel very different.

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,640
You might think of the one on the left as acting on eight corners in a way that preserves

167
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,720
the distance and orientation structure among them.

168
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,640
But on the right, we have a completely unconstrained set of actions on a much smaller set of points.

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,120
As it happens though, these two groups are really the same, in the sense that their multiplication

170
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,440
tables will look identical.

171
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,720
Anything that you can say about one group will be true of the other.

172
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,800
For example, there are eight distinct permutations where applying it three times in a row gets

173
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,240
you back to where you started, not counting the identity.

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,400
These are the ones that cycle three different elements together.

175
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,080
There are also eight rotations of the cube that have this property, the various 120 and

176
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,520
240 degree rotations about each diagonal.

177
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,720
This is no coincidence.

178
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,660
The way to phrase this more precisely is to say there is a one-to-one mapping between

179
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,480
rotations of a cube and permutations of four elements which preserves composition.

180
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,680
For example, rotating 180 degrees about the y-axis followed by 180 degrees about the x-axis

181
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,640
gives the same overall effect as rotating 180 degrees around the z-axis.

182
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,880
Remember, that's what we mean by a product of two actions.

183
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
And if you look at the corresponding permutations under a certain one-to-one association, this

184
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,260
product will still be true.

185
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,760
Applying the two actions on the left gives the same overall effect as the one on the

186
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,640
right.

187
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,880
When you have a correspondence where this remains true for all products, it's called

188
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,820
an isomorphism, which is maybe the most important idea in group theory.

189
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,740
This particular isomorphism, between cube rotations and permutations of four objects,

190
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,500
is a bit subtle, but for the curious among you, you may enjoy taking a moment to think

191
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:44,800
hard about how the rotations of a cube permute its four diagonals.

192
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,840
In your mathematical life, you'll see more examples of a given group arising from seemingly

193
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,920
unrelated situations, and as you do, you'll get a better sense for what group theory is

194
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,380
all about.

195
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,420
Think about how a number like 3 is not really about a particular triplet of things, it's

196
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,260
about all possible triplets of things.

197
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,380
In the same way, a group is not really about symmetries of a particular object, it's

198
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,160
an abstract way that things can even be symmetric.

199
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,580
There are even plenty of situations where groups come up in a way that does not feel

200
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,760
like a set of symmetric actions at all, just as numbers can do a lot more than count.

201
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,280
In fact, seeing the same group come up in different situations is a great way to reveal

202
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,720
unexpected connections between distinct objects.

203
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
That's a very common theme in modern math.

204
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,900
And once you understand this about groups, it leads you to a natural question, which

205
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,280
will eventually lead to the monster.

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,960
What are all the groups?

207
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,860
But now you're in a position to ask that question in a more sophisticated way.

208
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,600
What are all the groups up to isomorphism?

209
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,760
Which is to say, we consider two groups to be the same if there's an isomorphism between

210
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,840
them.

211
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,320
This is asking something more fundamental than what are all the symmetric things.

212
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,040
It's a way of asking what are all the ways that something can be symmetric?

213
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,960
Is there some formula or procedure for producing them all, some meta-pattern lying at the heart

214
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,320
of symmetry itself?

215
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,760
This question turns out to be hard, exceedingly hard.

216
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,640
For one thing, there's the division between infinite groups, for example the ones describing

217
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,040
the symmetries of a line or a circle, and finite groups, like the ones we've looked

218
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,660
at up to this point.

219
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,080
To maintain some hope of sanity, let's limit our view to finite groups.

220
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,680
In the same way that numbers can be broken down into their prime factorization, or molecules

221
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
can be described based on the atoms within them, there's a certain way that finite

222
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,160
groups can be broken down into a kind of composition of smaller groups.

223
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,760
The ones which can't be broken down any further, analogous to prime numbers or atoms,

224
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,260
are known as the simple groups.

225
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,000
To give a hint for why this is useful, remember how we said that group theory can be used

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,720
to prove that there's no formula for a degree 5 polynomial, the way there is for

227
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,760
quadratic equations?

228
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,600
If you're wondering what that proof actually looks like, it involves showing that if there

229
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,920
were some kind of mythical quintic formula, something which uses only radicals and the

230
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,120
basic arithmetic operations, it would imply that the permutation group on five elements

231
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,320
decomposes into a special kind of simple group, known fancifully as the cyclic groups of prime

232
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,580
order.

233
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,020
But the actual way that this breaks down involves a different kind of simple group, a different

234
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:25,020
kind of atom, one which polynomial solutions built from radicals would never allow.

235
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,340
That is a super high-level description of course, with about a semester's worth of

236
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,580
details missing, but the point is that you have this really not obvious fact about a

237
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,260
different part of math whose solutions come from finding the atomic structure of a certain

238
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
group.

239
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,060
This is one of many different examples where understanding the nature of these simple groups,

240
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,880
these atoms, actually matters outside of group theory.

241
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,140
The task of categorizing all finite groups breaks down into two steps.

242
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,040
One, find all the simple groups, and two, find all of the ways to combine them.

243
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,980
The first question is like finding the periodic table, and the second is a bit like doing

244
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,340
all of chemistry thereafter.

245
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,700
The good news is that mathematicians have found all of the finite simple groups.

246
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,580
Well, more pertinent is that they proved that the ones they found are, in fact, all the

247
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,160
ones out there.

248
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,880
It took many decades, tens of thousands of dense pages of advanced math, hundreds of

249
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,700
some of the smartest minds out there, and significant help from computers.

250
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,380
But by 2004, with a culminating 12,000 pages to tie up the loose ends, there was a definitive

251
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
answer.

252
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,980
Many experts agree, this is one of the most monumental achievements in the history of

253
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,300
math.

254
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,560
The bad news, though, is that the answer is absurd.

255
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,160
There are 18 distinct infinite families of simple groups, which makes it really tempting

256
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,000
to lean into the whole periodic table analogy.

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,440
But groups are stranger than chemistry, because there are also these 26 simple groups that

258
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560
are just left over, they don't fit the other patterns.

259
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,480
These 26 are known as the sporadic groups.

260
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,240
That a field of study rooted in symmetry itself has such a patched together fundamental structure

261
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,560
is, well I mean it's just bizarre.

262
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,240
It's like the universe was designed by committee.

263
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,040
If you're wondering what we mean by an infinite family, examples might help.

264
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,960
One such family of simple groups includes all of these cyclic groups with prime order.

265
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,500
These are essentially the symmetries of a regular polygon with a prime number of sides,

266
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,740
but where you're not allowed to flip the polygon over.

267
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,620
Another of these infinite families is very similar to the permutation groups we saw earlier,

268
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,780
but there's the tiniest constraint on how they're allowed to shuffle n items.

269
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,160
If they act on 5 or more elements, these groups are simple.

270
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,220
Which incidentally is heavily related to why polynomials with degree 5 or more have solutions

271
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,160
that can't be written down using radicals.

272
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,520
The other 16 families are notably more complicated, and I'm told that there's at least a little

273
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,180
ambiguity in how to organize them into cleanly distinct families without overlap, but what

274
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,800
everybody agrees on is that the 26 sporadic groups stand out as something very different.

275
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,820
The largest of these sporadic groups is known, thanks to John Conway, as the monster group,

276
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,880
and its size is the number I mentioned at the start.

277
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,220
The second largest, and I promise this isn't a joke, is known as the baby monster group.

278
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,580
Together with the baby monster, 19 of these sporadic groups are in a certain sense children

279
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,080
of the monster, and Robert Greece called these 20 the happy family.

280
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,700
He also called the other six, which don't even fit that pattern, the pariahs.

281
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,780
As if to compensate for how complicated the underlying math here is, the experts really

282
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,680
let loose on their whimsy while naming things.

283
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,040
Let me emphasize, having a group which is big is not that big a deal, but the idea that

284
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,300
one of the fundamental building blocks for one of the most fundamental ideas in math

285
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,660
comes in a collection that just abruptly stops around 8x10 to the 53, that's weird.

286
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,400
Now at this point, given that I introduced groups as symmetries, a collection of actions,

287
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,560
we might wonder what it is that the monster acts on.

288
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,040
What object does it describe the symmetries of?

289
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,040
There is an answer, but it doesn't fit into two or three dimensions to draw, nor does

290
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
it fit into four or five.

291
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,960
Instead, to see what the monster acts on, we would have to jump up to...wait for it...

292
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,360
196,883 dimensions.

293
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:22,440
Just describing one of the elements of this group takes about 4 GB of data, even though

294
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,760
plenty of groups that are way bigger have a much smaller computational description.

295
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,680
The permutation group on 101 elements was, if you'll recall, dramatically bigger, but

296
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,240
we can describe each one of its elements with very little data, for example a list of 100

297
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,800
numbers.

298
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,320
No one really understands why the sporadic groups, and the monster in particular, are

299
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,500
there.

300
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,240
Maybe in a few decades there will be a clearer answer, maybe one of you will come up with

301
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
it, but despite knowing that they are deeply fundamental to math, and arguably to physics

302
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,120
as well, a lot about them remains mysterious.

303
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,380
In the 1970s, mathematician John McKay was making a switch from studying group theory

304
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:11,280
to an adjacent field, and he noticed that a number very similar to this 196,883 showed

305
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
up in a completely unrelated context, or at least almost.

306
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,760
A number one bigger than this was in the series expansion of a fundamental function in a totally

307
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,120
different part of math, relevant to these things called modular forms and elliptic functions.

308
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,000
Assuming this was more than a coincidence seemed crazy, enough that it was playfully

309
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
deemed moonshine by John Conway.

310
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,540
But after more numerical coincidences like this were noticed, it gave rise to what became

311
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,680
known as the monstrous moonshine conjecture, whimsical names just don't stop.

312
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,680
This was proved by Richard Borcherds in 1992, solidifying a connection between very different

313
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,080
parts of math that at first glance seemed crazy.

314
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,040
Six years later, by the way, he won the Fields Medal, in part for the significance of this proof.

315
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,160
And related to this moonshine is a connection between the monster and string theory.

316
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,680
Maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise that something that arises from symmetry itself

317
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,420
is relevant to physics, but in light of just how random the monster seems at first glance,

318
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,860
this connection still elicits a double take.

319
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,840
To me, the monster and its absurd size is a nice reminder that fundamental objects are

320
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,860
not necessarily simple.
