00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,600
Today, many members of the YouTube math community are getting together to make videos about

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,980
their favorite numbers over 1 million, and we're encouraging you, the viewers, to do

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,440
the same.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,560
Take a look at the description for details.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,440
My own choice is considerably larger than a million, roughly 8x10 to the 53.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,180
For a sense of scale, that's around the number of atoms in the planet Jupiter, so

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,720
it might seem completely arbitrary.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,900
But what I love is that if you were to talk with an alien civilization or a super-intelligent

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,420
AI that invented math for itself without any connection to our particular culture or experiences,

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,860
I think both would agree that this number is something very peculiar and that it reflects

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,780
something fundamental.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,580
What is it, exactly?

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,680
Well, it's the size of the monster, but to explain what that means we're going to

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,880
need to back up and talk about group theory.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,880
This field is all about codifying the idea of symmetry.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,420
For example, when we say a face is symmetric, what we mean is that you can reflect it about

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,840
a line and it's left looking completely the same.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
It's a statement about an action that you can take.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,760
Something like a snowflake is also symmetric, but in more ways.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,340
You can rotate it 60 degrees or 120 degrees, you can flip it along various different axes,

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,180
and all these actions leave it looking the same.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,480
A collection of all the actions like this taken together is called a group.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,900
Kind of, at least.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,180
Groups are typically defined a little more abstractly than this, but we'll get to that

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,560
later.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,180
Take note, the fact that mathematicians have co-opted such an otherwise generic word for

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,300
this seemingly specific kind of collection should give you some sense of how fundamental

28
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,120
they find it.

29
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,000
Also take note, we always consider the action of doing nothing to be part of the group.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,200
So if we include that do-nothing action, the group of symmetries of a snowflake includes

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,460
12 distinct actions.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,220
It even has a fancy name, D6.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,140
The simple group of symmetries that only has two elements acting on a face also has a fancy

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,480
name, C2.

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,760
In general, there is a whole zoo of groups with no shortage of jargon to their names

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,420
categorizing the many different ways that something can be symmetric.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,080
When we describe these sorts of actions, there's always an implicit structure being preserved.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,980
For example, there are 24 rotations that I can apply to a cube that leave it looking

39
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,840
the same, and those 24 actions taken together do indeed constitute a group.

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,580
But if we allow for reflections, which is a kind of way of saying that the orientation

41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,820
of the cube is not part of the structure we intend to preserve, you get a bigger group,

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,600
with 48 actions in total.

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,380
If you loosen things further and consider the faces to be a little less rigidly attached,

44
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,200
maybe free to rotate and get shuffled around, you would get a much larger set of actions.

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,580
And yes, you could consider these symmetries in the sense that they leave it looking the

46
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,120
same, and all of these shuffling rotating actions do constitute a group, but it's

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,020
a much bigger and more complicated group.

48
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,360
The large size in this group reflects the much looser sense of structure which each

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,320
action preserves.

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,140
The loosest sense of structure is if we have a collection of points and we consider any

51
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,340
way you could shuffle them, any permutation, to be a symmetry of those points.

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,680
Unconstrained by any underlying property that needs to be preserved, these permutation groups

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,720
can get quite large.

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,180
Here, it's kind of fun to flash through every possible permutation of six objects

55
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,660
and see how many there are.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,640
In total, it amounts to 6! or 720.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
By contrast, if we gave these points some structure, maybe making them the corners of

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,340
a hexagon and only considering the permutations that preserve how far apart each one is from

59
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,540
the other, well then we only get the 12 snowflake symmetries we saw earlier.

60
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,780
Bump the number of points up to 12, and the number of permutations grows to about 479 million.

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,200
The monster we'll get to is rather large, but it's important to understand that largeness

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
in and of itself is not that interesting when it comes to groups.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,840
The permutation groups already make that easy to see.

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,200
If we were shuffling 101 objects, for example, with the 101 factorial different actions that

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,120
can do this, we have a group with a size of around 9x10 to the 159.

66
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,640
If every atom in the observable universe had a copy of that universe inside itself, this

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,060
is roughly how many sub-atoms there would be.

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,040
These permutation groups go by the name S-sub-n, and they play a very important role in group

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,340
theory.

70
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,600
In a certain sense, they encompass all other groups.

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,700
And so far you might be thinking, okay, this is intellectually playful enough, but is any

72
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,720
of this actually useful?

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,400
One of the earliest applications of group theory came when mathematicians realized that

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,880
the structure of these permutation groups tells us something about solutions to polynomial

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,460
equations.

76
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,780
You know how, in order to find the two roots of a quadratic equation, everyone learns a

77
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,000
certain formula in school?

78
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,220
Slightly lesser known is the fact that there's also a cubic formula, one that involves nesting

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,560
cube roots with square roots in a larger expression.

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,100
There's even a quartic formula for a degree 4 polynomial, which is an absolute mess.

81
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,980
It's almost impossible to write without factoring things out.

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,260
And for the longest time, mathematicians struggled to find a formula to solve degree 5 polynomials.

83
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,980
Maybe there's one, but it's just super complicated.

84
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,600
It turns out, though, if you think about the group which permutes the roots of such a polynomial,

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,740
there's something about the nature of this group that reveals no quintic formula can

86
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,220
exist.

87
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,500
For example, the five roots of the polynomial you see on screen now have definite values,

88
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,100
you could write out decimal approximations, but what you can never do is write those exact

89
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,800
values by starting with the coefficients of the polynomial and using only the four basic

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,180
operations of arithmetic together with radicals, no matter how many times you nest them.

91
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,340
And that impossibility has everything to do with the inner structure of the permutation

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,460
group S5.

93
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,840
A theme in math through the last two centuries has been that the nature of symmetry in and

94
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,800
of itself can show us all sorts of non-obvious facts about the other objects that we study.

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,560
To give just a hint of the many many ways that this applies to physics, there's a

96
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,280
beautiful fact known as Noether's theorem saying that every conservation law corresponds

97
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,660
to some kind of symmetry, a certain group.

98
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,980
So all those fundamental laws like conservation of momentum and conservation of energy each

99
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,160
correspond to a group.

100
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,980
More specifically, the actions we should be able to apply to a setup such that the laws

101
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,120
of physics don't change.

102
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,040
All of this is to say that groups really are fundamental, and the one thing I want you

103
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,480
to recognize right now is that they are one of the most natural things that you could

104
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,820
study.

105
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,980
What could be more universal than symmetry?

106
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,220
So you might think that the patterns among groups themselves would somehow be very beautiful

107
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,920
and symmetric.

108
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,560
The monster, however, tells a different story.

109
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
Before we get to the monster, though, at this point some mathematicians might complain that

110
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,840
what I've described so far are not groups exactly, but group actions, and that groups

111
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,380
are something slightly more abstract.

112
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,960
By way of analogy, if I mention the number 3, you probably don't think about a specific

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,900
triplet of things.

114
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,380
You probably think about 3 as an object in and of itself, an abstraction, maybe represented

115
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,040
with a symbol.

116
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,740
In much the same way, when mathematicians discuss the elements of a group, they don't

117
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,200
necessarily think about specific actions on specific objects, they might think of these

118
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,100
elements as a kind of thing in and of itself, maybe represented with a symbol.

119
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,380
For something like the number 3, the abstract symbol does us very little good unless we

120
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,200
define its relation with other numbers, for example the way it adds or multiplies with

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,560
them.

122
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,380
For each of these, you could think of a literal triplet of something, but again, most of us

123
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,340
are comfortable, probably even more comfortable, using the symbols alone.

124
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,780
Similarly, what makes a group a group are all of the ways that its elements combine

125
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,620
with each other.

126
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,780
And in the context of actions, this has a very vivid meaning.

127
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,620
What we mean by combining is to apply one action after the other, read from right to

128
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:17,960
left.

129
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,080
If you flip a snowflake about the x-axis, then rotate it 60 degrees counterclockwise,

130
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,660
the overall action is the same as if you had flipped it about a diagonal line.

131
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,440
All possible ways that you can combine two elements of a group like this defines a kind

132
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,160
of multiplication.

133
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,140
That is what really gives a group its structure.

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,720
Here, I'm drawing out the full 8x8 table of the symmetries of a square.

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,380
If you apply an action from the top row and follow it by an action from the left column,

136
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,020
it'll be the same as the action in the corresponding grid square.

137
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,760
But if we replace each one of these symmetric actions with something purely symbolic, well,

138
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,280
the multiplication table still captures the inner structure of the group, but now it's

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,260
abstracted away from any specific object that it might act on, like a square or roots

140
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,080
of a polynomial.

141
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,440
This is entirely analogous to how the usual multiplication table is written symbolically,

142
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,460
which abstracts away from the idea of literal counts.

143
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,800
Literal counts, arguably, would make it much clearer what's going on, but since grade

144
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
school we all grow comfortable with the symbols.

145
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,300
After all, they're less cumbersome, they free us to think about more complicated numbers,

146
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,880
and they also free us to think about numbers in new and very different ways.

147
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,480
All of this is true of groups as well, which are best understood as abstractions above

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,260
the idea of symmetry actions.

149
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm emphasizing this for two reasons.

150
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,320
One is that understanding what groups really are gives a better appreciation for the monster,

151
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,760
and the other is that many students learning about groups for the first time can find them

152
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
frustratingly opaque.

153
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,140
I know that I did.

154
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,640
A typical course starts with this very formal and abstract definition, which is that a group

155
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,120
is a set in a collection of things, with a binary operation, a notion of multiplication

156
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,160
between those things, such that this multiplication satisfies four special rules, or axioms.

157
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,060
And all of this can feel, well, kind of random, especially when it isn't made clear that

158
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,600
all of these axioms arise from the things that must obviously be true when you're

159
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,680
thinking about actions and composing them.

160
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,420
To any students among you with such a course in the future, I would say if you appreciate

161
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,300
that the relationship groups have with symmetric actions is analogous to the relationship numbers

162
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,460
have with counts, it can help to make the course a lot more grounded.

163
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,920
An example might help to see why this kind of abstraction is desirable.

164
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,980
Consider the symmetries of a cube and the permutation group of four objects.

165
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,900
At first, these groups feel very different.

166
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,620
You might think of the one on the left as acting on eight corners in a way that preserves

167
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
the distance and orientation structure among them.

168
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,640
But on the right, we have a completely unconstrained set of actions on a much smaller set of points.

169
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,100
As it happens, though, these two groups are really the same, in the sense that their multiplication

170
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,520
tables will look identical.

171
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,940
Anything that you can say about one group will be true of the other.

172
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,880
For example, there are eight distinct permutations where applying it three times in a row gets

173
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,380
you back to where you started, not counting the identity.

174
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,740
These are the ones that cycle three different elements together.

175
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,700
There are also eight rotations of the cube that have this property, the various 120 and

176
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,420
240 degree rotations about each diagonal.

177
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,600
This is no coincidence.

178
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,660
The way to phrase this more precisely is to say there is a one-to-one mapping between

179
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,680
rotations of a cube and permutations of four elements, which preserves composition.

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,260
For example, rotating 180 degrees about the y-axis followed by 180 degrees about the x-axis

181
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,180
gives the same overall effect as rotating 180 degrees around the z-axis.

182
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Remember, that's what we mean by a product of two actions.

183
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,220
And if you look at the corresponding permutations under a certain one-to-one association, this

184
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,500
product will still be true.

185
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,920
Applying the two actions on the left gives the same overall effect as the one on the

186
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,120
right.

187
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,940
When you have a correspondence where this remains true for all products, it's called

188
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,800
an isomorphism, which is maybe the most important idea in group theory.

189
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,120
This particular isomorphism between cube rotations and permutations of four objects is a bit

190
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,260
subtle, but for the curious among you, you may enjoy taking a moment to think hard about

191
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,480
how the rotations of a cube permute its four diagonals.

192
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,860
In your mathematical life, you'll see more examples of a given group arising from seemingly

193
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,020
unrelated situations, and as you do, you'll get a better sense for what group theory is

194
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,540
all about.

195
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,520
Think about how a number like 3 is not really about a particular triplet of things, it's

196
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
about all possible triplets of things.

197
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,380
In the same way, a group is not really about symmetries of a particular object, it's

198
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,220
an abstract way that things can even be symmetric.

199
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,660
There are even plenty of situations where groups come up in a way that does not feel

200
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,820
like a set of symmetric actions at all, just as numbers can do a lot more than count.

201
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,200
In fact, seeing the same group come up in different situations is a great way to reveal

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,280
unexpected connections between distinct objects, that's a very common theme in modern math.

203
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
And once you understand this about groups, it leads you to a natural question, which

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
will eventually lead to the monster.

205
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
What are all the groups?

206
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,280
But now you're in a position to ask that question in a more sophisticated way.

207
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,000
What are all the groups up to isomorphism?

208
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,220
Which is to say, we consider two groups to be the same if there's an isomorphism between them.

209
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,280
This is asking something more fundamental than what are all the symmetric things.

210
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,580
It's a way of asking, what are all the ways that something can be symmetric?

211
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,940
Is there some formula or procedure for producing them all, some meta-pattern lying at the heart

212
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,080
of symmetry itself?

213
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,980
This question turns out to be hard, exceedingly hard.

214
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,660
For one thing, there's the division between infinite groups, for example the ones describing

215
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,080
the symmetries of a line or a circle, and finite groups, like the ones we've looked

216
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,960
at up to this point.

217
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,920
To maintain some hope of sanity, let's limit our view to finite groups.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,600
In the same way that numbers can be broken down into their prime factorization, or molecules

219
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,720
can be described based on the atoms within them, there's a certain way that finite

220
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,500
groups can be broken down into a kind of composition of smaller groups.

221
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,280
The ones which can't be broken down any further, analogous to prime numbers or atoms,

222
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,300
are known as the simple groups.

223
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,020
To give a hint for why this is useful, remember how we said that group theory can be used

224
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,220
to prove that there's no formula for a degree 5 polynomial the way there is for quadratic

225
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,800
equations?

226
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,120
Well, if you're wondering what that proof actually looks like, it involves showing that

227
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,580
if there were some kind of mythical quintic formula, something which uses only radicals

228
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,780
and the basic arithmetic operations, it would imply that the permutation group on 5 elements

229
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,360
decomposes into a special kind of simple group, known fancifully as the cyclic groups of prime

230
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,740
order.

231
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,020
But the actual way that this breaks down involves a different kind of simple group, a different

232
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,560
kind of atom, one which polynomial solutions built from radicals would never allow.

233
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,420
That is a super high-level description of course, with about a semester's worth of

234
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,560
details missing, but the point is that you have this really not obvious fact about a

235
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,040
different part of math whose solutions come from finding the atomic structure of a certain

236
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,360
group.

237
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,720
This is one of many different examples where understanding the nature of these simple groups,

238
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,840
these atoms, actually matters outside of group theory.

239
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,660
The task of categorizing all finite groups breaks down into two steps.

240
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,340
One, find all the simple groups, and two, find all of the ways to combine them.

241
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,980
The first question is like finding the periodic table, and the second is a bit like doing

242
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,340
all of chemistry thereafter.

243
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,200
The good news is that mathematicians have found all of the finite simple groups.

244
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,640
Well, more pertinent is that they proved that the ones they found are, in fact, all the

245
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,420
ones out there.

246
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,940
It took many decades, tens of thousands of dense pages of advanced math, hundreds of

247
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,060
some of the smartest minds out there, and significant help from computers.

248
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,000
But by 2004, with a culminating 12,000 pages to tie up the loose ends, there was a definitive

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,500
answer.

250
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,100
Many experts agree, this is one of the most monumental achievements in the history of

251
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,420
math.

252
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,900
The bad news, though, is that the answer is absurd.

253
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,120
There are 18 distinct infinite families of simple groups, which makes it really tempting

254
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,340
to lean into the whole periodic table analogy.

255
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,440
But groups are stranger than chemistry, because there are also these 26 simple groups that

256
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,820
are just left over, they don't fit the other patterns.

257
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,780
These 26 are known as the sporadic groups.

258
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,300
That a field of study rooted in symmetry itself has such a patched together fundamental structure

259
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,860
is, well I mean it's just bizarre.

260
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,360
It's like the universe was designed by committee.

261
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,440
If you're wondering what we mean by an infinite family, examples might help.

262
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,220
One such family of simple groups includes all of these cyclic groups with prime order.

263
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,000
These are essentially the symmetries of a regular polygon with a prime number of sides,

264
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,600
but where you're not allowed to flip the polygon over.

265
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,260
Another of these infinite families is very similar to the permutation groups we saw earlier,

266
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,160
but there's the tiniest constraint on how they're allowed to shuffle n items.

267
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,900
If they act on 5 or more elements, these groups are simple.

268
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,160
Which incidentally is heavily related to why polynomials with degree 5 or more have solutions

269
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
that can't be written down using radicals.

270
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,600
The other 16 families are notably more complicated, and I'm told that there's at least a little

271
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,260
ambiguity in how to organize them into cleanly distinct families without overlap,

272
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,960
but what everybody agrees on is that the 26 sporadic groups stand out as something very different.

273
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,300
The largest of these sporadic groups is known, thanks to John Conway, as the monster group,

274
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,040
and its size is the number I mentioned at the start.

275
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,120
The second largest, and I promise this isn't a joke, is known as the baby monster group.

276
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,880
Together with the baby monster, 19 of these sporadic groups are in a certain sense

277
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,380
children of the monster, and Robert Gries called these 20 the happy family.

278
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,940
He also called the other six, which don't even fit that pattern, the pariahs.

279
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,840
As if to compensate for how complicated the underlying math here is,

280
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,720
the experts really let loose on their whimsy while naming things.

281
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,920
Let me emphasize, having a group which is big is not that big a deal,

282
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,920
but the idea that one of the fundamental building blocks for one of the most fundamental ideas in math

283
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,680
comes in a collection that just abruptly stops around 8x10 to the 53.

284
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,120
That's weird.

285
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,920
Now, at this point, given that I introduced groups as symmetries, a collection of actions,

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,980
you might wonder what it is that the monster acts on.

287
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,060
What object does it describe the symmetries of?

288
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,280
Well, there is an answer, but it doesn't fit into two or three dimensions to draw,

289
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
nor does it fit into four or five.

290
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,120
Instead, to see what the monster acts on, we would have to jump up to...

291
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,520
Wait for it...

292
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
196,883 dimensions.

293
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,560
Just describing one of the elements of this group takes about 4 GB of data,

294
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,080
even though plenty of groups that are way bigger have a much smaller computational description.

295
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,100
The permutation group on 101 elements was, if you'll recall, dramatically bigger,

296
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,400
but we can describe each one of its elements with very little data, for example a list of 100 numbers.

297
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,880
Why the Sporadic Groups?

298
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,560
No one really understands why the sporadic groups, and the monster in particular, are there.

299
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,560
Maybe in a few decades there will be a clearer answer, maybe one of you will come up with it,

300
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,420
but despite knowing that they are deeply fundamental to math,

301
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,100
and arguably to physics as well, a lot about them remains mysterious.

302
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,280
In the 1970s, mathematician John McKay was making a switch from studying group theory

303
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,180
to an adjacent field, and he noticed that a number very similar to this 196,883

304
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,500
showed up in a completely unrelated context, or at least almost.

305
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,880
A number one bigger than this was in the series expansion of a fundamental function

306
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,360
in a totally different part of math, relevant to these things called modular forms and elliptic functions.

307
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,680
Assuming that this was more than a coincidence seemed crazy,

308
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,860
enough that it was playfully deemed moonshine by John Conway.

309
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,160
But after more numerical coincidences like this were noticed,

310
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,580
it gave rise to what became known as the monstrous moonshine conjecture.

311
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,640
Whimsical names just don't stop.

312
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,280
This was proved by Richard Borcherds in 1992,

313
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,140
solidifying a connection between very different parts of math that at first glance seemed crazy.

314
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,280
Six years later, by the way, he won the Fields Medal, in part for the significance of this proof.

315
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,540
And related to this moonshine is a connection between the monster and string theory.

316
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,520
Maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise that something that arises from symmetry itself

317
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,940
is relevant to physics, but in light of just how random the monster seems at first glance,

318
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,140
this connection still elicits a double take.

319
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,540
To me, the monster and its absurd size is a nice reminder that fundamental objects

320
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,760
are not necessarily simple. The universe doesn't really care if its final answers look clean.
