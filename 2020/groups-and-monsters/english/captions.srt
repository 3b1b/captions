00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,359
Today, many members of the YouTube math community are getting 

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,743
together to make videos about their favorite numbers over 1 million, 

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:13,440
and we're encouraging you, the viewers, to do the same.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,560
Take a look at the description for details.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,440
My own choice is considerably larger than a million, roughly 8x10 to the 53.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,894
For a sense of scale, that's around the number of atoms in the planet Jupiter, 

7
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,720
so it might seem completely arbitrary.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,072
But what I love is that if you were to talk with an alien civilization or a 

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:35,026
super-intelligent AI that invented math for itself without any connection to 

10
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,826
our particular culture or experiences, I think both would agree that this 

11
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:42,780
number is something very peculiar and that it reflects something fundamental.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,580
What is it, exactly?

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,856
Well, it's the size of the monster, but to explain what that 

14
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:50,880
means we're going to need to back up and talk about group theory.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,880
This field is all about codifying the idea of symmetry.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,878
For example, when we say a face is symmetric, what we mean is that you 

17
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,840
can reflect it about a line and it's left looking completely the same.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
It's a statement about an action that you can take.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,760
Something like a snowflake is also symmetric, but in more ways.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,932
You can rotate it 60 degrees or 120 degrees, you can flip it along 

21
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:20,180
various different axes, and all these actions leave it looking the same.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,480
A collection of all the actions like this taken together is called a group.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,900
Kind of, at least.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,524
Groups are typically defined a little more abstractly than this, 

25
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:30,560
but we'll get to that later.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,609
Take note, the fact that mathematicians have co-opted such an 

27
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:37,587
otherwise generic word for this seemingly specific kind of 

28
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:41,120
collection should give you some sense of how fundamental they find it.

29
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,000
Also take note, we always consider the action of doing nothing to be part of the group.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
So if we include that do-nothing action, the group of 

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,460
symmetries of a snowflake includes 12 distinct actions.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,220
It even has a fancy name, D6.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,401
The simple group of symmetries that only has two 

34
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:02,480
elements acting on a face also has a fancy name, C2.

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,504
In general, there is a whole zoo of groups with no shortage of jargon to their 

36
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:11,420
names categorizing the many different ways that something can be symmetric.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,705
When we describe these sorts of actions, there's 

38
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,080
always an implicit structure being preserved.

39
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,119
For example, there are 24 rotations that I can apply to a cube that leave it 

40
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:26,840
looking the same, and those 24 actions taken together do indeed constitute a group.

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,752
But if we allow for reflections, which is a kind of way of saying 

42
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:35,096
that the orientation of the cube is not part of the structure we intend to preserve, 

43
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,600
you get a bigger group, with 48 actions in total.

44
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,715
If you loosen things further and consider the faces to be a little less rigidly attached, 

45
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:47,200
maybe free to rotate and get shuffled around, you would get a much larger set of actions.

46
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,146
And yes, you could consider these symmetries in the sense that they 

47
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:54,535
leave it looking the same, and all of these shuffling rotating actions 

48
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:58,020
do constitute a group, but it's a much bigger and more complicated group.

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,464
The large size in this group reflects the much 

50
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:06,320
looser sense of structure which each action preserves.

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,072
The loosest sense of structure is if we have a collection of points and we consider 

52
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:17,340
any way you could shuffle them, any permutation, to be a symmetry of those points.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,588
Unconstrained by any underlying property that needs to be preserved, 

54
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:23,720
these permutation groups can get quite large.

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,044
Here, it's kind of fun to flash through every possible 

56
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:29,660
permutation of six objects and see how many there are.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,860
In total, it amounts to 6!

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,640
or 720.

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,099
By contrast, if we gave these points some structure, 

60
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,544
maybe making them the corners of a hexagon and only considering the permutations that 

61
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:55,180
preserve how far apart each one is from the other, 

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,540
well then we only get the 12 snowflake symmetries we saw earlier.

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,126
Bump the number of points up to 12, and the number 

64
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,780
of permutations grows to about 479 million.

65
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,188
The monster we'll get to is rather large, but it's important to understand 

66
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:14,080
that largeness in and of itself is not that interesting when it comes to groups.

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,839
The permutation groups already make that easy to see.

68
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,633
If we were shuffling 101 objects, for example, 

69
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:24,542
with the 101 factorial different actions that can do this, 

70
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,120
we have a group with a size of around 9x10 to the 159.

71
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,985
If every atom in the observable universe had a copy of that universe inside itself, 

72
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:37,060
this is roughly how many sub-atoms there would be.

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,559
These permutation groups go by the name S-sub-n, 

74
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,340
and they play a very important role in group theory.

75
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,600
In a certain sense, they encompass all other groups.

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,123
And so far you might be thinking, okay, this is intellectually playful enough, 

77
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,720
but is any of this actually useful?

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,228
One of the earliest applications of group theory came when 

79
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,296
mathematicians realized that the structure of these permutation 

80
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:02,460
groups tells us something about solutions to polynomial equations.

81
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,707
You know how, in order to find the two roots of a quadratic equation, 

82
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,000
everyone learns a certain formula in school?

83
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,983
Slightly lesser known is the fact that there's also a cubic formula, 

84
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:17,560
one that involves nesting cube roots with square roots in a larger expression.

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,100
There's even a quartic formula for a degree 4 polynomial, which is an absolute mess.

86
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,980
It's almost impossible to write without factoring things out.

87
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,971
And for the longest time, mathematicians struggled 

88
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,260
to find a formula to solve degree 5 polynomials.

89
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,980
Maybe there's one, but it's just super complicated.

90
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,555
It turns out, though, if you think about the group which permutes 

91
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,806
the roots of such a polynomial, there's something about the 

92
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:45,220
nature of this group that reveals no quintic formula can exist.

93
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,525
For example, the five roots of the polynomial you see on screen now have definite values, 

94
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:54,856
you could write out decimal approximations, but what you can never do is write those 

95
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:59,390
exact values by starting with the coefficients of the polynomial and using only the four 

96
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,192
basic operations of arithmetic together with radicals, 

97
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,180
no matter how many times you nest them.

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
And that impossibility has everything to do with 

99
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,460
the inner structure of the permutation group S5.

100
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,311
A theme in math through the last two centuries has been that 

101
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,636
the nature of symmetry in and of itself can show us all sorts 

102
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:22,800
of non-obvious facts about the other objects that we study.

103
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,153
To give just a hint of the many many ways that this applies to physics, 

104
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,880
there's a beautiful fact known as Noether's theorem saying that every 

105
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,660
conservation law corresponds to some kind of symmetry, a certain group.

106
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,460
So all those fundamental laws like conservation of momentum 

107
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,160
and conservation of energy each correspond to a group.

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,564
More specifically, the actions we should be able to apply 

109
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:47,120
to a setup such that the laws of physics don't change.

110
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,628
All of this is to say that groups really are fundamental, 

111
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:54,275
and the one thing I want you to recognize right now is that they are one of the most 

112
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,820
natural things that you could study.

113
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,980
What could be more universal than symmetry?

114
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,224
So you might think that the patterns among groups 

115
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:03,920
themselves would somehow be very beautiful and symmetric.

116
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,560
The monster, however, tells a different story.

117
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,662
Before we get to the monster, though, at this point some mathematicians 

118
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,997
might complain that what I've described so far are not groups exactly, 

119
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:17,380
but group actions, and that groups are something slightly more abstract.

120
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,920
By way of analogy, if I mention the number 3, you 

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,900
probably don't think about a specific triplet of things.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,540
You probably think about 3 as an object in and of itself, 

123
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,040
an abstraction, maybe represented with a symbol.

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,404
In much the same way, when mathematicians discuss the elements of a group, 

125
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:37,990
they don't necessarily think about specific actions on specific objects, 

126
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,527
they might think of these elements as a kind of thing in and of itself, 

127
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,100
maybe represented with a symbol.

128
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,745
For something like the number 3, the abstract symbol does us very little good unless we 

129
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:53,298
define its relation with other numbers, for example the way it adds or multiplies with 

130
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:53,560
them.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,707
For each of these, you could think of a literal triplet of something, but again, 

132
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:03,340
most of us are comfortable, probably even more comfortable, using the symbols alone.

133
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,906
Similarly, what makes a group a group are all of 

134
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:09,620
the ways that its elements combine with each other.

135
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,780
And in the context of actions, this has a very vivid meaning.

136
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,960
What we mean by combining is to apply one action after the other, read from right to left.

137
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,236
If you flip a snowflake about the x-axis, then rotate it 60 degrees counterclockwise, 

138
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,660
the overall action is the same as if you had flipped it about a diagonal line.

139
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,347
All possible ways that you can combine two elements 

140
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,159
of a group like this defines a kind of multiplication.

141
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,140
That is what really gives a group its structure.

142
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,720
Here, I'm drawing out the full 8x8 table of the symmetries of a square.

143
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,770
If you apply an action from the top row and follow it by an action from the left column, 

144
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,020
it'll be the same as the action in the corresponding grid square.

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,351
But if we replace each one of these symmetric actions with something purely symbolic, 

146
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:07,752
well, the multiplication table still captures the inner structure of the group, 

147
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:11,934
but now it's abstracted away from any specific object that it might act on, 

148
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,080
like a square or roots of a polynomial.

149
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,598
This is entirely analogous to how the usual multiplication table is written symbolically, 

150
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:22,460
which abstracts away from the idea of literal counts.

151
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,666
Literal counts, arguably, would make it much clearer what's going on, 

152
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,800
but since grade school we all grow comfortable with the symbols.

153
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,437
After all, they're less cumbersome, they free us to think about more complicated numbers, 

154
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:37,880
and they also free us to think about numbers in new and very different ways.

155
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,817
All of this is true of groups as well, which are best 

156
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,260
understood as abstractions above the idea of symmetry actions.

157
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm emphasizing this for two reasons.

158
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,150
One is that understanding what groups really are gives a better 

159
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,297
appreciation for the monster, and the other is that many students 

160
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:57,920
learning about groups for the first time can find them frustratingly opaque.

161
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,140
I know that I did.

162
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,973
A typical course starts with this very formal and abstract definition, 

163
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:07,472
which is that a group is a set in a collection of things, 

164
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:11,936
with a binary operation, a notion of multiplication between those things, 

165
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:16,160
such that this multiplication satisfies four special rules, or axioms.

166
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,554
And all of this can feel, well, kind of random, 

167
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:23,536
especially when it isn't made clear that all of these axioms arise from 

168
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:27,629
the things that must obviously be true when you're thinking about actions 

169
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,680
and composing them.

170
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,215
To any students among you with such a course in the future, 

171
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:36,298
I would say if you appreciate that the relationship groups have with symmetric actions 

172
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:39,066
is analogous to the relationship numbers have with counts, 

173
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,460
it can help to make the course a lot more grounded.

174
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,920
An example might help to see why this kind of abstraction is desirable.

175
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,980
Consider the symmetries of a cube and the permutation group of four objects.

176
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,900
At first, these groups feel very different.

177
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,497
You might think of the one on the left as acting on eight corners in 

178
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:01,200
a way that preserves the distance and orientation structure among them.

179
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,130
But on the right, we have a completely unconstrained 

180
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,640
set of actions on a much smaller set of points.

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,381
As it happens, though, these two groups are really the same, 

182
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,520
in the sense that their multiplication tables will look identical.

183
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,940
Anything that you can say about one group will be true of the other.

184
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,469
For example, there are eight distinct permutations where applying it three 

185
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:26,380
times in a row gets you back to where you started, not counting the identity.

186
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,740
These are the ones that cycle three different elements together.

187
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,419
There are also eight rotations of the cube that have this property, 

188
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:39,420
the various 120 and 240 degree rotations about each diagonal.

189
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,600
This is no coincidence.

190
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,259
The way to phrase this more precisely is to say there is a one-to-one mapping between 

191
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:51,680
rotations of a cube and permutations of four elements, which preserves composition.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,683
For example, rotating 180 degrees about the y-axis followed by 180 degrees about 

193
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:03,180
the x-axis gives the same overall effect as rotating 180 degrees around the z-axis.

194
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Remember, that's what we mean by a product of two actions.

195
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,010
And if you look at the corresponding permutations under a certain one-to-one association, 

196
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,500
this product will still be true.

197
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,108
Applying the two actions on the left gives the 

198
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,120
same overall effect as the one on the right.

199
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,203
When you have a correspondence where this remains true for all products, 

200
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:26,800
it's called an isomorphism, which is maybe the most important idea in group theory.

201
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,825
This particular isomorphism between cube rotations and permutations of four 

202
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:34,835
objects is a bit subtle, but for the curious among you, 

203
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:39,028
you may enjoy taking a moment to think hard about how the rotations of a cube 

204
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,480
permute its four diagonals.

205
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,230
In your mathematical life, you'll see more examples of a given 

206
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,509
group arising from seemingly unrelated situations, and as you do, 

207
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,540
you'll get a better sense for what group theory is all about.

208
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,420
Think about how a number like 3 is not really about a particular triplet of things, 

209
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,520
it's about all possible triplets of things.

210
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,311
In the same way, a group is not really about symmetries of a particular object, 

211
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:08,220
it's an abstract way that things can even be symmetric.

212
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,790
There are even plenty of situations where groups come up in a way that does not feel 

213
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,820
like a set of symmetric actions at all, just as numbers can do a lot more than count.

214
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,430
In fact, seeing the same group come up in different situations is a great way to reveal 

215
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,041
unexpected connections between distinct objects, 

216
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,280
that's a very common theme in modern math.

217
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,674
And once you understand this about groups, it leads you to a natural question, 

218
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:33,500
which will eventually lead to the monster.

219
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
What are all the groups?

220
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,280
But now you're in a position to ask that question in a more sophisticated way.

221
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,000
What are all the groups up to isomorphism?

222
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,850
Which is to say, we consider two groups to be 

223
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,220
the same if there's an isomorphism between them.

224
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,280
This is asking something more fundamental than what are all the symmetric things.

225
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,580
It's a way of asking, what are all the ways that something can be symmetric?

226
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,963
Is there some formula or procedure for producing them all, 

227
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:04,080
some meta-pattern lying at the heart of symmetry itself?

228
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,980
This question turns out to be hard, exceedingly hard.

229
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,608
For one thing, there's the division between infinite groups, 

230
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:16,877
for example the ones describing the symmetries of a line or a circle, 

231
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,960
and finite groups, like the ones we've looked at up to this point.

232
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,920
To maintain some hope of sanity, let's limit our view to finite groups.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,048
In the same way that numbers can be broken down into their prime factorization, 

234
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,186
or molecules can be described based on the atoms within them, 

235
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:36,589
there's a certain way that finite groups can be broken down into a kind of composition 

236
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:37,500
of smaller groups.

237
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,754
The ones which can't be broken down any further, 

238
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,300
analogous to prime numbers or atoms, are known as the simple groups.

239
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,155
To give a hint for why this is useful, remember how we said that 

240
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,955
group theory can be used to prove that there's no formula for 

241
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,800
a degree 5 polynomial the way there is for quadratic equations?

242
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,792
Well, if you're wondering what that proof actually looks like, 

243
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:01,844
it involves showing that if there were some kind of mythical quintic formula, 

244
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:05,584
something which uses only radicals and the basic arithmetic operations, 

245
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:09,428
it would imply that the permutation group on 5 elements decomposes into a 

246
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:13,740
special kind of simple group, known fancifully as the cyclic groups of prime order.

247
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,751
But the actual way that this breaks down involves a different kind of simple group, 

248
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,256
a different kind of atom, one which polynomial solutions built from radicals would never 

249
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:23,560
allow.

250
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,169
That is a super high-level description of course, 

251
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:29,539
with about a semester's worth of details missing, 

252
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:33,615
but the point is that you have this really not obvious fact about a different part of 

253
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:37,360
math whose solutions come from finding the atomic structure of a certain group.

254
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,323
This is one of many different examples where understanding the nature of 

255
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:44,840
these simple groups, these atoms, actually matters outside of group theory.

256
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,660
The task of categorizing all finite groups breaks down into two steps.

257
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,340
One, find all the simple groups, and two, find all of the ways to combine them.

258
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,446
The first question is like finding the periodic table, 

259
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,340
and the second is a bit like doing all of chemistry thereafter.

260
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,200
The good news is that mathematicians have found all of the finite simple groups.

261
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,798
Well, more pertinent is that they proved that the ones they found are, 

262
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,420
in fact, all the ones out there.

263
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,743
It took many decades, tens of thousands of dense pages of advanced math, 

264
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:20,060
hundreds of some of the smartest minds out there, and significant help from computers.

265
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,747
But by 2004, with a culminating 12,000 pages to tie up the loose ends, 

266
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:26,500
there was a definitive answer.

267
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,473
Many experts agree, this is one of the most monumental 

268
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,420
achievements in the history of math.

269
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,900
The bad news, though, is that the answer is absurd.

270
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,438
There are 18 distinct infinite families of simple groups, 

271
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:43,340
which makes it really tempting to lean into the whole periodic table analogy.

272
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,336
But groups are stranger than chemistry, because there are also these 26 

273
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:50,820
simple groups that are just left over, they don't fit the other patterns.

274
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,780
These 26 are known as the sporadic groups.

275
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,097
That a field of study rooted in symmetry itself has such a patched 

276
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:01,860
together fundamental structure is, well I mean it's just bizarre.

277
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,359
It's like the universe was designed by committee.

278
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,440
If you're wondering what we mean by an infinite family, examples might help.

279
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,220
One such family of simple groups includes all of these cyclic groups with prime order.

280
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,036
These are essentially the symmetries of a regular polygon with a prime number of sides, 

281
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,599
but where you're not allowed to flip the polygon over.

282
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,617
Another of these infinite families is very similar to the permutation groups we saw 

283
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:30,160
earlier, but there's the tiniest constraint on how they're allowed to shuffle n items.

284
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,900
If they act on 5 or more elements, these groups are simple.

285
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,570
Which incidentally is heavily related to why polynomials with degree 

286
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,960
5 or more have solutions that can't be written down using radicals.

287
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,662
The other 16 families are notably more complicated, 

288
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:50,344
and I'm told that there's at least a little ambiguity in how to organize 

289
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:53,017
them into cleanly distinct families without overlap, 

290
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:56,547
but what everybody agrees on is that the 26 sporadic groups stand out 

291
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:57,960
as something very different.

292
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,247
The largest of these sporadic groups is known, thanks to John Conway, 

293
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,040
as the monster group, and its size is the number I mentioned at the start.

294
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,120
The second largest, and I promise this isn't a joke, is known as the baby monster group.

295
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,073
Together with the baby monster, 19 of these sporadic groups are in a certain 

296
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:20,380
sense children of the monster, and Robert Gries called these 20 the happy family.

297
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,940
He also called the other six, which don't even fit that pattern, the pariahs.

298
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,693
As if to compensate for how complicated the underlying math here is, 

299
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,720
the experts really let loose on their whimsy while naming things.

300
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,383
Let me emphasize, having a group which is big is not that big a deal, 

301
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:40,545
but the idea that one of the fundamental building blocks for one of the most 

302
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:44,869
fundamental ideas in math comes in a collection that just abruptly stops around 

303
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:45,680
8x10 to the 53.

304
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,120
That's weird.

305
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,004
Now, at this point, given that I introduced groups as symmetries, 

306
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:55,980
a collection of actions, you might wonder what it is that the monster acts on.

307
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,060
What object does it describe the symmetries of?

308
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,806
Well, there is an answer, but it doesn't fit into two or three dimensions to draw, 

309
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,440
nor does it fit into four or five.

310
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,120
Instead, to see what the monster acts on, we would have to jump up to...

311
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,520
Wait for it...

312
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
196,883 dimensions.

313
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,146
Just describing one of the elements of this group takes about 4 GB of data, 

314
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:25,456
even though plenty of groups that are way bigger have a much smaller computational 

315
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,080
description.

316
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,969
The permutation group on 101 elements was, if you'll recall, 

317
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:34,622
dramatically bigger, but we can describe each one of its elements with very little data, 

318
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,400
for example a list of 100 numbers.

319
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,880
Why the Sporadic Groups?

320
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,474
No one really understands why the sporadic groups, 

321
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:47,560
and the monster in particular, are there.

322
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,879
Maybe in a few decades there will be a clearer answer, 

323
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:54,409
maybe one of you will come up with it, but despite knowing that they are 

324
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,359
deeply fundamental to math, and arguably to physics as well, 

325
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,100
a lot about them remains mysterious.

326
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,656
In the 1970s, mathematician John McKay was making a switch from studying 

327
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:09,484
group theory to an adjacent field, and he noticed that a number very similar 

328
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:14,500
to this 196,883 showed up in a completely unrelated context, or at least almost.

329
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,116
A number one bigger than this was in the series expansion of a 

330
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,968
fundamental function in a totally different part of math, 

331
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,360
relevant to these things called modular forms and elliptic functions.

332
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,949
Assuming that this was more than a coincidence seemed crazy, 

333
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:30,860
enough that it was playfully deemed moonshine by John Conway.

334
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,969
But after more numerical coincidences like this were noticed, 

335
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:37,580
it gave rise to what became known as the monstrous moonshine conjecture.

336
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,640
Whimsical names just don't stop.

337
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,330
This was proved by Richard Borcherds in 1992, solidifying a connection 

338
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,140
between very different parts of math that at first glance seemed crazy.

339
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,347
Six years later, by the way, he won the Fields Medal, 

340
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,280
in part for the significance of this proof.

341
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,540
And related to this moonshine is a connection between the monster and string theory.

342
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,897
Maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise that something that arises from 

343
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:04,350
symmetry itself is relevant to physics, but in light of just how random 

344
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,140
the monster seems at first glance, this connection still elicits a double take.

345
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,016
To me, the monster and its absurd size is a nice reminder 

346
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:16,080
that fundamental objects are not necessarily simple.

347
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,760
The universe doesn't really care if its final answers look clean.

348
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,557
They are what they are by logical necessity, with no 

349
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:25,200
concern over how easily we'll be able to understand them.
