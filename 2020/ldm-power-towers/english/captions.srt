1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,900
ðŸŽµMusicðŸŽµ Presumably you can hear this.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,957
There's some construction happening in the house next door, 

3
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:17,515
and for the last hour or maybe two hours or so, 

4
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:22,310
it seems like this is the ground-smashing portion of whatever construction they're doing, 

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,254
and just the whole house has been shaking, which you will be able to hear 

6
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:27,160
if they continue.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,560
I think it's still going on now.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
So if you're curious, that's what the sound is.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,487
Now in one of the intro questions that you were just answering, 

10
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:38,232
you are actually going to have your mind primed to think about what we're going to 

11
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:39,000
talk about today.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,920
This question just made me laugh so much to write it and try to think it through.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,339
It's asking if x is the number that most people are going to enter into this box, 

14
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,920
what is 2 to the x going to be?

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,197
And it's just so mind-confuddling, because you think about, okay, 

16
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:56,121
if a lot of people are entering 1, I should enter 2, but everyone would think about that, 

17
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,693
so maybe I should enter 4, but everyone thinks about that, 

18
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,920
so I should do 2 to the 4, or maybe 2 to the that, or maybe 2 to the that.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,377
And, you know, if it was a room full of perfect logicians, you'd blow up to infinity, 

20
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:09,811
but people aren't logicians, and there is some objectively correct answer, 

21
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,520
and we can take a look at what the objectively correct answer is in this context.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,628
And it would appear most, okay, the largest number of people entered 2, 

23
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:22,180
which means anyone who entered 4 is absolutely correct.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,201
But in the game where you imagine thinking through, you know, the perfect logicians, 

25
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,597
and you're taking 2 to the 2 to the 2 to the 2, 

26
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:32,591
you're starting to think about the topic for today's video, 

27
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:35,635
which is an operation that's not typically taught in school, 

28
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:39,976
probably because it doesn't have the same level of applications as certain other ones, 

29
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:44,019
but as you'll see, there's a couple puzzles that we can start to do with it that 

30
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,262
absolutely bring out some very important problem-solving skills, 

31
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:50,656
and ideas of just really thinking through what terms actually mean, 

32
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:54,698
and whether or not operations that you're doing that seem to make sense when you 

33
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,940
do it symbolically actually make sense when you think through what's really going on.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,272
So this operation is called tetration, and a way you might think about it is, 

35
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:06,599
you know, we all learn about addition as one of the first things, 

36
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,481
the way that we can add two numbers, and multiplication, as we first see it, 

37
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,540
is repeated addition.

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,600
A times B is A plus A plus A plus A, B different times.

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,184
And if you say, well, what happens if we repeat multiplication, 

40
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:23,889
you know, taking A times A times A times A, B different times, 

41
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,360
we write it as A to the power B, and that's exponentiation.

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,977
Now if you were to go one step further in this process and say, 

43
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:34,800
what happens if we repeat exponentiation, this has a name, we call it tetration.

44
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,087
Tetra comes from the Greek for four, because it's sort of the fourth 

45
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,860
stage in this process of repeatedly applying the previous operation.

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,969
And of course, in the context of things like multiplication, 

47
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,880
we've extended the idea beyond just counting numbers.

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,357
So here this only makes sense if B was a counting number, 

49
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:56,829
but we do things like taking pi times E, or even complex values, 

50
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,980
where you can take the square root of two times one plus i.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,500
So we've extended it beyond repeated addition, but that's sort of its origin, 

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
that's the way that we often start thinking about it.

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,040
Similarly, very famously, one thing we've been talking a fair about in this 

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,520
series is extending exponentiation with the classic Euler's formula example.

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,457
But for right now, we're just going to think of this 

56
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:22,260
tetration in terms of repeating an integer number of times.

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,260
Do you hear it?

58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,257
I swear, we were so dreading the idea that the ground-smashing 

59
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:31,680
day would come during one of the streams, but here we are.

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,980
Now this is actually ambiguous if we don't define our terms a little bit more clearly, 

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,280
because exponentiation is not associative, meaning the order that we 

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,520
do these operations and start collapsing it matters.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,356
Because if I was going from left to right, let's say I was writing this as two squared, 

64
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:54,083
and then I'm going to think of squaring that, and then squaring the result, 

65
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:58,400
that will get me a different number than if I think of going from the top to the bottom.

66
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,572
If the first thing I evaluate is the two to the power two at the top, 

67
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:07,560
and then I go to the next one, and we can think about why.

68
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,804
Here if I'm collapsing from the bottom, that bottom part is four, 

69
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,780
so then I square it, and I'll square that.

70
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,000
Four squared is sixteen, so I square that, and I end up getting 256.

71
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,440
But on the bottom, if I start by collapsing that top term, it becomes a four.

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,170
And then if I think of collapsing the current top term, 

73
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,060
that becomes two to the sixteen, and that's a much bigger number.

74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,260
That is 65,536.

75
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,162
And in general, this process of repeatedly exponentiating, 

76
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:43,600
going from the top to the bottom, explodes very quickly.

77
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,152
And tetration in general refers to the top to the bottom part, 

78
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,440
so we start evaluating at the top, and we work down.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,116
If you want to make that crystal clear, I think instead of drawing it as a power tower, 

80
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:59,360
one thing that you could do is define the iterative process very exactly.

81
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:03,774
You might say we have some value that we're going to start out at one, 

82
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:08,460
and then each successive value is going to be two to the power of the previous thing.

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,980
So a sub one would just be two.

84
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,310
a sub two is going to be two to the power of whatever a sub one was, 

85
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,060
which in this case is two squared.

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,600
a sub three is going to be two to the power of whatever a sub two was, 

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
which now is two to the two to the two.

88
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,805
And there's no more ambiguity for what the order of operations should be, 

89
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:31,119
because you see that it came from the a two term, 

90
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,480
so we should first be evaluating what's in the top.

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,050
And similarly, if you go on like this, and a sub n for any value n 

92
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,007
is equal to two to the previous term, a sub n minus one, 

93
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:48,629
when you unfold this expression and kind of go back in our recursive definition, 

94
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,280
what you're going to get is a power tower of two n different times.

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,140
Now another thing that's nice about writing it like this is we can become experimental.

96
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,331
And as you all know, I love to encourage people to be very 

97
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:03,860
playful when you come across a new operation like this.

98
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,000
And a lot in this series, we've just been pulling up some Python to do that.

99
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,360
So let's do that here.

100
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,660
Let's take this iterative process and see what it actually looks like.

101
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,018
So I will go over to my terminal, I will open up some Python, 

102
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:20,552
I will set an initial value of a to be one, and then what I want to do is 

103
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:25,760
take a look at two to the power of that, but I'm going to reassign that value into a.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,180
So this double asterisk, that's how we take powers in Python.

105
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,978
And then in a lot of programming languages, a single equal sign, 

106
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:36,660
it's not a question, it's not asking if they're equal, it's an operation.

107
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,400
It's saying take whatever's sitting on that right side and shove it into the left value.

108
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,280
So when we do this, it reassigns the value of a to be two to whatever it was before.

109
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,953
This can be bizarre to people who haven't done programming because 

110
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:53,160
it seems like you have an equation that you're solving for something.

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,920
But in this case, the left-hand side is getting changed.

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,480
It's an operation on it.

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,468
So if I do that again, I take that same process of turning a into two to the power of 

114
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:07,127
whatever it was before, and then I'll just print it out in the same line so we can 

115
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,169
say it turns into four, that turns into 16, that is going to turn into, 

116
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,211
you can try to make a prediction here, it will turn into two to the 16, 

117
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,840
which we just saw was 65,536.

118
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,364
If I take one more step, which would be a power tower of height five, 

119
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:25,080
so just five twos stacked on top of each other, it totally explodes.

120
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,775
It's just this monstrous number, which I think it's awfully 

121
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,820
kind of Python to even do the work to find the number for us.

122
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,940
I'm impressed with it.

123
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,568
And if we wanted, we could say, okay, think of that number as a string, 

124
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:42,980
what's the length of that string, and it's telling us the number of digits that are in it.

125
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,100
So the number we have there is a 19,000-digit expression, just monstrously huge.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,733
And if we were to try one more iteration of this, 

127
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,658
turning a into two to the power of that 19,000-digit monstrosity, 

128
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,940
you would not be able to store the information required for that number.

129
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,752
Any way that you were using matter to encode all the digits of whatever would come out, 

130
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:08,683
if that was within the confines of something like the radius of the Earth, 

131
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:13,400
you would absolutely create a black hole in any attempt to store that kind of information.

132
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,562
So just a power tower of height six, and it's well beyond 

133
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,440
what you can literally physically convey in any kind of way.

134
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,100
So you might ask, how quickly does this thing blow up for other numbers, if it's not two?

135
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,857
And one thing that I'm going to ask you, actually just in the live poll, 

136
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,929
let's go ahead and pull it up, is to predict what's going to 

137
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,700
happen here if instead of two we were dealing with 1.1.

138
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,134
So if you go to the link that's in the description and up on the screen to answer 

139
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:45,982
the live questions along with us, we are asked, let B equal 1.1, 

140
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:50,778
so just a little above one, and consider an expression of the form B to the B to 

141
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:54,034
the B to the B, this power tower, and its height is n, 

142
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,580
meaning you'll see n different copies of B.

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,820
How big does n have to be?

144
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,378
How many times do you have to repeat this operation before 

145
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:05,360
the value of the expression has more than ten digits?

146
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,180
So with two, we had to get to a tower of size five before that happened.

147
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,860
It jumped from being a five-digit number to a 19,000-digit number.

148
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,320
So how many times would you have to do it for a value of B equals 1.1?

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,602
And I'll give you a moment to answer that while we listen 

150
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,120
to the soothing tones of construction maybe slowing down.

151
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,962
And just to illustrate this process here, if we hop back over to Python, 

152
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:38,394
and let me just pop on over here, get back into my terminal, 

153
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:41,300
let's say I started A at a value of one.

154
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,800
Let's just do this in a for loop.

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
So for n in some kind of range like 50.

156
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm going to reassign A.

157
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,164
What if instead of doing repeated exponentiation, 

158
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:53,580
I was just repeatedly multiplying it by 1.1?

159
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,220
So just repeated multiplication, which should be exponentiation.

160
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,460
You can get a sense of how quickly that grows.

161
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,444
And if we take a look here at the first 50 values, you know, it starts at 1.1, 

162
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:08,969
it goes to 1.21, and at each stage it's actually growing just by a little bit, 

163
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:12,520
by 10% with each jump, and you get classic exponential growth.

164
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,300
So with 50 steps it took us up to 117.

165
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,300
That's exponential growth.

166
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,100
So you might wonder what is tetrational growth?

167
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,780
What happens if we're repeatedly exponentiating this thing?

168
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,860
And before I answer that, let me see what you think.

169
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,080
What do you think is going to happen here if we repeatedly exponentiate this?

170
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,400
Okay.

171
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,220
So the correct answer is that it actually never grows past anything like that.

172
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,260
And, ah, interesting, that's the third placed answer.

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,520
So most of you thought that the height that you would need would be between 10 and 100.

174
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,740
Doing it between 10 and 100 times, that would blow you up past 10 digits.

175
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,425
The second most common answer was thinking it was between 1 and 10, 

176
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,740
which would be very analogous to how 2 was growing.

177
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,953
Third most common, and I'm wondering how many of those third most common people have 

178
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:09,245
seen this process before, because it's very weird the idea that repeatedly multiplying 

179
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:11,614
it by itself, that'll grow as much as you want, 

180
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:15,117
but that somehow doing what feels like a much more powerful operation, 

181
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,880
repeatedly exponentiating, that actually stays confined.

182
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,532
And we can see this bear out in practice if we hop back over to our Python, 

183
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:28,223
where now what I'm doing with each iteration, and I guess I should set a to b, 

184
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:32,440
1 again, I'm going to repeatedly turn it into 1 to the power of itself.

185
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,748
And what we get is a little bit of initial growth, but it quickly slows down, 

186
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:41,940
and just within 20 iterations it actually stays fixed at this value.

187
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,080
You can see that this digit isn't changing.

188
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,571
And if you think through what's going on there, evidently when a is equal to that value, 

189
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:55,974
and you take 1.1 to the power of that value, so 1.1 to the power of this thing, 

190
00:11:55,974 --> 00:12:01,040
that's 1.1117, ah, don't type it too many times, that actually stays fixed.

191
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,400
You get the same value that you had before.

192
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,893
So another way that we can phrase this is to say that the 

193
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,814
equation 1.1 to the power x equals x, something where when 

194
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,200
you plug it into the function you get itself, this has a solution.

195
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,980
This didn't hold when we were doing it with 2.

196
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,440
If we had 2 to the x equals x, if you try to think through different answers to this, 

197
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,917
it's a funky equation to think about, but if you just try out some values 

198
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:31,769
like 0 and 1 or anything in between, you'll find there's actually no answer here, 

199
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,260
whereas evidently we just saw an answer in this case.

200
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,534
And what that means for our iterative process, 

201
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:40,670
if instead of 2 at the base it was 1.1 at the base, 

202
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,193
you'd have this situation where the previous value, you raise 1.1 to that, 

203
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:46,400
it just stays fixed.

204
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,860
And now this starts raising a lot of interesting questions.

205
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,300
First of all, where's the switch?

206
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,580
What number between 1 and 2 is the point where it goes from staying finite to blowing up?

207
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,540
And blowing up incredibly quickly at that.

208
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,823
Remember with 2 it only took us 5 iterations before we had something that was, 

209
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:06,280
you know, beyond what the computer could handle.

210
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,034
And we could play around with this a little bit, 

211
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:13,748
but I think another interesting product of the fact that this 

212
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:18,720
can convert at all is we can start answering what look like very bizarre questions.

213
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,108
Where I can say, imagine I have an unknown value x, 

214
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:26,800
and I do not a power tower of some finite size, but of an infinite size.

215
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,525
I'm going to keep going forever in the same way 

216
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,860
that evidently I can do with a base of 1.1.

217
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,700
Can I find a value of x where this converges?

218
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,840
For example, to 4.

219
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
This is the question posed in the thumbnail of the video.

220
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,640
And what we just saw is that we could find a value that converges to 1.111782, on and on.

221
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,620
That's evidently a value you can converge to, and the solution would be 1.1.

222
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,280
But how do you go the other way around?

223
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,940
How can we actually solve for the idea that we can find a value of x that equals 4?

224
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,980
And there's a clever trick here that you might spot.

225
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,038
And this comes up in certain problem solving kinds of math where you have this 

226
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:08,840
infinite expression, and you say, hmm, there's some self-similarity I can leverage.

227
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,920
There's a copy of the entire power tower inside itself.

228
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,140
Because it's infinite, it's a genuine copy of itself.

229
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,680
It doesn't have a height of 1 minus whatever the previous height was.

230
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,900
Because the height is infinity.

231
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,162
And under the assumption that the whole power tower equals 4, 

232
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:30,400
I could replace that with a 4 and solve x to the fourth equals 4.

233
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,320
Let's see, what would that be?

234
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,600
If I take square roots, that's the same as saying x squared equals 2.

235
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,377
So it looks like, interesting, x equals square root 

236
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:44,840
of 2 gives me a power tower that should converge to 4.

237
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,900
Kind of funky.

238
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,650
The idea that anything converges at all is sort of weird, but the idea that, you know, 

239
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,940
square root of 2 would go to a clean value, like an integer, that's kind of surprising.

240
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,344
And let me actually ask you another question where I'm going to have you 

241
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:03,215
apply the same tactic that we just did, leveraging that self-similarity 

242
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:07,247
to solve another one of these situations, where you're looking for a power 

243
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:11,280
tower with an unknown base and seeing when it equals a pre-specified value.

244
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,684
So this time the question is going to ask us, if 

245
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:17,040
we give it just a little moment to pull up here.

246
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,880
Well, it's taking a little moment, which is fine.

247
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,700
Ah, great.

248
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,211
The question asks us, using the tactic just demonstrated, what I just did for 4, 

249
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:32,800
solve the equation x to the x to the x on and on up to infinity equals 2.

250
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,400
So I'll give you a moment to think that through.

251
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,160
The ground smasher is back.

252
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,820
Man, yesterday when we were doing it, we, uh, I wish I had the footage to show you.

253
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,720
Maybe I can try to pull it up on my phone or something.

254
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,010
But the things were shaking so much that just 

255
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,300
a pile of circuit boards was actively shaking.

256
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,000
Let me see if I can find this.

257
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,980
It's super funny.

258
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,313
Alright, this might not, this is probably the worst way to stream something, 

259
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:28,380
is to take an overhead camera shot of a phone.

260
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,780
But let me see if this works decently well.

261
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,840
So I was trying to get a view of the construction.

262
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,240
We move over and just the pile of circuit boards is just jittering like that.

263
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,900
And that's what we have to deal with.

264
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,880
So, hope you enjoy.

265
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,660
Now on the quiz, it looks like just about everybody is converging around the same answer.

266
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:50,424
And I'm going to assume you've landed on the correct answer, 

267
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:52,420
which is in fact the square root of 2.

268
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,231
Which is kind of a funny thing, because if we go and we do exactly the same 

269
00:16:57,231 --> 00:17:01,278
logic that we were doing for solving for 4, where we have this infinite 

270
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,111
power tower and we're assuming that it equals 2 and we recognize the self-similarity, 

271
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:09,427
we're like, ah yes, the power tower, copy of it in itself, 

272
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:13,980
so that should mean x squared equals 2, that means x equals the square root of 2.

273
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,560
Well hang on a second, this can't be right.

274
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,230
Because on the one hand this seems to be suggesting that an 

275
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,619
infinite power tower converges to 2 when the base is root 2.

276
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,640
But on the other hand it converges to 4 when the base is root 2.

277
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,859
It can't be both.

278
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,220
We've got a very deterministic process up here for what it converges.

279
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,360
So it's got to be just one of them, if any.

280
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,580
Maybe the entire logic of the situation is false.

281
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,540
So let's get empirical.

282
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,340
Let's turn to our programming to see which one of these it actually ends up being.

283
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,409
So I'll hop back over, I will reassign my variable a to be 1, 

284
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,660
I'm going to make my little loop.

285
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,000
Actually let's import math because I'm going to need a square root here.

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,700
So I'm going to say for, I don't know, we'll just do 20 at a time.

287
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,124
I'm going to take a, turn it into the square root of 2, 

288
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:04,100
square root of 2 to the power of a, print out what it looks like.

289
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,980
Guess I don't need that semicolon but it doesn't really matter.

290
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
And it looks like for those first 20 iterations 

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,100
it does kind of slow down as it approaches 2.

292
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,120
And if I do another 20 iterations it's definitely slowing down as it gets to 2.

293
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,800
Definitely, alright.

294
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,878
And now it does something kind of bizarre where it seems 

295
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:27,540
like it lands exactly on 2 but then it jumps up to 2.0004.

296
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,340
Which if you think through what's going on here, at some point it equals 2.

297
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,920
So we're saying a equals 2.

298
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,580
And then we're taking the square root of 2 to the power of that.

299
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,200
But square root of 2 to the power of 2 by definition should be 2.

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,920
So that's going to be just some simple numerical error.

301
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,440
I guess, however, the math square root library is implementing square roots.

302
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,740
You know, there's always going to be a little bit of numerical error with floating points.

303
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,220
So when we square it we don't exactly get 2 back.

304
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,600
That's fine, not a problem.

305
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,418
But it does seem to suggest that the correct answer to our question of 

306
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:04,960
what happens when we have a power tower with root 2 is that it equals 2.

307
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,640
Or that the sequence of numbers that this represents approaches 2.

308
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,560
What's wrong with the other logic though?

309
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,040
What's wrong with the logic that seemed to imply that it should equal 4?

310
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,860
Well to answer that we should do two things.

311
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,374
First is to represent this thing a little bit more visually, 

312
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:26,852
a little bit graphically so we can try to understand what is going on with this 

313
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:27,860
iterative process.

314
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,940
And then from there understand which values will converge and which values will blow up.

315
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,185
And by answering that we can get back in the direction of what's 

316
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:40,480
wrong with the logic associated with having this thing approach 4.

317
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,840
So for that let's take a look over at our good friend Desmos.

318
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,820
So pop on over here, open up Chrome.

319
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,640
Not look at that yet, that is 4 later.

320
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,120
And we will just take a look at a graph here.

321
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,340
So what I have is the line y equals x.

322
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,820
I've got a function b to the power x and I've set b to be 2.

323
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,300
So we're just looking at the graph of 2 to the x.

324
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,244
And to think about the idea of repeatedly applying a function and 

325
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:11,660
kind of taking the output and then plugging it back into the input.

326
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,880
We can draw what's commonly known as a cobweb diagram.

327
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,660
The way this will work is I have an initial value of 1 as the 

328
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,080
input and then the next value is going to be whatever f of 1 is.

329
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,020
I'm going to plug in 1 to the function.

330
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,721
And what that means is I move vertically until I 

331
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:32,780
hit the graph and in this case 2 to the 1 is just 2.

332
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,020
So I'm going to hit it at a y value of 2.

333
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,170
But from there what I want is the output that I just got, 

334
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,240
that 2, to become an input to the function.

335
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,996
But if outputs are represented on the y axis and inputs are on the x axis, 

336
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:49,500
what I need is some point where the y value is the same as the x value.

337
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,447
So if I walk horizontally until the y value is the same as the x value, 

338
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,080
I'll get to a point where 2 is the x value.

339
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,380
Where I can now think of that 2 as being the input.

340
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,280
And to do that I walk until I hit the line y equals x.

341
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,700
Because once I hit that I'm looking at 2 comma 2.

342
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,040
So I can treat that 2 as an input by moving vertically until I hit the graph.

343
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,300
You can see how that works.

344
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,392
Meaning the next point in our iterative process is going to 

345
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:20,080
be 2 to the power of what we just had, which is 2 squared or 4.

346
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,456
And then I move over to the right, turning my output into an input, 

347
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:28,480
looking for what point on the plane has an x value that's also equal to 4.

348
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,465
Then once I hit that, I kind of think of bouncing off of this line, 

349
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:36,100
y equals x, and moving vertically until I hit the graph again.

350
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,920
And this time it's not until 16 that I hit the graph.

351
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,020
And then I move to the right until x also equals 16.

352
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,505
And then from there, I have to go quite a while, 

353
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:49,580
quite a while moving vertically, but it will happen quite a while.

354
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,760
And around 65,000 it intersects the graph again.

355
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,265
And then it's going to move to the right until 

356
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:57,320
we get to an x coordinate that's also 65,000.

357
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,620
And from there, Desmos just totally gives up on trying to draw the next vertical line.

358
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,224
Because as we saw, what it would have to get to is a height 

359
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:09,020
where the number describing that height is a 19,000 digit number.

360
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,840
So it just gives up on us there.

361
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,315
But when we think in terms of these cobweb diagrams, 

362
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:18,640
now if I start playing with what is that base, you can see what's going to happen.

363
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,820
What is that base?

364
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,820
The base is the ground-smashing activity.

365
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,720
At some point, the graphs actually cross each other.

366
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,260
So in particular, we were looking at 1.1 earlier, and that, yeah, they absolutely cross.

367
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,845
But even up to around 1.41, which is around the square root of 2, 

368
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:40,436
if you look at what happens with this process, we look at the output, 

369
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:44,386
turn the output into an input, look at the new output, output into an input, 

370
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:45,720
and bounce back and forth.

371
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,680
We're bouncing towards the value where these graphs intersect each other.

372
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,540
Towards the value where b to the power x is equal to x.

373
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,582
And in particular, if that base was the square root of 2, 

374
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:04,331
and I say find a solution of square root of 2 to the power x equals x, 

375
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:08,238
you know, it's not easy to think about how you solve this systematically, 

376
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:12,145
but for this particular case, you would believe me if I told you that the 

377
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:13,360
solution is x equals 2.

378
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,080
You can just plug that in and solve it.

379
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,980
So if we look at our graph, if b, actually let's go ahead and make it 

380
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,460
precisely the square root of 2 rather than just an approximation here.

381
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,900
So b is going to be the square root of 2, no, of 2.

382
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,858
The intersection point is exactly at 2, so you 

383
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:32,860
see your iterative process approaching that.

384
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,360
Okay, that's kind of interesting.

385
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,782
This also shows us how we're going to need to think about it if we want to be, 

386
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:42,308
if we want to understand where the switch happens between when 

387
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,940
things converge and when things don't converge.

388
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:51,836
Because what we want is knowing what value of b should I go to where things can escape, 

389
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:55,821
there is no intersection point, to where things don't escape, 

390
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:58,200
where there is an intersection point.

391
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,795
And by the way, I've left the link to this particular Desmos graph in the description, 

392
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:06,580
so if you want to hop down there and just play along, you're more than welcome to.

393
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,391
One thing I should specify, the fact that they intersect, 

394
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:14,304
that's actually not enough to ensure that this cobweb iterative process 

395
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:15,500
necessarily converges.

396
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,361
It's important that the graph of our function, 

397
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:22,480
which in this case is b to the x, intersects at a slope that's less than 1.

398
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,440
And we can think about why that's true.

399
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,436
If I turn a new leaf, let's say I wasn't dealing with exponential 

400
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:34,200
functions or curves like that, I was just dealing with any generic function.

401
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,474
So look at the line y equals x, and let's say I have some function which, 

402
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:44,500
you know, it squiggles along and it intersects it but with a slope greater than 1.

403
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,891
Then when we do our iterative process, we'll have some output and we say 

404
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:52,880
let's turn it into an input by walking horizontally until we hit y equals x.

405
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,620
Look at the new output by walking vertically.

406
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,640
Smash, smash, smash.

407
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,111
Look at the new input, or turn that output into 

408
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:05,860
an input by walking horizontally until we hit it.

409
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
And then repeat that process.

410
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,805
You can see that's what's happening because it intersected with a slope greater than 1, 

411
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:14,240
we're actually walking away from the intersection point.

412
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,025
So to make sure that it's not just a stable point, 

413
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:19,702
it's not just a common point between the graphs, 

414
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:22,160
but it's stable when you repeat this process.

415
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,900
That slope does need to be less than 1.

416
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,440
I have a whole video about another perspective on how to think about this kind of process.

417
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,159
I think I gave it an absurd title, like what they won't teach you in calculus, 

418
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,030
but if you want to see more examples of this and fun, 

419
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,380
infinite iterated objects, that's a place that you can turn to.

420
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,680
Now, in our case, it is the case that the slope is less than 1, so that works.

421
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,720
Although, on the second intersection point, that's actually a slope greater than 1.

422
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,483
So if I changed the iterative process where my first value wasn't 1, 

423
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:57,688
but in this case if I made it 4, then my iterative process would actually run 

424
00:25:57,688 --> 00:26:01,157
away from the intersection point, like you can see, 

425
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:03,760
and it will indeed blow up to infinity.

426
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,620
So that's always fun.

427
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,300
I'll change that back to a 1.

428
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,477
You can take a look at my little note for being annoyed that you can't do four 

429
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:18,600
loops of recursion in Desmos definitions, and you can see what we need to solve.

430
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,704
One thing that's kind of fun here is at 1.45, which seems just above a point 

431
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:28,609
where they actually intersect, you have this bouncing and bouncing that just 

432
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:33,260
stays somewhat stable for such a long time before it eventually blows up.

433
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,050
And imagine trying to think about this not graphically, 

434
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,840
but if you were just playing around with it numerically.

435
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,688
So if we had taken the same process we did before, where A starts out at 1, 

436
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:47,053
we're going to do a bunch of iterative exponentiating, 

437
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:49,500
but we're going to make it 1.45 instead.

438
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,600
And let's give ourselves like 50 values for this one.

439
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,680
The process eventually blows up.

440
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,920
It gives us this overflow error.

441
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,943
But the processes would be very confusing if you 

442
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:02,280
didn't have any visual for what's going on.

443
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,599
It starts at 1.45, it grows, it stays kind of not stable, 

444
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,440
but it doesn't seem to be moving that much in the 2.71828 region.

445
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,040
For some reason around there it just seems awfully slow moving.

446
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,500
But as it starts to get a little bit bigger into the 3 region it stays there for a while.

447
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,340
The 4 region there's two values.

448
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:27,400
Then 6, and then 9, and then 39, and then it just blows up to 2 million after that.

449
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,680
And then from there it's bigger than what the computer can handle.

450
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,820
So that would be deeply confusing, except we have a nice understanding of what's going on.

451
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,420
The graphs almost touch, but they don't quite.

452
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,600
So somewhere between 1.44 and 1.45 is what we're looking for.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,462
And you might think of this now in terms of calculus, 

454
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:50,941
where what we want is to know when the tangent of this graph is the same as 

455
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,120
the line y equals x.

456
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,120
When does the graph b to the x lie tangent to the line y equals x?

457
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,866
And rather than me setting up the equations that we need to solve for that, 

458
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:02,220
I'm going to have you do the same.

459
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm going to have you take a look at this condition of looking for a value of b.

460
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,580
Well let's just read what the question asks us more specifically.

461
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,036
We want a value of b such that the graph of y equals 

462
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:20,420
b to the x sits tangent to the graph y equals x.

463
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,860
Which of the following represents the pair of equations that we need to solve?

464
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,440
Okay, so take a moment to think about this.

465
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,910
Which of the following is the pair of equations that we need to solve?

466
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:50,607
While you're thinking about that, I'll go ahead 

467
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,350
and take a couple questions from the audience.

468
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,950
We have...

469
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,910
So immediately I wondered, repeat-detectration is pentation.

470
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,670
Or is that even a useful idea?

471
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,630
Yeah, there's this whole notation that talks about the idea of repeating these processes.

472
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,930
It's called Knuth arrow notation.

473
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,030
And you can kind of have as many as you want.

474
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,085
So the way this works is that if I write something like a arrow b, 

475
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:20,530
that's the same thing as a to the power b.

476
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,390
But then a with two arrows is the repetition of that process.

477
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,270
You know, b times.

478
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,250
And, sorry, that's a two arrows and then a b.

479
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,926
If I had three arrows, three arrows and then a b, 

480
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:41,030
then what I'm repeating is the process of doing a double arrow.

481
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,110
Which is really mind-warpingly big as you start to think about it for numbers.

482
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,790
Even numbers like two and three.

483
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:52,070
The idea of repeating this process some number of times is just crazy.

484
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,530
And you could just keep going with more and more arrows.

485
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,777
And if any of you have not learned about Gram's constant, 

486
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:01,610
go over to that number file right now and see how Gram's constant is defined.

487
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,770
Because it involves these sort of arrow operations and it's genuinely crazy.

488
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,041
And it's one of the most mind-blowing moments you'll have in 

489
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,350
your mathematical life the first time you see Gram's constant.

490
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,490
So I would recommend.

491
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,639
Alright, so next we have for 1.1 to the power x equals x, 

492
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,350
Wolfram Alpha yields two real solutions.

493
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,470
Ooh, excellent question.

494
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,550
One of them is the one that we converge to.

495
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,790
The other is around 38.29.

496
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,450
Awesome.

497
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,870
What's the deal with that second solution?

498
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,510
We can take a look exactly in the graph that we have.

499
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,850
So if we take b and we make it 1.1.

500
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:36,830
Okay.

501
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,404
It's what I was talking about how at the place where it intersects with a 

502
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:45,270
slope greater than one, yeah, it's a fixed point for our iterative process.

503
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,050
But it's not a stable fixed point.

504
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,930
So up here is that 38 value that you were just referencing.

505
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,639
And because it intersects at a slope that's bigger than one, 

506
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:57,488
even if you were to seed the process with a value that's really near there, 

507
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,210
it would run away from that value.

508
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,316
So if you're seeding the process, if you're starting off at a value of a equals one, 

509
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:06,070
this is the intersection point that it'll end up finding.

510
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,450
That's an outstanding question.

511
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,770
And third, are there practical use cases for such an operation as tetration?

512
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,430
I've studied very scientific branch and have never come across this operator.

513
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,190
I'm very curious.

514
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,590
Okay, so that is a spot on question.

515
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,735
So I will talk a little bit about a role with chaos and fractals at the end, 

516
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:30,437
which is tenuous at best because it's saying it's related to other things which 

517
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:31,730
themselves are useful.

518
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,240
I can't personally think of a place where you're out in 

519
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,970
the wild doing science and then boom, tetration pops up.

520
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,724
I can think of a puzzle, like a sort of brainteaser type puzzle 

521
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:45,830
where you would not at all think this operation comes up, but it does.

522
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,550
Which, if we have time at the end, I think I might share with you.

523
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,389
I would say the motivation for learning this kind of thing right now is, 

524
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:56,172
pardon the scene switching chaos there, is just that the process for actually 

525
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:58,742
solving the puzzles that are sitting in front of us, 

526
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,894
understanding what was up with the repeated tower equaling four, 

527
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:05,628
and understanding what we're about to find, and where is the switching point 

528
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:08,150
between things converging and things not converging.

529
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,269
Those are problem solving tactics that carry over into other 

530
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:14,390
things you might do that involve more practical iterative processes.

531
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,230
And iterative processes absolutely do come up all throughout science.

532
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,450
I mean, chaos theory is like the big one there.

533
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,716
So with all of that as the answering people's question side, 

534
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:27,962
and I'll take more through Twitter as we go and probably do more of that at the end, 

535
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:30,010
let's see how you've done on our problem.

536
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,936
So we're looking for a system of equations here, and the correct answer, 

537
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:39,542
which 1777 of you got, I think that's not quite French Revolution territory, 

538
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:43,730
but American Revolution territory of you, we got b to the x equals x, 

539
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,755
so we need them to intersect, and then moreover what we want is the slope to be the 

540
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,490
same where they do intersect.

541
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:55,118
And the derivative of b to the x is itself, but scaled by the natural log of b, 

542
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:58,341
and we want that slope to equal one, because it's got to be the 

543
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,010
same as the slope of the graph we're just looking at.

544
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:06,599
And if ever you don't remember what the derivatives of your exponential functions are, 

545
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,872
if you do remember that e to the x is its own derivative, 

546
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:14,612
which if there's any one thing you remember in calculus with respect to e to the x, 

547
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:17,490
it should be that e to the x is its own derivative.

548
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:24,367
Note that we can write b as e to the natural log of b, so then all of that to the x, 

549
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:29,285
so this is the same as expressing e to the natural log of b times x, 

550
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:35,627
we talked about this I think last lecture, so then if you want to take the derivative of 

551
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:41,329
this, take its derivative, on the one hand it should be the derivative of this, 

552
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:46,032
which by the chain rule is that constant sitting in the exponent, 

553
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:49,810
natural log of b times itself, e to the ln b times x.

554
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,956
So what we're looking at is, okay it should be itself, 

555
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:56,050
but scaled by something, and that something was the natural log of b.

556
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:03,931
Now for our puzzle of understanding when is it that our graph is going to nicely lie 

557
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:10,870
tangent to y equals x, let's solve this equation, this system of equations actually.

558
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,757
Because we're looking for the value x where that solution happens, 

559
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:19,987
we know that the curve b to the x equals x at that point, 

560
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:25,750
and we know that its slope, the natural log of b times itself, is equal to one.

561
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,333
Now to solve this, the first thing I might do is note that I 

562
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:36,406
can simplify b to the x as being x, so I would apply that over here, 

563
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:40,889
and I can write the natural log of b times x is equal to one.

564
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:47,428
And what that gives me is that b is the same as one divided by x, all very nice, 

565
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:53,270
no no no, it doesn't give me that, it gives me that the natural log of b is one over x.

566
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:01,330
That is the same statement as saying e to the one over x is equal to b.

567
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,710
Alright, now what does that buy us?

568
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,241
Well it gives us an expression for b entirely in terms of x, 

569
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:12,770
so I can go to this top part and I can get an equation that has nothing but x's in it.

570
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,312
It'll be e to the one over x, all to the power x, 

571
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:22,130
I'm just replacing the b with what we found it to be, and that is supposed to equal x.

572
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:28,538
But on the other hand, e to the one over x to the power x simplifies 

573
00:35:28,538 --> 00:35:34,210
down to simply being e, and what we found is that x is equal to e.

574
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,207
And by the way, so I was doing like a sort of a dry run of this lesson 

575
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:41,373
last night where sometimes I'll put out like a link to a stream on Twitter 

576
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,370
that's an unlisted link, and just say like as soon as a hundred of you 

577
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,410
hop on here I'm deleting the tweet and we're just going to do a dry run.

578
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:52,533
And when I was solving this, for some reason I was just confuddled for like ten minutes 

579
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:55,495
where I got to this point and I'm like that can't be right, 

580
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:59,494
because we're looking for a value that's between 1.44 and 1.45, so x can't be e, 

581
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:01,370
that's way too big, that's like 2.718.

582
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,926
So I went back and I was trying to think through like what have I done wrong, 

583
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:06,250
what on earth has gone wrong here?

584
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,869
It was mildly embarrassing because it took so long, 

585
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,462
and then I ultimately realized no, you idiot, it's not that we're 

586
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:18,290
looking for a value of x that's between 1.44 and 1.45, 

587
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,953
that was the condition for b, for the base of our exponential when 

588
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:25,250
we were playing around over here.

589
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,341
So x is just wherever they intersect, so it's fine for that to be around e, 

590
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:34,476
in fact that looks consistent that around where this point of tangency is, 

591
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:38,612
is e, which incidentally is also the output because this is happening with 

592
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:43,190
the line y equals x, so the point of tangency has coordinates e comma e, evidently.

593
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,930
And what does that mean for the value of b itself once we solve?

594
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,625
Well we have an exact expression for x, we have an expression for b in terms of x, 

595
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:57,062
so this would seem to imply that b is e to the power of 1 divided by e, 

596
00:36:57,062 --> 00:37:01,870
which is such a delightfully bizarre answer, e to the power of 1 divided by e.

597
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:06,290
And we can check with our calculator that that makes some sense, 

598
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:11,390
so if we hop on over here and I say, hey Desmos, what is e to the 1 over e?

599
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,310
Not 1 over 3, 1 over e.

600
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:20,080
Yeah, checks out, it is between 1.44 and 1.45, which is exactly what we were looking for, 

601
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,870
for the point when it goes from converging to exploding.

602
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,970
Very satisfying, I think, finding that solution, that it's e to the 1 over e.

603
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,821
As a challenge puzzle for you, if you want a little bit of homework today, 

604
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:37,190
I want you to find a lower bound on where this converges.

605
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,852
So we found the highest value that will make this converge, 

606
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:44,903
but we can also start playing with values of b that are less than 1, 

607
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:48,719
and if we do that, I'll just kind of get rid of our cobweb here, 

608
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,299
if we do that there will be some value, I guess I should keep the cobwebbing, 

609
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:56,762
where it's no longer going to zero in on some exact value, 

610
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:59,170
and it instead becomes an unstable point.

611
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,930
And the question for you is, when does that happen?

612
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,204
When does it go from approaching the point where the two graphs 

613
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:09,930
intersect to no longer approaching it because it's unstable?

614
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,956
And if you want a hint, think about the fact that the slope, 

615
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:16,752
in this case it's not a matter of when it's equal to 1, 

616
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,150
it's a matter of when it's less than negative 1.

617
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,340
And if you want another hint, it should be an 

618
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,190
expression that also involves two e's inside of it.

619
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,530
So, very fun puzzle if you want to get to it.

620
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,660
And that will give you kind of a range of convergence for what values could we have 

621
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,690
as the base in our titration such that the power tower actually converges to something.

622
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,770
And one thing that's noteworthy here is that it goes from 

623
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,850
converging to a value of e to just blowing up to infinity.

624
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,809
It never converges to values between e and infinity, 

625
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:50,349
which maybe runs against intuition because you would think that it 

626
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:54,205
somehow smoothly blows up, that rather than going, oh it converges to 1, 

627
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:58,590
it converges to 2, it converges to e, and then discontinuously jumping to infinity.

628
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,570
But that is apparently the behavior.

629
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,703
And it happens just because the graphs were once 

630
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:04,350
tangent and then that's where they separate.

631
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,050
They're kissing and then they stop kissing.

632
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,590
And this answers for us what's going on in the case of the power tower with 4.

633
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,090
So if you think back to the logic, where did we have it?

634
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:18,950
Great.

635
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,070
So if we have our power tower and I was saying solve for the value where this equals 4, 

636
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,843
well this assumes that such a value even exists, 

637
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:30,390
that this process will ever converge to be 4.

638
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,650
But we just saw that it'll never converge to be anything that's bigger than e.

639
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,652
So in particular the very first step where we make the substitution that's 

640
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:40,810
leveraging the assumption that a solution even exists, that's invalid.

641
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,012
And the reason that it worked for 2 is because 

642
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:47,010
there does exist a value where this converges to 2.

643
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,590
So when we make that initial substitution, that's a valid thing to do.

644
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,934
And before we even solved it, you could have seen that there 

645
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,730
exists a value where it converges to 2 by looking at the graphs.

646
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,696
What you would look for, even if you didn't know it was going to be square root of 2, 

647
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:04,992
what you would look for is when does this intersection point 

648
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:07,370
between the graphs happen at a y value of 2?

649
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,230
I guess it's also an x value of 2 because it's on the line y equals x.

650
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,530
But what we care about is that the y value should be 2.

651
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,209
And you would be able to empirically start seeing that hmm, 

652
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,330
it's somewhere between 1.41 and 1.42.

653
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,110
And you could binary search your way on down even a little bit further.

654
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,870
So I think that's delightful.

655
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,204
That you can take a look at this absolutely crazy singing process of a repeated 

656
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:34,150
power tower, that it converges at any points at all, which is counterintuitive.

657
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,750
And that we can actually make very substantive statements about when it converges, 

658
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,790
thinking through iterative processes like this.

659
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,670
And that's actually it for today.

660
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,990
This is going to be a shorter lesson.

661
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,913
That is the end of what I wanted to say about the power 

662
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,950
tower puzzle and leaving you with that little bit of homework.

663
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,970
So for the very end here, I just want to take a couple more questions from Twitter.

664
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,390
If you ask them with the hashtag locked down math, they might get forwarded to me.

665
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:03,510
And anything about tetration and this process is exactly what we should talk about.

666
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,970
Great.

667
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,590
So, he says, if there's a triangle of exponents, is there a square of tetration?

668
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,610
What uses are there for the inverses of tetration?

669
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,670
Well, I mean, in either case, we'd be dealing with three different variables.

670
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,910
There's the idea of what's the base, what's the height, and then what's the output.

671
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,670
So in either case, we'd just be having three of them.

672
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,928
The four in tetration, like what makes it four, 

673
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:33,384
is not the fact that there's three relevant numbers, you know, the base, the exponent, 

674
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:34,870
and then whatever the output.

675
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,330
And then some new fourth thing.

676
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,871
It's that in this process of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, 

677
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:43,930
it's kind of the fourth of our like repeating the process before.

678
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,430
Next question from ML.

679
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,264
Will you show us part of the fractal set of complex numbers x 

680
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:51,690
for which the power tower x to the x to the x to the x converges?

681
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,470
I'm so happy that you asked, ML.

682
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,778
Yes, you might wonder what happens if instead of our base equaling two, 

683
00:41:57,778 --> 00:42:01,369
or instead of our base equaling square root of two, or 1.4, 

684
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:06,456
or all the values we were just looking at, what if you have some complex number like 

685
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:08,970
z that you're raising to a repeated power?

686
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,060
Now there's a little bit of nuance there for what exactly 

687
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,410
it means to raise complex values to other complex values.

688
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,730
And I think I'm going to talk about that.

689
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,710
Don't hold me to it.

690
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,770
I think I'll talk about that in the next lecture.

691
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,500
It's very similar to what we see with real values where you 

692
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,818
can re-express it in terms of e, and then because we know how 

693
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:30,190
to think about e with complex numbers, you'll be able to do it.

694
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:35,961
But if you are willing to grant the fact that there does exist a way that you 

695
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:41,390
can extend exponentiation to complex numbers, you could certainly repeat it.

696
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,390
And when you repeat it, you can start asking about does this converge?

697
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,825
And if you ask about when it converges, and if you go and you write a 

698
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:51,212
shader or whatever your favorite kind of program is to color all the 

699
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:55,090
pixels on the plane based on whether or not it converges, this is what you get.

700
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,295
So what you're looking at right now, the axes aren't labeled, 

701
00:42:59,295 --> 00:43:03,535
but the real axis is running across the middle of the screen from around negative 

702
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:04,570
4.5 up to I think 3.

703
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:09,450
And then the imaginary axis that's going from I think like negative 2i up to 2i.

704
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,471
So this horizontal part of blackness corresponds to all the values that 

705
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:17,603
converge that we just found, where the upper bound was e to the 1 over e, 

706
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:21,290
and the lower bound is what you can find for homework if you want.

707
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,712
But the other values above that diverge, and the 

708
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:28,390
coloring tells you how quickly they diverge.

709
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,302
So yellow means that it explodes very quickly, 

710
00:43:31,302 --> 00:43:34,370
blue means that it explodes less quickly, and so on.

711
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,846
And so evidently what happens is as you allow for complex numbers, 

712
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:40,907
even if their real part is greater than e to the 1 over e, 

713
00:43:40,907 --> 00:43:45,006
that imaginary part can conspire in just such a way that it makes it converge, 

714
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:49,261
and you get this totally intricate pattern, very analogous to the Mandelbrot set, 

715
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:52,530
which is also defined in terms of a certain repeated operation.

716
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,874
And what this indicates is there's actually a lot more intricacy than you 

717
00:43:56,874 --> 00:44:00,750
might expect associated with these power towers and this titration operation.

718
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,871
And you get this a lot where repeated applications of something can yield chaos, 

719
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:11,056
and that chaos is often pictorially reflected in the fact that a fractal emerges, 

720
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:15,482
and it's kind of like the intricacy of the image is paralleled in the 

721
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:19,150
difficulty of predicting what the outputs are going to be.

722
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,641
And just to illustrate the fact that the outputs can be difficult to predict, 

723
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:26,050
you want to know what an unsolved problem is, what no one in the world actually knows?

724
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,555
Is if you can ever take a power tower with pis, 

725
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:34,890
so pi to the power pi to the power pi to the power pi, you do that.

726
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,350
At any point, is this ever equal to an integer?

727
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,168
Almost certainly not, it would seem highly unlikely because it's 

728
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:45,341
an irrational number and if you're thinking of it kind of probabilistically, 

729
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:47,690
but it's not probabilistic, it's a deterministic process.

730
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:53,570
In fact, we don't even know for a power tower of height 4 if there's just 4 pis here.

731
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,980
You take pi to the power pi, pi to the power of that, pi to the power of that, 

732
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,910
it ends up being a monstrous number, bigger than we can compute exactly.

733
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,230
We don't have a way to prove whether or not this is an integer.

734
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,130
And if you can prove that, you know, you will be contributing to the forefront of math.

735
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,923
That's the level of what we actually don't know about these power towers, 

736
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,350
which I think is kind of interesting.

737
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:20,990
Can I share the brainteaser where the arrow operator shows up?

738
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:21,890
Yeah, fantastic.

739
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,770
Let me, I can draw it out for you.

740
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,590
I think this came from an IMO.

741
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,794
This is something that Po-Shan-Lo was sharing with me at one 

742
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:35,925
point and I'm sure he has a talk about it somewhere that will 

743
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:40,190
be more illustrative than what I can talk about on the fly here.

744
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,330
But the way this will work is that we have 6 different cups 

745
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:48,470
and each cup is going to start out with a single coin in it.

746
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,310
And you have two different operations available to you.

747
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,324
One of those operations is that you can remove the coin from one cup, 

748
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:03,370
so we'll remove it from one cup, but then two more coins will drop into the cup 

749
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,190
to its right.

750
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,370
So there's a certain directionality to this.

751
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,290
Two more will drop into the one to its right.

752
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,695
So you can imagine from here we can then eliminate all three 

753
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:15,750
coins and then there would be six that just magically drop in.

754
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,690
Five, six, magically drop into the next cup beside it.

755
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,038
And if that was the only ability that you had, 

756
00:46:23,038 --> 00:46:27,361
kind of a warm-up teaser is to understand that the maximum number of coins 

757
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,090
you can have ends up being 63.

758
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,742
If you just sort of keep doing this process of taking out coins, 

759
00:46:32,742 --> 00:46:35,890
doubling it, but shifted one over, you can get up to 63.

760
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,492
Now if I introduce the second magical operation, 

761
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:43,032
which is that I can eliminate one of the coins in a cup, 

762
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:46,571
and instead of magically dropping two into the next one, 

763
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:49,490
I swap the two that are sitting right after it.

764
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,470
I swap their positions.

765
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,722
That's the second power that you have, which seems less magical 

766
00:46:53,722 --> 00:46:56,570
because it doesn't require bringing about coins from the ether.

767
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,196
I think the way that this was originally framed is, 

768
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:05,684
is the maximum amount of money that you can have after doing 

769
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:11,350
this process bigger or smaller than 2010 to the power 2010 to the power 2010?

770
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,110
That was the question.

771
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,063
When you have these two abilities and you start with six cups that each have one 

772
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:21,896
coin in them, will it be bigger, the maximum amount of money that you can get if 

773
00:47:21,896 --> 00:47:25,730
you're clever enough, be bigger or smaller than that power tower of height three?

774
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:31,221
And it's just, again, kind of absurd that that second operation would get you 

775
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:36,010
anywhere near that level of number because this is, I mean, this is just so huge.

776
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,250
It's way bigger than anything you'll find in physics.

777
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,270
Unless you're doing statistical mechanics or something like that.

778
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,530
So, yeah, excellent question.

779
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:50,810
And with that, unless there's anything more that people want to ask and which also ends 

780
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:56,110
up getting forwarded to me, I think I'm going to go ahead and call it a day on this one.

781
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,210
And thank you for joining.

782
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,480
I think I will ultimately probably have ten episodes in 

783
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,290
this lockdown series is what I'm thinking at the moment.

784
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,310
So if you want to join for the next two, those will be the last two.

785
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,230
Oh, great.

786
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,390
We have another question.

787
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,666
When you solved x to the x to the x on and on equals two and got x squared equals two, 

788
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,870
you ignored the negative square root of two.

789
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,390
Awesome.

790
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:19,390
Yeah.

791
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,170
Yeah.

792
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,370
A solution to x squared equals two.

793
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,330
Can I explain why?

794
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,770
Ah, yeah, that's absolutely outstanding.

795
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,340
Let's so if we think about this graphically again, 

796
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,838
where that helps us be a little bit more concrete when it comes to what's going 

797
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:32,150
on with the iterative process.

798
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,170
When I said B equal to around one point four one.

799
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:43,250
OK, it seems like nothing's really happening around the negative square root of two.

800
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,410
OK, so let's try to understand why that's happening.

801
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,730
There's not even necessarily a an intersection at that point.

802
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,660
So the reason we were taking square roots of two when we were 

803
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,590
looking at our power tower operations, if we remind ourselves.

804
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,790
We had the assumption that there even exists an answer.

805
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,130
This whole thing.

806
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,390
No, not with an x at the top.

807
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,290
It just goes up to infinity equals two.

808
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,270
We saw the reflection of itself.

809
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,510
X squared equals two.

810
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,170
Let's think about what this would mean.

811
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,990
What do we mean to have a negative square root here?

812
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:23,390
Well, I guess what you'd be assuming is that you you're taking negative powers.

813
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,169
Now that I think about it.

814
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,230
If we said x equal to the negative square root of two.

815
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,130
Then you'd be raising it in the next process.

816
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,310
You would take negative square root of two.

817
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,130
You would raise it to a negative power.

818
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,530
OK, so raising to a negative power.

819
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:44,390
We're already in the realm of thinking about negative square root of two to the one over.

820
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:50,550
No, negative one over square root of two to the square root of two.

821
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:56,190
Why doesn't that end up popping up in the intersection or anything like that?

822
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,724
Actually, the more I think about it, there might be a 

823
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:02,830
very obvious answer to what's going on that I'm missing.

824
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,550
Other than I mean, we can talk about.

825
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,210
We can talk about the fact that negative numbers don't sit in the range of convergence.

826
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:16,447
Like if you solve the homework problem, the assumption that 

827
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,437
there exists an x that's negative that converges like this 

828
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:24,630
would be false because you'll find that the the bound ends up.

829
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,630
I think it ends up being e to the negative e.

830
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,950
So in the same way that it failed, our logic failed in the case of four.

831
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,650
Our logic fails if we just plug in square root of negative two.

832
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,710
I'm kind of curious if that breaks down numerically.

833
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:43,830
So if we do try this over in our python where let's again set equal to one.

834
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,410
Let's find our for loop.

835
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:50,310
We're now we're going to do the negative square root of two and repeat the process.

836
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,290
Yeah, what do we get?

837
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,150
We do get a stable point.

838
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,430
Interesting.

839
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:00,790
Negative square root of two.

840
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,610
You look like you're a very stable point.

841
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,110
You're not a stable point that's equal to two at all.

842
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,110
What is that number?

843
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,170
What's going on there?

844
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:13,710
You know what?

845
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,350
I'm not entirely positive.

846
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,050
Now that now I have it now I have a decision to make it.

847
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,287
Do I try to think about what exactly is going on on 

848
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:26,730
screen live rather than just calling it into the stream?

849
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:33,250
Or do I do I think about it and then like pin that to a comment at the end?

850
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,650
What's going on with our logic exactly?

851
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,070
We're saying assume that there equals a value that converges to two.

852
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,650
If there does it's going to satisfy this property.

853
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,112
I mean because I guess what you can say is it's 

854
00:51:49,112 --> 00:51:51,250
like x equals plus or minus square root of two.

855
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,430
You try them both.

856
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,190
One of them equals one of them doesn't.

857
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:55,750
End of story.

858
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,910
I mean this happens a lot when you're doing something algebraic.

859
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,210
You have a manipulation like this.

860
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,865
You have multiple possibilities but you just kind of 

861
00:52:02,865 --> 00:52:05,290
plug them into check and one of them just doesn't work.

862
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,165
But that's always very unsatisfying because what you want is some 

863
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:10,920
sort of answer to why it looked like it was going to work but didn't.

864
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,410
So in the case of a power tower that equals four you could very clearly see why it didn't.

865
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,010
The assumption that it even converged was false.

866
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:27,341
And I guess in this case our assumption would be if we had negative root two, 

867
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:31,890
if we have a negative value, that what's sitting up here is still equal to two.

868
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,050
I don't know.

869
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,870
We saw that it doesn't.

870
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,310
We can say when you're doing this you try them 

871
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,250
both and if one of them doesn't that's all it is.

872
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,150
But that just doesn't feel satisfying to me so I'll think about that a little bit.

873
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,290
If anyone has deeper thoughts share them in the comments of course.

874
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,782
I would love to hear what you have to say as sort of a 

875
00:52:50,782 --> 00:52:53,410
like what's going on with the square root of negative two.

876
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:58,538
What does it converge to and why does it have any relation to this process which as 

877
00:52:58,538 --> 00:53:03,156
we already saw is a faulty line of reasoning and like a little bit shaky to just 

878
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:08,230
replace what's inside your infinite power tower with the assumptions you've already made.

879
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:11,350
Yeah I'll think on that.

880
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,550
Excellent question and I think that's a great place to end it.

881
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:19,355
Also I couldn't help but notice the Twitter handle for who was asking that because this 

882
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:24,857
is someone who's created these super beautiful notes for all of the lockdown series so 

883
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:25,110
far.

884
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,453
Which I've been throwing in the video descriptions just because I'm like yeah this is, 

885
00:53:29,453 --> 00:53:31,870
boy do I wish my handwriting looked anything like that.

886
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:35,110
So if anyone wants to check them out she's done a beautiful job.

887
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,850
And with that I will actually call it an end to today's lesson.

888
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,333
I'll see you at Friday at the same time for our 

889
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:42,290
second to last in the lockdown math series.
