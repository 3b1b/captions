00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
The safest way to reopen the economy soon without causing a second wave in the virus

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,600
will involve some notion of contact tracing. But there's a common misconception that this

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,720
requires tracking people's locations. A friend of mine, Nikki Case, recently wrote up a post

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,700
explaining why contact tracing is needed, and importantly, how the privacy-protecting variants

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,940
of it work. This was done in collaboration with the epidemiologist Marcel Salathe and

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,200
security researcher Carmela Trancoso. What follows is a video adaptation of that post.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,240
As far as COVID-19 cares, there are only three kinds of people. Not infected yet,

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,700
infected and contagious but with no symptoms, and infected, contagious and showing symptoms.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,260
If you have widespread testing, you can get people to self-isolate as soon as they show symptoms.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,520
The problem is that the virus still spreads because of all the contacts that happened

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,340
while people are contagious but asymptomatic. However, if when someone shows symptoms and tests

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,660
positive, you isolate not only them, but everyone they've been in contact with, you're staying one

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,300
step ahead of the virus. The old-school way to do this is with interviews, but that's slow,

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,600
it's inefficient, and frankly it's quite the intrusion on people's privacy. Another approach

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,400
in the modern world would be to ask people who've tested positive to forfeit all the geolocation

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,920
information from their phones, and then to track down the people who've been in those same spots.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,560
But now we're well into big brother territory, so do we have to sacrifice privacy for health?

18
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,080
Well, I'll just let Nicky's illustration speak for itself here.

19
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,100
There are several clever algorithms that let you alert everybody who's recently been in

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,520
contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, but without compromising the

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,500
privacy of anybody involved. Side note here, I found this very surprising. I know it shouldn't

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,280
have been, since I've gone through this dance many times of thinking something's impossible

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,480
only to see that cryptography makes it actually possible, but I would not blame anybody at all

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,860
for assuming that downloading an app that can alert everybody you've been in contact with

25
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,020
must necessarily be tracking and revealing your location and a lot of other information. The code

26
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,010
for these apps is entirely open, so you don't have to trust me or whoever wrote the app or Nicky or

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,070
anyone to believe it's doing what it really claims to be doing. Anyway, back to the post.

28
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,850
Let's see how this works with the help of Alice and Bob. Alice gets a tracing app. Every five

29
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,890
minutes her phone sends out some uniquely pseudo-random gibberish to all the nearby devices

30
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,070
using Bluetooth. Because these messages are pseudo-random, they don't use GPS and contain

31
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,790
no information about Alice's identity, not her location, not anything. It really is gibberish,

32
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,450
but the key point is that this gibberish is unique. Now, while her phone sends out messages,

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,090
it also listens for messages from nearby phones. For example, Bob's. Bob also has a privacy-first

34
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,370
tracing app that's compatible with, or the same, as Alice's. If Alice and Bob stay close to each

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,610
other for more than five minutes, their phones will exchange respective strings of unique gibberish.

36
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,510
Both of these phones remember all of the messages that they said and heard over the last 14 days.

37
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,870
Again, because the random messages contain no information, Alice's privacy is protected from

38
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:28,690
Bob and vice versa. The next day, Alice develops a dry cough and a fever. Alice gets tested.

39
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,390
Alice has COVID-19. This is not a good day for Alice. But she won't suffer in vain. Alice tells

40
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,790
her app to upload all of the random gibberish messages that it's been sending out to a hospital

41
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,170
database. And to do this, she uses a one-time passcode given to her by her doctor. This code

42
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,610
is to prevent spam. The database then stores Alice's gibberish, and again, the random messages

43
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,050
give no information about Alice, where she was, who she was with, what she was doing,

44
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,390
or even how many people Alice met. It really is meaningless to the hospital. But it's not

45
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,630
meaningless to Bob's phone. Bob's phone often checks this hospital list of random messages

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,150
that have come in from COVID-19 positive cases. Essentially, the hospital's database is saying

47
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,170
to all the phones out there, hey, we just got this new random gibberish. If you've seen that

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,550
same random gibberish sometime in the last 14 days, it means you've been in contact with someone

49
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,610
who just tested positive for COVID-19. Once Bob's phone recognizes some of these numbers that are

50
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,130
the gibberish snippets now known to be associated with positive test cases, it can warn Bob to self

51
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,310
quarantine. And so Bob cuts off the chain of transmissions. We're staying one step ahead of

52
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,850
the virus. And that's it. That's how digital contact tracing apps can proactively prevent

53
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,770
the spread of COVID-19 while also protecting our rights. Thanks, Alice and Bob. Stay safe.

54
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,450
One important thing to realize is that you don't need everyone to have these apps.

55
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,250
Estimates have it that about 60% would do the trick for COVID-19.

56
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,530
Even if you can't catch all possible contacts, what you need is to catch enough so that the

57
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,050
spread of coronavirus shifts from growing exponentially to shrinking exponentially.

58
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,690
For those of you who know what this means, what we need is for R to drop below one.

59
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,650
The author of the post that this video is an adaptation of is a friend of mine,

60
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,250
Nikki Case, who is a brilliant programmer and artist. He often makes these interactive

61
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,370
explanations of societally important ideas, including a new one all about what happens

62
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,490
next with COVID-19. So I would highly recommend taking a look at his work if you get the chance.

63
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,230
He kindly made this post public domain and moreover helped me in putting together this video.

64
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,270
Any reasonable plan for reopening the economy without causing a second wave in the virus

65
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,870
will include some kind of contact tracing. And given how counterintuitive the privacy

66
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,790
protection here can be, I wanted to do all that I could to help amplify this message.

67
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,290
If you agree, please do share either Nikki's original post or this video adaptation of it.

68
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,810
And since the time that Nikki posted that, Apple and Google have put out press releases about their

69
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,710
own interoperable contact tracing systems. And I'll tell you, I'm one of those people who

70
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,350
aggressively turns off location tracking as much as I can on my phone, no matter how annoying the

71
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,470
apps can be about asking. I'm looking at you, Fitbit. But I'm 100% on board with these apps,

72
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,290
because it's not tracking your location or anything like that. And if you're a nerd like me

73
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,090
who wants to dig into the cryptography a bit, I would recommend looking at the white paper and

74
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,930
the code for the DP3T algorithm, for which I've left links in the description. And as a final

75
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,830
note, among the many unfortunate consequences of the lockdowns is a spike in calls to mental

76
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,330
health services, like the suicide prevention hotline. If somebody that you know is at risk

77
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,850
of suicide, give them a call, make sure they're doing okay. And if you're at risk, take a look

78
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,670
at the resources in the description. And if it's an option, reach out to the people in your life

79
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,990
to talk about what you're going through.
