00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
The safest way to reopen the economy soon without causing a second wave in the virus

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,520
will involve some notion of contact tracing. But there's a common misconception that this

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,720
requires tracking people's locations. A friend of mine, Nikki Case, recently wrote up a post

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,760
explaining why contact tracing is needed, and importantly, how the privacy-protecting variants

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,800
of it work. This was done in collaboration with the epidemiologist Marcel Salathe and

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,000
the security researcher Carmela Trancoso. What follows is a video adaptation of that post.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,360
As far as COVID-19 cares, there are only three kinds of people. Not infected yet,

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,640
infected and contagious but with no symptoms, and infected, contagious and showing symptoms.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,560
If you have widespread testing, you can get people to self-isolate as soon as they show symptoms.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,560
The problem is that the virus still spreads because of all the contacts that happened

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,320
while people are contagious but asymptomatic. However, if when someone shows symptoms and tests

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,600
positive, you isolate not only them, but everyone they've been in contact with, you're staying one

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,360
step ahead of the virus. The old-school way to do this is with interviews, but that's slow,

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,560
it's inefficient, and frankly it's quite the intrusion on people's privacy. Another approach

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,440
in the modern world would be to ask people who've tested positive to forfeit all the geolocation

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
from their phones, and then track down the people who've been in those same spots.

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
But now we're well into big brother territory, so do we have to sacrifice privacy for health?

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,800
Well, I'll just let Nicky's illustration speak for itself here.

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,400
There are several clever algorithms that let you alert everybody who's recently been in contact

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,600
with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, but without compromising the privacy of anybody

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,200
involved. Side note here, I found this very surprising. I know it shouldn't have been since

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,440
many times of thinking something's impossible only to see that cryptography makes it possible,

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,320
but I would not blame anybody at all for assuming that downloading an app that can alert everybody

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,720
you've been in contact with must necessarily be tracking and revealing your location.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,040
The code for these apps is entirely open, so you don't have to trust me or whoever wrote the app,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,880
or Nicky, or anyone to believe it's doing what it really claims to be doing.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Anyway, back to the post.

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,760
Let's see how this works with the help of Alice and Bob. Alice gets a tracing app. Every five

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,240
minutes her phone sends out some uniquely pseudo-random gibberish to all the nearby

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,640
devices using Bluetooth. Because these messages are pseudo-random, they don't use GPS, and they

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,800
contain no information about Alice's identity, not her location, not anything. It really is gibberish,

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,640
but the key point is that this gibberish is unique. Now, while her phone sends out messages,

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,040
it also listens for messages from nearby phones. For example, Bob's. Bob also has a privacy-first

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,280
tracing app that's compatible with, or the same, as Alice's. If Alice and Bob stay close to each

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,040
other for more than five minutes, their phones will exchange respective strings of unique gibberish.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,400
Both of these phones remember all of the messages that they said and heard over the last 14 days.

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,880
Again, because the random messages contain no information, Alice's privacy is protected from

38
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:29,040
Bob and vice versa. The next day, Alice develops a dry cough and a fever. Alice gets tested,

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,360
Alice has COVID-19. This is not a good day for Alice. But she won't suffer in vain. Alice tells

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,800
her app to upload all of the random gibberish messages that it's been sending out to a hospital

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,160
database. To do this, she uses a one-time passcode given to her by her doctor. This code

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,640
is to prevent spam. The database then stores Alice's gibberish, and again, the random messages

43
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
give no information about Alice, where she was, who she was with, what she was doing, or even how

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,520
many people Alice met. It really is meaningless to the hospital. But it's not meaningless to Bob's

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,480
phone. Bob's phone often checks this hospital list of random messages that have come in from

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,840
COVID-19 positive cases. Essentially, the hospital's database is saying to all the phones

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,880
out there, hey, we just got this new random gibberish. If you've seen that same random

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,840
gibberish sometime in the last 14 days, it means you've been in contact with someone who just

49
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,600
tested positive for COVID-19. Once Bob's phone recognizes some of these numbers that are the

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,800
gibberish snippets now known to be associated with positive test cases, it can warn Bob to

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,320
self-quarantine. And so Bob cuts off the chain of transmissions. We're staying one step ahead of the

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,160
virus. And that's it. That's how digital contact tracing apps can proactively prevent the spread

53
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,520
of COVID-19 while also protecting our rights. Thanks, Alice and Bob. Stay safe.

54
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
One important thing to realize is that you don't need everyone to have these apps.

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
Estimates have it that about 60% would do the trick for COVID-19. Even if you can't catch all

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,200
possible contacts, what you need is to catch enough so that the spread of coronavirus shifts

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,520
from growing exponentially to shrinking exponentially. For those of you who know what

58
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,920
this means, what we need is for R to drop below one. The author of the post that this video is an

59
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,520
adaptation of is a friend of mine, Nicky Case, who is a brilliant programmer and artist. He often makes

60
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,800
these interactive explanations of societally important ideas, including a new one all about

61
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,080
what happens next with COVID-19. So I would highly recommend taking a look at his work if you get the

62
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
chance. He kindly made this post public domain and moreover helped me in putting together this video.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,480
Any reasonable plan for reopening the economy without causing a second wave in the virus

64
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,200
will include some kind of contact tracing. And given how counterintuitive the privacy protection

65
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,160
here can be, I wanted to do all that I could to help amplify this message. If you agree,

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,000
please do share either Nicky's original post or this video adaptation of it.

67
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,720
And since the time that Nicky posted that, Apple and Google have put out press releases about their

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,680
own interoperable contact tracing systems. And I'll tell you, I'm one of those people who

69
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,240
aggressively turns off location tracking as much as I can on my phone, no matter how annoying the

70
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,600
apps can be about asking. I'm looking at you, Fitbit. But I am 100% on board with these apps,

71
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,000
because it's not tracking your location or anything like that. And if you're a nerd like

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
me who wants to dig into the cryptography a bit, I would recommend looking at the white paper and

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,920
the code for the VP3T algorithm, for which I've left links in the description. And as a final

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,960
note, among the many unfortunate consequences of the lockdowns is a spike in calls to mental health

75
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,240
services, like the suicide prevention hotline. If somebody that you know is at risk of suicide,

76
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,400
give them a call, make sure they're doing okay. And if you're at risk, take a look at the resources

77
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
in the description. And if it's an option, reach out to the people in your life to talk about what

78
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,000
you're going through.
