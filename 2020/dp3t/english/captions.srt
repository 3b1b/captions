1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,666
The safest way to reopen the economy soon without causing a second 

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,060
wave in the virus will involve some notion of contact tracing.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,380
But there's a common misconception that this requires tracking people's locations.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,128
A friend of mine, Nikki Case, recently wrote up a post explaining why contact 

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:20,480
tracing is needed, and importantly, how the privacy-protecting variants of it work.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,963
This was done in collaboration with the epidemiologist 

7
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:26,920
Marcel Salathe and security researcher Carmela Trancoso.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,200
What follows is a video adaptation of that post.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,780
As far as COVID-19 cares, there are only three kinds of people.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,998
Not infected yet, infected and contagious but with no symptoms, 

11
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,700
and infected, contagious and showing symptoms.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,936
If you have widespread testing, you can get people 

13
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:50,260
to self-isolate as soon as they show symptoms.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,712
The problem is that the virus still spreads because of all the 

15
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,920
contacts that happened while people are contagious but asymptomatic.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,236
However, if when someone shows symptoms and tests positive, you isolate not only them, 

17
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:06,760
but everyone they've been in contact with, you're staying one step ahead of the virus.

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,165
The old-school way to do this is with interviews, but that's slow, 

19
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:15,180
it's inefficient, and frankly it's quite the intrusion on people's privacy.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,149
Another approach in the modern world would be to ask people who've 

21
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,817
tested positive to forfeit all the geolocation information from their phones, 

22
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,920
and then to track down the people who've been in those same spots.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,047
But now we're well into big brother territory, 

24
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,560
so do we have to sacrifice privacy for health?

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,080
Well, I'll just let Nicky's illustration speak for itself here.

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,196
There are several clever algorithms that let you alert everybody 

27
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:43,243
who's recently been in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, 

28
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:46,240
but without compromising the privacy of anybody involved.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,380
Side note here, I found this very surprising.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,612
I know it shouldn't have been, since I've gone through this dance many times 

31
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:57,237
of thinking something's impossible only to see that cryptography makes it 

32
00:01:57,237 --> 00:02:00,862
actually possible, but I would not blame anybody at all for assuming that 

33
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:04,634
downloading an app that can alert everybody you've been in contact with must 

34
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:08,699
necessarily be tracking and revealing your location and a lot of other information.

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,149
The code for these apps is entirely open, so you don't have to trust me or whoever 

36
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:19,050
wrote the app or Nicky or anyone to believe it's doing what it really claims to be doing.

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,070
Anyway, back to the post.

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,990
Let's see how this works with the help of Alice and Bob.

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,010
Alice gets a tracing app.

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,271
Every five minutes her phone sends out some uniquely 

41
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,810
pseudo-random gibberish to all the nearby devices using Bluetooth.

42
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,094
Because these messages are pseudo-random, they don't use GPS and contain 

43
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:43,050
no information about Alice's identity, not her location, not anything.

44
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,510
It really is gibberish, but the key point is that this gibberish is unique.

45
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,010
Now, while her phone sends out messages, it also listens for messages from nearby phones.

46
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
For example, Bob's.

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,250
Bob also has a privacy-first tracing app that's compatible with, or the same, as Alice's.

48
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,271
If Alice and Bob stay close to each other for more than five minutes, 

49
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:08,610
their phones will exchange respective strings of unique gibberish.

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,932
Both of these phones remember all of the messages 

51
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:14,510
that they said and heard over the last 14 days.

52
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,990
Again, because the random messages contain no information, 

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,170
Alice's privacy is protected from Bob and vice versa.

54
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,210
The next day, Alice develops a dry cough and a fever.

55
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,690
Alice gets tested.

56
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,370
Alice has COVID-19.

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,310
This is not a good day for Alice.

58
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,270
But she won't suffer in vain.

59
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,982
Alice tells her app to upload all of the random gibberish 

60
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:41,250
messages that it's been sending out to a hospital database.

61
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,350
And to do this, she uses a one-time passcode given to her by her doctor.

62
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,110
This code is to prevent spam.

63
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,092
The database then stores Alice's gibberish, and again, 

64
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:54,976
the random messages give no information about Alice, where she was, 

65
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:59,090
who she was with, what she was doing, or even how many people Alice met.

66
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,370
It really is meaningless to the hospital.

67
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,810
But it's not meaningless to Bob's phone.

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,256
Bob's phone often checks this hospital list of random 

69
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:10,250
messages that have come in from COVID-19 positive cases.

70
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,650
Essentially, the hospital's database is saying to all the phones out there, 

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,790
hey, we just got this new random gibberish.

72
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,095
If you've seen that same random gibberish sometime in the last 14 days, 

73
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:25,690
it means you've been in contact with someone who just tested positive for COVID-19.

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,291
Once Bob's phone recognizes some of these numbers that are the gibberish snippets now 

75
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,630
known to be associated with positive test cases, it can warn Bob to self quarantine.

76
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,710
And so Bob cuts off the chain of transmissions.

77
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,750
We're staying one step ahead of the virus.

78
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:41,990
And that's it.

79
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,408
That's how digital contact tracing apps can proactively 

80
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:49,110
prevent the spread of COVID-19 while also protecting our rights.

81
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,570
Thanks, Alice and Bob.

82
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,770
Stay safe.

83
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,450
One important thing to realize is that you don't need everyone to have these apps.

84
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,250
Estimates have it that about 60% would do the trick for COVID-19.

85
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,364
Even if you can't catch all possible contacts, 

86
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:13,908
what you need is to catch enough so that the spread of coronavirus shifts from growing 

87
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:16,050
exponentially to shrinking exponentially.

88
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,690
For those of you who know what this means, what we need is for R to drop below one.

89
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,111
The author of the post that this video is an adaptation of is a friend of mine, 

90
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,710
Nikki Case, who is a brilliant programmer and artist.

91
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,224
He often makes these interactive explanations of societally important ideas, 

92
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,650
including a new one all about what happens next with COVID-19.

93
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,490
So I would highly recommend taking a look at his work if you get the chance.

94
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,290
He kindly made this post public domain and moreover 

95
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,230
helped me in putting together this video.

96
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,226
Any reasonable plan for reopening the economy without causing a 

97
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:52,530
second wave in the virus will include some kind of contact tracing.

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,044
And given how counterintuitive the privacy protection here can be, 

99
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,790
I wanted to do all that I could to help amplify this message.

100
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,290
If you agree, please do share either Nikki's original post or this video adaptation of it.

101
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,833
And since the time that Nikki posted that, Apple and Google have put 

102
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,990
out press releases about their own interoperable contact tracing systems.

103
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,670
And I'll tell you, I'm one of those people who aggressively turns off location tracking 

104
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,510
as much as I can on my phone, no matter how annoying the apps can be about asking.

105
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,850
I'm looking at you, Fitbit.

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,111
But I'm 100% on board with these apps, because it's 

107
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,790
not tracking your location or anything like that.

108
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,516
And if you're a nerd like me who wants to dig into the cryptography a bit, 

109
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:34,153
I would recommend looking at the white paper and the code for the DP3T algorithm, 

110
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,150
for which I've left links in the description.

111
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,244
And as a final note, among the many unfortunate consequences of the lockdowns is 

112
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:45,190
a spike in calls to mental health services, like the suicide prevention hotline.

113
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,866
If somebody that you know is at risk of suicide, 

114
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,030
give them a call, make sure they're doing okay.

115
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,110
And if you're at risk, take a look at the resources in the description.

116
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,100
And if it's an option, reach out to the people in 

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,710
your life to talk about what you're going through.
