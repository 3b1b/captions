  491.54

  "Pretty interesting.",

  634.28
 ],
 [
  "We're going to explain it in a moment.",
  634.66,
  635.78
 ],
 [
  "So the correct expression, which looks like 3,000 of you got, is that it should be $100 times 1 plus 0.6 squared.",
  636.56,
  645.08
 ],
 [
  "Alright?",
  645.88,
  646.06
 ],
 [
  "Now let's think through why that might be the case.",
  646.6,
  648.1
 ],
 [
  "So if we head back over to our Desmos expression that we were working with, If instead of increasing by 12%, we're saying increase by 6%, when you factor it out, it looks like multiplying by 1.06.",
  648.3,
  662.3
 ],
 [
  "And then there's two ways you can think about this.",
  663.68,
  665.56
 ],
 [
  "If you're already comfortable with the idea that increasing by 6% is multiplying by this constant, you say, oh, we just square that.",
  665.6,
  671.28
 ],
 [
  "And if you want to think through the details for why that's true, if that's not something you're entirely comfortable with, you can say, let's repeat the process.",
  672.14,
  678.58
 ],
 [
  "So this gets us 106 after that first six month period.",
  678.58,
  681.92
 ],
 [
  "Okay, we've got 106, then we're going to add 6%, 0.06 times that 106, and that's going to get us the final amount.",
  682.18,
  690.82
 ],
 [
  "But this we can factor, because the 106 shows up in two places.",
  691.22,
  694.74
 ],
 [
  "Because the rate of growth is proportional to itself, it lets us factor this out as 106 times 1.06.",
  694.86,
  702.52
 ],
 [
  "And then you might realize, oh wait, I'm just multiplying by the same constant that I did before.",
  703.36,
  707.18
 ],
 [
  "So I might as well have just gone and put that constant up there.",
  707.18,
  710.28
 ],
 [
  "And because it's the same constant, I might as well have simply written that as a square.",
  710.66,
  715.04
 ],
 [
  "So what that means is if you take these steps of percent increases many, many different times, what it looks like is taking a number that's a little above 1 and then raising it to some kind of power.",
  717.06,
  726.54
 ],
 [
  "So to our original question, asking about bank B, which, what did it say?",
  726.98,
  731.48
 ],
 [
  "It was going to be a 1% increase to your savings every month.",
  731.54,
  734.88

 [
  "The way you might think about that is by saying we multiply by 1.01, okay, by 1 plus that 1%, and then we do it after 12 months.",
  734.88,
  745.84
 ],
 [
  "Okay, so instead of the, instead of the $112 that you would have had from bank A, woo hoo!",
  746.48,
  754.3
 ],
 [
  "It looks like compounding more frequently got us an extra 68 cents in our account.",
  754.46,
  759.18
 ],
 [
  "So, wonderful, right?",
  759.38,
  761.56
 ],
 [
  "In our graph, if we wanted to see what that would look like, again, there's some machinery under here that I'll show in a moment, but if I just crank up this number n to 12, that's basically asking how many times per year do I compound this interest?",
  761.56,
  777.52
 ],
 [
  "Do I make a little step increase based on what the annual interest rate is?",
  777.8,
  781.64
 ],
 [
  "So if the annual interest rate was 12% and you're making steps each 1 12th of a month, that means you increase by 1% each one of those.",
  781.84,
  790.7
 ],
 [
  "So what it looks like is a step function that's a lot more fine, okay?",
  790.7,
  795.04

  803.3
 ],
 [
  "Not quite a dollar more, but it is more.",
  803.66,
  805.54

 [

  806.26,
  812.36
 ],
 [
  "And if you're curious, you know, previously after 10 years, we would have had $310, I think it was, which we can verify for ourselves if I take that $100 times 1 plus 0.12 to the 10th.",

 [
  "So, not bad.",
  836.2,
  837.64

  883.84,
  893.52

 [
  "Because intuitively we know that the spring is pulling back with some kind of force.",

  3294.74

  3343.9,
  3369.36

  3410.88

  "But if that all feels weird, hopefully it feels more concrete when you realize all that saying is that the position of the spring oscillates back and forth in a nice little cosine wave, which matches physical intuition, it kind of oscillates back and forth in this gentle smooth wave.",
  3411.5,
  3426.88

  3440.1
 ],
 [
  "So it's going to start off at zero, but then it's going to go down, basically because it started off, you know, as far as it could be, and then it's going to point in the opposite direction, bringing the mass back towards equilibrium.",
  3442.38,
  3452.76

  3477.2
