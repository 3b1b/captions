00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,354
Welcome back to Lockdown Math, where we try to answer some of the important 

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:09,340
questions in life, some of the deeper things that are relevant, push your life forward.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,592
Like for example, what if you have a bank that offers 

4
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:15,260
you an interest rate of the square root of negative one?

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,143
A negative, not even a negative interest rate, 

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,160
we thought that was weird enough, an imaginary interest rate.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,580
Should you take it?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,588
Now I almost guarantee, however interesting you think this question is, 

9
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,660
it's going to be more interesting than that.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,055
I think there's going to be some people who find it totally nonsensical, 

11
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:34,400
right, which is reasonable.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,720
What on earth would it mean for your money to grow by the square root of negative one?

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,113
And I think there's also some people who think they know where this lesson is going, 

14
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:46,160
but wherever you sit, I almost guarantee this is going to be more interesting than you 

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,440
think.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,844
And to start things off, let me bring back our poll that we were doing, 

17
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:54,588
you know, during the warm-up animations, and I just want to get a sense 

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,020
for what your instinct is on this apparently nonsensical question.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,113
Okay, so obviously there's no right or wrong answer here, 

20
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,993
it's something that we're going to answer by the end, 

21
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:07,140
but I'm genuinely curious what you viewing right now think.

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,051
If a bank offers you an annual interest rate of the square root of negative one, 

23
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:12,880
do you take it?

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,382
So if you want to participate either in this poll or any of 

25
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:19,393
the live quizzing that we do throughout, obviously 3b1b.co 

26
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:22,660
slash live is where you can go, link in the description as well.

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,960
And while you're answering this, I just want to mention that even if this is 

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,261
kind of a nonsensical question for money, one of the things I'd like to show 

29
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,674
by the end is that thinking through the details of this question is shockingly 

30
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:39,640
relevant to physics, okay, and to understanding simple harmonic motion.

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,482
So even if it feels like nonsense, if you're willing to engage with the 

32
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:47,320
weird storyline for a bit, there is a satisfying real-world endpoint for that.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,380
The other thing I want to mention is a brief plug for a video by Mathologer.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,900
If you guys don't know Mathologer, you're certainly in for a treat.

35
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,658
But he did this one called E to the Pi I for Dummies, 

36
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,680
and in general the channel is just full of gems.

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,426
But this video in particular contains a lot of the things that 

38
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,740
I want to talk about today, and it's just so beautifully done.

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,740
It's extremely well presented, extremely approachable.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,654
Burkhard who presents it is extremely lovable, 

41
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:18,660
so could not recommend that and other things highly enough.

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,246
Good thing to watch maybe right after this, or even if you're 

43
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:24,000
watching this in the future, you know, to watch right before this.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,460
So looking back at our poll, fascinating!

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,860
We've got a very even split between the yeses and the nos.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,938
I wouldn't have guessed that, actually, and I'm curious if by the end of this, 

47
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:40,860
once we see what the implications would be, how many of you would stand by your answers.

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,460
So let me just, let me just see what this distribution is, because I am curious to know.

49
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,018
Alright, so it looks like 1,600 and 1,700 of you said yes, 

50
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:54,340
you would take the imaginary interest rate.

51
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,060
And then 1,645 of you said no.

52
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,942
Alright, we'll see if you stand by that by the end, 

53
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:04,140
and we'll really understand the implications of imaginary interest.

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,500
Now before that, let's ask a question that is a little bit more real world, 

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,920
because I think we should spend the first, I don't know, 

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,240
half hour of the lesson or so on actual normal compound interest, right?

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
The kind of interest that we would all usually think of.

58
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,106
Make sure we can build up some of the math of that, 

59
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:25,700
and then once we have the math of that, see how we can tweak it to answer our, 

60
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,020
well, frankly silly question.

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,387
Okay, so as our first, I don't even want to call it a real question, 

62
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,280
it's still meant as an opinion poll.

63
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,840
Don't necessarily think you have to do the computation.

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,600
What I want to gauge is what your gut reaction to this question is, okay?

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,420
So there is a correct answer, but just answer what you think it might be.

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,160
So the question asks, two banks offer different interest rates on your savings.

67
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,140
Bank A will increase your savings by 12% every year, okay?

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,080
Pretty good bank.

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,980
Bank B will increase your savings by 1% every month.

70
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,300
Again, I wish my bank worked like this.

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,041
With each of these banks, you set up an account with $100, 

72
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,860
and after one year, which of the following is true?

73
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,743
So you have more money with bank A by more than $1, 

74
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:14,680
so the difference between what you have in A and B is greater than $1.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,760
You have more money in bank A but by less than $1.

76
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,023
You have the same amount in each, more in bank B but by less than $1, 

77
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:25,240
or more in bank B by more than $1.

78
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,660
Okay, so it seems like we have pretty strong consensus.

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't know if I would call that strong consensus actually.

80
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,060
There's a clear winner, but there's definitely a lot of contention behind it.

81
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,782
And in general, by the way, while these answers are rolling in, 

82
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:47,240
I'll sometimes be pulling up questions from the audience, which you can ask via Twitter.

83
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,780
So the link is in the description for where you can go to ask these sorts of questions.

84
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:09,085
And it looks like someone with the profile of Yoda asks, What a poetically written tweet, 

85
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:21,160
which seems pretty fitting for someone with a profile of Yoda in there.

86
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,400
I mean, it's a subjective question.

87
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,771
Personally, I do think the most beautiful things 

88
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,960
are the ones that have unexpected connections.

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,220
And I don't know if that's like a natural thing that humans 

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,840
just love to see things that seemed unrelated come together.

91
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,846
Humor seems to have this root, like a really good joke kind of takes you by surprise, 

92
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:41,600
but when there's some kind of logical connection, it's not just surprise for its own sake.

93
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,756
And as the lesson goes on, if you have questions relevant to what we're talking about, 

94
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,840
ask them there and we'll pull them up on screen.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,446
So, like I said, there's technically a right answer to this question, 

96
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,880
but I don't really want it to be treated as right or wrong.

97
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,418
The reason I'm asking this one is to get kind of 

98
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,600
an opinion poll to know where people are starting.

99
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,360
So I'm going to go ahead and lock in the answers and see where people are.

100
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,300
Interesting!

101
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,262
This might be the first time in lockdown math history that the 

102
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:11,980
plurality has not gotten what turns out to be the correct answer.

103
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,833
So most of you said you would have more money 

104
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,240
with bank B and it would be by more than a dollar.

105
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,611
The second most common answer was to say you'd have more money 

106
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:25,440
with bank B by less than a dollar, which turns out to be correct.

107
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,700
We're going to walk through that in a moment.

108
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,840
After that, more with bank A.

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,115
And I think the ones that I most empathize with, 

110
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:37,491
if I look back at what maybe an initial response to questions like this would be, 

111
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,800
if you haven't thought about interest, is everyone who said C.

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,736
You know, it's not obvious that 12% over a year 

113
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,220
is going to be any different than 1% per month.

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
You're like, 1% per month?

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,000
That should add up to 12% over the year.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,100
And I think it's worth just thinking through exactly why that's not the case.

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,160
So, how do we think about this kind of problem?

118
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,080
I've gone ahead and pulled up a Desmos graph for us to play around with.

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,500
So we'll get rid of Burckardt's beautiful face and we'll head on over to Desmos.

120
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,565
And the way I have things configured, it's going to be showing us 

121
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,460
the graph of what happens to your money, in this case in bank A.

122
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,687
So over the first year, at any point that you check in, 

123
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:20,760
it's just got that $100 and it's not until the end of the year that it jumps up to $112.

124
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,922
And the way you might think about that is by saying, okay, 

125
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:28,820
let's take our $100, at the end of the year we add 12% of that $100.

126
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,460
And sensibly enough, you get 112.

127
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,101
And a nice way to think about this, which seems simple and it seems kind of innocuous, 

128
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,920
but this turns out to be a powerful idea.

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,785
We'll talk about more why I might want to emphasize that 

130
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:47,600
this is more of a significant move than you might think.

131
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,520
The fact that the rate of change is proportional to the 

132
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,340
thing that's changing means we can factor out this $100.

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,780
And we can just say, oh, that step that we take, we're multiplying it by a constant.

134
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
In this case, that constant would be 1.12.

135
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,015
So as you go from this step to the second year, at the end of that second year, 

136
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:07,303
your account balance doesn't jump by just $12, 

137
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:11,540
because it's also earning interest on the 12 extra dollars that you got that last year.

138
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,400
So it jumps up to $125.

139
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
It's a multiplicative amount.

140
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,664
And this becomes particularly noticeable as we zoom out and see what would happen 

141
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:25,140
over the course of many years with such a fantastic interest rate in your bank.

142
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,080
It's not just growing like a straight line, it grows with this exponential curve.

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,312
And in fact, if you look at 10 years in, it looks 

144
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,700
like the Y coordinate of that is around 310.

145
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,594
So you let your money sit in that savings account with 12% interest for 10 years, 

146
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:43,460
and you'd end up with three times as much money.

147
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,400
Pretty interesting.

148
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,357
So now when we start thinking about having the interest accrue, 

149
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:53,402
not just at the end of the year, but at various chunks on the way in, 

150
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,540
let me just ask you another question.

151
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,078
I think this is a fun way to start things off, 

152
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,480
is rather than having me go through the logic, have you guys think through the details.

153
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:06,621
So before we jump to the case of doing a step every month, 

154
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:10,060
let's just say there was two steps halfway through the year.

155
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
So what does the question ask us?

156
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,164
It says a bank offers to increase the money in your 

157
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,920
savings account by 6% at the end of every six months.

158
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,100
Which of the following represents how much money will be in 

159
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,460
your account if you put in $100 and then you wait for one year?

160
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,540
So there's two different six month periods that have passed.

161
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,080
Which of the following expressions shows how much you're going to have?

162
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,220
So I'm going to give you a moment to think through the details of this.

163
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,460
Give you a little pause and ponder music maybe.

164
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,173
Okay, as always, I'm probably going to grade this faster than is a reasonable 

165
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:21,360
amount of time for someone who really wants to think through the details of things.

166
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,980
So never feel like you're being rushed.

167
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,820
Sometimes it's just that I want to move forward with the lesson.

168
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,100
And it seems like answers are rolling in a little bit more slowly now.

169
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,358
So I'm going to go ahead and lock this in, but as always, 

170
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:34,280
feel free to pause and just think things through more yourself if you want.

171
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,780
We're going to explain it in a moment.

172
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,234
So the correct expression, which looks like 3,000 of you got, 

173
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:45,080
is that it should be $100 times 1 plus 0.6 squared.

174
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,060
Alright?

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,100
Now let's think through why that might be the case.

176
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,728
So if we head back over to our Desmos expression that we were working with, 

177
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:58,157
If instead of increasing by 12%, we're saying increase by 6%, 

178
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,300
when you factor it out, it looks like multiplying by 1.06.

179
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,560
And then there's two ways you can think about this.

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,440
If you're already comfortable with the idea that increasing by 6% 

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,280
is multiplying by this constant, you say, oh, we just square that.

182
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,763
And if you want to think through the details for why that's true, 

183
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:17,586
if that's not something you're entirely comfortable with, you can say, 

184
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,580
let's repeat the process.

185
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,920
So this gets us 106 after that first six month period.

186
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,893
Okay, we've got 106, then we're going to add 6%, 

187
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:30,820
0.06 times that 106, and that's going to get us the final amount.

188
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,740
But this we can factor, because the 106 shows up in two places.

189
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,038
Because the rate of growth is proportional to itself, 

190
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:42,520
it lets us factor this out as 106 times 1.06.

191
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,171
And then you might realize, oh wait, I'm just 

192
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,180
multiplying by the same constant that I did before.

193
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,280
So I might as well have just gone and put that constant up there.

194
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,040
And because it's the same constant, I might as well have simply written that as a square.

195
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,537
So what that means is if you take these steps of percent increases many, 

196
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,729
many different times, what it looks like is taking a number that's 

197
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:06,540
a little above 1 and then raising it to some kind of power.

198
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,480
So to our original question, asking about bank B, which, what did it say?

199
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,880
It was going to be a 1% increase to your savings every month.

200
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,788
The way you might think about that is by saying we multiply by 1.01, 

201
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:25,840
okay, by 1 plus that 1%, and then we do it after 12 months.

202
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,300
Okay, so instead of the, instead of the $112 that you would have had from bank A, woo hoo!

203
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,180
It looks like compounding more frequently got us an extra 68 cents in our account.

204
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,560
So, wonderful, right?

205
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,901
In our graph, if we wanted to see what that would look like, again, 

206
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:49,859
there's some machinery under here that I'll show in a moment, 

207
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:55,157
but if I just crank up this number n to 12, that's basically asking how many times 

208
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:57,520
per year do I compound this interest?

209
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,640
Do I make a little step increase based on what the annual interest rate is?

210
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,549
So if the annual interest rate was 12% and you're making steps each 1 12th of a month, 

211
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:10,700
that means you increase by 1% each one of those.

212
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,040
So what it looks like is a step function that's a lot more fine, okay?

213
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,762
And we can see how at the end of the one year, 

214
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:23,300
the y coordinate of our graph is that $112 with the extra 68 cents.

215
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,540
Not quite a dollar more, but it is more.

216
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,751
And again, as we zoom out, you can see that it fits this nice exponential curve, 

217
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,360
the power of compound growth.

218
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,925
And if you're curious, you know, previously after 10 years, 

219
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:41,490
we would have had $310, I think it was, which we can verify 

220
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,360
for ourselves if I take that $100 times 1 plus 0.12 to the 10th.

221
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
Alright, this says $310.

222
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,649
When we compound every month instead, and we wait for 120 months, 

223
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,980
it looks like we've squeezed out an extra 20 bucks.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,640
So, not bad.

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,223
The important part here though, is the idea that the frequency with 

226
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:04,860
which you compound actually changes the amount, which is interesting.

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,103
And this is the original circle of thoughts that Bernoulli was thinking about 

228
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:14,680
that leads to the origins of the constant e that we all now know and love.

229
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,440
Maybe the second most famous constant only next to pi.

230
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,423
So let's write out some of what we're doing here, but with some formulas, 

231
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:24,420
and then see what we can start learning with respect to those formulas.

232
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,807
And this is going to help us understand the bizarre question of an 

233
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:32,306
interest rate of negative, not even negative, I keep saying interest rate of negative 1, 

234
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,480
interest rate of square root of negative 1.

235
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,880
Nobody should let the Fed watch this video, I think it might introduce some shaky ideas.

236
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,961
Alright, so the way we might think about this is let's say you start 

237
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:50,037
off with some amount of money, okay, and then we're going to let it 

238
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,520
accrue some interest over some long amount of time, that I'm going to call t.

239
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,903
And the idea is that we're chopping this amount of time into a bunch of little pieces, 

240
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:03,420
okay, and with each one of these steps we're going to increase our money.

241
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
There's going to be some kind of change to m, a delta m.

242
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,680
And each of these steps, let's say it's got a length of delta t.

243
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,148
So maybe delta t is a 12th of a year, or maybe it's 1 365th of a year, 

244
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,460
it depends on how finely we cut it.

245
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,212
And just as another variable to throw down here, 

246
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,582
let's keep track of how many steps there are along the way, 

247
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,380
if we were to count them all up.

248
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,132
And the total number would be the total amount of time 

249
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:33,980
divided by the size of the time steps that we're taking, okay?

250
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,057
So what interest rates do is they say that the amount your money 

251
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:42,267
changes is going to equal that interest rate, r, 

252
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:47,180
and you might think of r as being something like the 0.12 from our example.

253
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,320
And then later on we're going to play around with making it imaginary.

254
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,911
But you're going to multiply it by the size of your time step, okay, 

255
00:15:55,911 --> 00:16:00,780
which you might think of as being something like 1.12 if we were compounding monthly.

256
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,003
Because simply by compounding monthly it doesn't mean you get to grow by 12% every month, 

257
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:09,540
it means you grow by 1.12 of what the annual rate was every month.

258
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,946
And then what makes compound growth so powerful, 

259
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:15,840
it's also proportional to the amount of money you had.

260
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,483
You know, if you had $100 it grows by a certain amount, 

261
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,080
if you had $1000 in there it grows by 10 times as much.

262
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,000
The more you have, the more it grows.

263
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,520
Okay, so that in our example you might think of as being something like $100.

264
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,140
Alright, so what's the magic of this?

265
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,410
It looks innocuous at first, but it means that our 

266
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,180
money changes by going to m plus r delta t times m.

267
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:46,631
And because m shows up in both of these terms, it lets us factor things out, 

268
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,560
so that m factors out and we have 1 plus r delta t.

269
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,391
And because this is the same constant that we're going to multiply for each 

270
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:59,240
one of these little time steps, all you're doing is multiplying by this constant.

271
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,160
We can write an expression for how much money you're going to have after time t.

272
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,774
What it's going to look like is the amount of money you had to start off 

273
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:14,720
with at time t equals 0 multiplied by this expression, 1 plus r delta t.

274
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,740
And I'll change this in a moment, but I'll keep writing it as r delta t.

275
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,560
But we multiply it by itself n times, where n is the number of steps that we have in here.

276
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,573
Okay, but there's a lot of different variables at play here, 

277
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,040
so I want to start consolidating them.

278
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,298
And instead of writing delta t, I'm going to go ahead 

279
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,320
and express delta t as the total time divided by n.

280
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,451
We look at the number of chunks we've cut our period into, 

281
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:44,860
and we take the total amount of time and divide by that.

282
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,971
So what our expression will look like is the amount of money we 

283
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:56,000
started with times 1 plus r times the total time divided by n.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,420
So this t divided by n is playing the role of delta t.

285
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,140
And we raise that to the nth power.

286
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,257
Now this is actually a very interesting expression, no pun intended, 

287
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:11,280
because we want to know how does the size of n influence things.

288
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,940
If I crank up n a lot, meaning we're chopping our interval into very fine 

289
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,640
increments and compounding very frequently, what does that mean for our interest?

290
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:23,152
And you might, if you were a pure mathematician, 

291
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:28,528
try to abstract away all the ideas of the money here, the specific interest rate, 

292
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:33,511
and just say what we're interested in is this function of x that looks like 

293
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,560
1 plus 1 over n.

294
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,260
Or maybe I'll say 1 plus x over n.

295
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,420
So we want to be able to plug in some value for r t.

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
And we'll raise that to the power n.

297
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,040
But you're not just curious about this for any particular n.

298
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,280
What you want to know is what happens as you crank up the value of n.

299
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,333
And the expression that mathematicians write for this, we write lim for limit, 

300
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,066
and then we write n with an arrow to infinity, 

301
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:03,660
saying I want to crank up that n and see what happens to this particular value.

302
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,197
Now it's not obvious, I think, what happens to it, 

303
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:12,469
and playing with my toy again, I just want to do another half-opinion poll, 

304
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:16,840
half-real question about this one to see what your instinct is.

305
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,359
So let's say, pull up the question here, what happens to the value 100 

306
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:32,620
times 1 plus 0.12 over n to the power n as the value of n approaches infinity?

307
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,020
And in the back of your mind, you can think this isn't just a purely mathematical 

308
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,680
expression, it has a very real meaning in the context of compound interest.

309
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,237
What we're basically saying is if you have that 12% interest rate, 

310
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:51,081
and you want to wait one year, but you chop up that year into n different pieces, 

311
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:56,103
maybe n is 12 if you compound every month, maybe n is 365 if you compound every day, 

312
00:19:56,103 --> 00:20:00,120
or maybe you want to compound every microsecond or every picosecond.

313
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,461
The question is, how much money can you get at the 

314
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,940
end of the year simply by compounding more frequently?

315
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,960
If you'll remember, when we went from yearly to monthly, that gave us an extra 68 cents.

316
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,080
So the question asks, basically, how high can this go?

317
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,980
And now we have a very wide split, which is wonderful.

318
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,240
I'm going to give you guys a couple more moments to think about this.

319
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,691
And I don't want you to calculate it necessarily, 

320
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:30,352
the spirit of this question is to see what your initial thought is, 

321
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,560
kind of intuitively based on the numbers.

322
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,532
So even though technically there's a right answer to this one, 

323
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,980
so I'll highlight it green, there's no right or wrong here.

324
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,680
The spirit of it is for me to know where people are.

325
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,640
I'll give you just a little bit of time on this.

326
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,240
And while I do, let's take a question from the audience.

327
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,919
Considering that imaginary unit is defined in terms of operations on the real numbers, 

328
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,760
is there an analogous definition of quaternions in terms of operations on complex numbers?

329
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,500
Okay, so a bit of an advanced question.

330
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,660
I don't expect most people watching the series to necessarily know what quaternions are.

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,054
But it's a number system that instead of including two dimensions, 

332
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:21,380
like the complex numbers, involves four dimensions.

333
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,580
The short answer to the question, I think this is okay to say, the short answer is no.

334
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,404
When we get the complex numbers it's because we 

335
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:32,880
have an expression that we don't have a solution to.

336
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,600
You want to know the square root of negative one.

337
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,060
A solution to x squared equals negative one.

338
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,420
And by introducing a solution, you extend your number system.

339
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,440
Quaternions don't come about like that.

340
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,626
For any polynomial, once you have the complex numbers, 

341
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:48,540
you get all the solutions that you could ever want from that.

342
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,356
So it's not going to be there's a problem that you wanted solved 

343
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:54,000
in the sense of a solution to a polynomial and you extend it.

344
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,700
But where it does come from is the idea, at least historically, 

345
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,820
is the idea of wanting to describe motion in three dimensions.

346
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,621
And complex numbers can describe things like rotation in two dimensions, 

347
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:10,300
but they don't have enough degrees of freedom to describe rotations in three dimensions.

348
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,340
So in that sense it was a concrete problem they couldn't solve.

349
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,792
But the construct that you do to add on top of 

350
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,460
it doesn't look like a solution to a polynomial.

351
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,783
Kind of a more advanced question than the spirit of the lessons necessarily, 

352
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:27,780
but obviously I love to just engage with wherever you are, whoever is watching this.

353
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,380
So back to our question.

354
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,080
I'll go ahead and grade it.

355
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,780
And again, technically there's a right answer, but don't view this as right or wrong.

356
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:42,187
It looks like 1670 of you correctly noted that this value would rise above 112, 

357
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,040
but never above 113.

358
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,646
So maybe taking the instincts from the fact that when we went from yearly to 

359
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:52,640
monthly we only got 68 cents and saying you can't get much better than that.

360
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,026
The next biggest answer, interesting, was people who said it would rise above 114, 

361
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:01,120
but stay below some finite bound.

362
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,840
Okay, so having that instinct that it would stay finite, 

363
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,800
but that it was going to get bigger than anything listed here.

364
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,240
And I think the most thought-provoking answer here is E.

365
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,580
The thought that maybe it should blow up to infinity.

366
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,260
I mean, we're letting n get as big as we want.

367
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,220
It doesn't just have to be down to the picosecond, it could be down to a plank length.

368
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,471
It could be down to the tiniest, the biggest number that you could think of, 

369
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,600
so that our time steps are as tiny as you can think.

370
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,660
It's not at all obvious that this thing would remain bounded.

371
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,740
So we can play around with this a little bit if we want to.

372
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,027
This won't be a proof that it remains bounded, 

373
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:40,060
but maybe it can give us a little bit of an instinct in that direction.

374
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,042
If I take 1 plus 0.12 over n, and I raise this to the power n, 

375
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:49,600
and I say what happens as we increase n?

376
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
And 100, that's not big enough.

377
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,500
I want to let myself increase it to some huge number, you know, 100 million.

378
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,300
So the value I want you to watch is sitting right here, okay?

379
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,218
And remember that represents how much money you'll have 

380
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:06,380
if you compound your 12% interest much more frequently.

381
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,840
Even as I'm cranking it up around 100 million, this value really stays stable around 1.12.

382
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,100
Here, let's multiply it by the $100 to make it more intuitive.

383
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,532
Around the $112.74, about 75 cents, it stays really 

384
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:25,880
stable around that even as I'm increasing by a lot.

385
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,200
That's not a proof.

386
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,688
For all we know, as you venture into the realm of huge, huge numbers, 

387
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:35,501
10 to the 300th, or grams constant, or whatever big number you want, 

388
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:39,260
maybe this thing would slowly crawl up and eventually get unbounded.

389
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
But it's an interesting fact that it doesn't.

390
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,380
Now, in terms of the math behind this, we can do an interesting manipulation.

391
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,360
Because we have this expression that is a little funky to think about, right?

392
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,982
We've got 1 plus x over n that you might think of as a partial interest rate, 

393
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:57,760
and we're raising it to the n.

394
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:06,400
I can do a little substitution and say, what if I define the value m to be n divided by x?

395
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:12,520
And the reason for doing that would be so that I can write that inside without an x in it.

396
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,780
So x divided by n will be the same as 1 divided by m.

397
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,235
And now I'll be raising that to the power, well not n, 

398
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:23,600
well no, the power n, but I want to write it in terms of m.

399
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,700
So it'll look like m times x.

400
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,555
And based on how exponents work, I can think of that just as 

401
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:35,600
the quantity 1 plus 1 over m to the power n all raised to the x.

402
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,880
And I'm curious about what happens here as I crank the value of m towards infinity.

403
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,588
And Bernoulli was also interested in what happens 

404
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,920
as we crank this value of m up towards infinity.

405
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,973
And empirically, what you'll find is if you just play around with this, 

406
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:56,991
and if we go over and take out the evidence that we were dealing with a real world 

407
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,767
problem, with things like that $100 starting value, or that 12% interest rate, 

408
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:05,273
and we just have clean constants like 1 for each of them, 

409
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:08,720
it looks like this value ends up to being around 2.71828.

410
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,120
And no matter how big you make n, it seems to never really get much different than that.

411
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,310
Again, not a proof, but very suggestive that this 

412
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,620
is maybe a fundamental constant of nature.

413
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,187
And so this is the original definition of e, this is 

414
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:26,020
the original way that people were thinking about it.

415
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,961
As we pop over here, and we say instead of writing this whole limit expression, 

416
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:36,168
I'll use a different color, say in principle, this is going to approach some kind of 

417
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:36,720
constant.

418
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,720
Let's call this constant e that empirically has a value around 2.71828.

419
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,160
And then we can write our whole thing as e to the x.

420
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,965
So for example, if we wanted to know what happens in our interest example, 

421
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:59,053
when we started out with $0, not $0, started out with m of 0, 

422
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:04,394
which might be something like $100, what we do is we just focus on that rt term, 

423
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:10,065
we say we know that as we crank up n, this is going to approach some special constant 

424
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:11,780
raised to the power of rt.

425
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,544
And maybe this we would aptly describe as continuously compounded growth, 

426
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:19,400
if we take that time step and we let it approach 0.

427
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,960
And this was actually before Newton and Leibniz, this was before calculus existed.

428
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,825
There was this idea of trying to take these discrete steps of increasing 

429
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:31,480
and make it approach 0 to get something a little bit more continuous.

430
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,920
So I think that's quite cool.

431
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:41,862
And one thing that you might notice here is we've got this large expression 

432
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:47,760
for basically a function of x that we now tend to write as e to the x.

433
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,375
If you watched the last lecture, you would have remembered that I said 

434
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,041
the way things have come about in math now, whenever we see e to the x, 

435
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,300
we actually think of it as a shorthand for a certain polynomial.

436
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,707
And the polynomial, I was calling it exp, which follows convention, 

437
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:08,031
looks like 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6, 

438
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:14,140
and all of the terms look like x to the k divided by k factorial for some whole number k.

439
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,553
And I said this is what e to the x is a shorthand for, this is how you think about it, 

440
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:22,460
especially when there's weird inputs, things like an imaginary interest rate.

441
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,833
And you might wonder, what on earth does this 

442
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,720
polynomial have to do with this limiting expression?

443
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,028
And as a super extra credit challenge question for those of you who are really 

444
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:37,784
into algebra and who are very comfortable with binomial expansion, 

445
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:42,157
if you know what those terms mean, if you take this expression for some large 

446
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:46,585
value of n and you expand it, you just expand it and you kind of simplify your 

447
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:51,182
terms and then you make approximations based on what's true when n is very large, 

448
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:55,723
what you would find is that the polynomial this expands to looks a lot like this 

449
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:56,620
polynomial here.

450
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,612
And in fact, as this value of n gets bigger and bigger and approaches infinity, 

451
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:06,100
this polynomial will get closer and closer to this one.

452
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,103
It's a challenging question, so I wouldn't expect everyone to necessarily be 

453
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:14,160
able to just bang it out, but if you want to it's a very elucidating exercise.

454
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,842
And there's also a lot of delicacy in rigorously proving the fact that what this 

455
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:23,614
approaches will also approach this, or that both of them even stay finite and they don't 

456
00:29:23,614 --> 00:29:28,224
blow up when you add more and more terms to the sum or when you crank up n higher and 

457
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:28,600
higher.

458
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,891
There's a lot of delicacy there, but you can probably 

459
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:33,120
get to a point where there's an intuitive connection.

460
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,951
And the reason that in math we tend to work with this polynomial instead of that limit, 

461
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:41,300
it's basically easier for computations and easier for theory.

462
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,864
But the value of this other expression is that it ties us back to the idea of compound 

463
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:51,850
interest and the idea of taking a quantity that changes a little bit based on its own 

464
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,140
size.

465
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,175
You can kind of readily read this as saying we're going to multiply 

466
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:59,900
by a certain constant that's a little above one many, many times.

467
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,081
And if you'll remember, the reason we're doing that is when the way that 

468
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:08,262
you change is proportional to yourself, that lets you factor things such 

469
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:12,100
that you're just multiplying by something a little bigger than one.

470
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,250
And when you do this approaching continuity, when you do it in a way where that time step 

471
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,340
is getting smaller and smaller, this is when we start writing e to the power of something.

472
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,160
What it's suggesting is that you have this compound interest expression, 

473
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,620
but we're letting that n tend towards infinity.

474
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
We're letting the time step go as small as we want.

475
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:36,280
So, with all of that said, we can start having fun.

476
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,740
We can start thinking about our original question of an imaginary interest rate.

477
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
So how on earth is this going to work?

478
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,100
First of all, let's just say from the get-go that if we try plugging in r to 

479
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,820
this expression where we're raising a constant e to a power, it makes no sense.

480
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,740
If r is equal to the square root of negative one.

481
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,220
You cannot multiply a constant by itself the square root of negative one times.

482
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,640
So that doesn't make sense.

483
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,281
But what does is if we go to this original expression, 

484
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:12,180
the origins of e, and try to imagine plugging in something like i to that.

485
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,420
We know how to divide i by n, that's fine.

486
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,880
We know how to add it to one, that's fine.

487
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,680
We know how to take a complex number and multiply it by itself.

488
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,680
All of the operations there are quite fine.

489
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,660
Now let's draw it out to think about what it would look like.

490
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:30,200
And the other thing I want to emphasize is I know this seems like utter nonsense.

491
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,640
We're talking about imaginary numbers in the context of interest rates.

492
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,780
But in a couple minutes, I really do hope to make this relevant to physics and 

493
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,580
hope to make you see that this is not a totally nonsensical circle of thoughts.

494
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,099
So, I've got my axes here, where this is going to be my real money, 

495
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:54,640
and this will be all of my imaginary money.

496
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,897
What it means if your interest rate is i, is that the change to the money looks like 

497
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:10,280
i times whatever the time step is, delta t, times whatever the money is to begin with.

498
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,197
Now, in, I believe it was lecture 3, we talked all about complex numbers, 

499
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:19,385
and one of the fundamental facts was that when you multiply i by something, 

500
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:21,700
it has the effect of a 90 degree rotation.

501
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,100
And we talked about this in terms of looking at the coordinates and 

502
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,820
realizing that you just swap the coordinates and make 1 negative 1.

503
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,288
So this connection between the square root of 1 property and the 

504
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:34,520
very mechanistic idea of taking a vector and rotating it 90 degrees.

505
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,757
Now what this means for us is that the change to your money is going to 

506
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:42,112
be a little arrow that, you know, it's not increasing the money, 

507
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:46,655
you're not growing, you're not decreasing the money, it's not a negative interest rate, 

508
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:49,960
it's moving somehow perpendicular to where the money already is.

509
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,540
So after a little step in time, you end up with a little bit of imaginary money.

510
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,120
So you have what you had originally and you can play Monopoly.

511
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,460
And now from that point, when you do another time step, it does the same thing.

512
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,487
It takes the vector that you've newly landed on and it rotates it 90 degrees, 

513
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,840
okay, and then you take a little step based on that.

514
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,600
And then again, you take a little step based on that.

515
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,507
Where at each point you're looking at what is your money number that has some real part 

516
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:25,040
and some imaginary part, you rotate it 90 degrees and you add a little step on that.

517
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,720
And now the question is what happens to this?

518
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,400
This is the original question.

519
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,720
The bank offers you this interest rate, what's it going to do?

520
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,959
The correct answer, I think, is that you need to ask the bank for more 

521
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:42,860
information because how frequently you compound it is going to make a difference.

522
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,914
So to illustrate this, let's say you compounded it annually, 

523
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:51,505
meaning at the end of every year you take a big step that's based on this interest 

524
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:52,280
rate multiple.

525
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,708
So for every dollar that you have, if you started out just putting 

526
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:02,591
your real money into the bank, at the end of the year you would add i times that amount, 

527
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:05,500
which is a 90 degree rotation of your money.

528
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,940
Again, I know this is utter nonsense, but follow along with me.

529
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,719
One, it's fun, and two, it leads to real physics.

530
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,760
So where does that get you?

531
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,880
Well, it gets you $1 plus i dollars.

532
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,689
So if you had $100 in the bank, you end up with 

533
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:22,060
$100 real dollars and $100 imaginary dollars.

534
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,402
But then, after the next year, you take another step, 

535
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:28,636
where it takes that new money vector, rotates it 90 degrees, 

536
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,280
and adds that to where you are.

537
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,219
So after two years, you come back to your bank and you say, how's my money doing?

538
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,880
And they say, good news, sir, there's twice as much of it.

539
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,900
You say, that's fantastic, it's only been two years.

540
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,280
And they say, bad news, it's all imaginary.

541
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,060
So, very good for your Monopoly game, not great for life logistics.

542
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,280
But it gets worse.

543
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,630
As you wait more time, and you add another 90 degree rotation of where you currently are, 

544
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,600
you're going to step into the negative real territory.

545
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,614
So at this point, now you have negative 200 real dollars, 

546
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:04,100
but you still have that 200 imaginary dollars.

547
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,280
So, good for your Monopoly game, devastating now for your actual life.

548
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,540
But it gets worse.

549
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,177
As we take another step, four years later, after you've invested your hard-earned money, 

550
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:18,105
you've not even invested, you weren't even putting it at risk, 

551
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:19,500
it was just a savings account.

552
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,660
And where do you end up?

553
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,380
For every dollar you put in, you would now have negative four dollars.

554
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,960
So you come to the bank and they say, well, you owe 

555
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,200
us $400 for the $100 that you put in four years ago.

556
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,400
And just as you're about to get outraged at them, they say, sir, we encourage you to wait.

557
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,640
We really do think this is going to work out for you.

558
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,341
If you just let your money sit, do its work, and 

559
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:42,660
in the long run this will work out for you.

560
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,051
And they're not entirely wrong, because if you keep playing this game of 

561
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:51,565
rotating 90 degrees and then adding that vector, after a total of eight years, 

562
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:55,280
where you're going to end up is at 16 times your original amount.

563
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,680
Not too bad.

564
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,472
So if you're willing to put up with a lot of stress going in, 

565
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:03,775
changing your monopoly game, changing your real life, 

566
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:09,220
and you were willing to just hold for eight total years, you would have 16 times as much.

567
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,520
So that's pretty good, I would say.

568
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,260
We might call this the venture capitalist approach, where you put in your money, 

569
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,320
you can't see it for a long time, and most of the time it's completely imaginary.

570
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,320
But every now and then you get a giant multiple at the end.

571
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,733
Now before you excitedly do this, though, let's say 

572
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:32,100
that your bank doesn't compound it annually, right?

573
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,560
And they say, ah, actually we compound your interest continuously.

574
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,196
Meaning that our time steps are not delta t of one year, 

575
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,720
but it's delta t getting smaller and smaller.

576
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,181
Well what that means is that each one of your steps that's 

577
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:48,180
perpendicular to where you are is really just a tiny little step.

578
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,640
And I'm showing with the arrows here what happens if you wait eight total years.

579
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,685
So you take a tiny step that's perpendicular to where you are, 

580
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:58,360
another tiny step that's perpendicular to where you are, and you keep going.

581
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,377
But as that time step gets smaller and smaller, smaller and smaller and smaller, 

582
00:37:03,377 --> 00:37:06,834
to the point where it's genuinely continuously compounding interest, 

583
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:09,840
what it means is that you're simply walking around a circle.

584
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,325
So if you were writing this out as an expression, you know, 

585
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:18,011
it might seem halfway reasonable to look at the fact that we 

586
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:22,000
were using e to the x as a shorthand for this limiting value here.

587
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,980
And in the case of real numbers that makes total sense when we plug in a value for x.

588
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,091
But what it means here is with our imaginary money, 

589
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:35,800
we're writing it as e to the i, that was our interest rate, times the amount of time.

590
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,078
Nonsense if we think about repeated multiplication, 

591
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:43,066
but in the context of compounding interest, all it really means is that after 

592
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:46,798
taking a bunch of steps that are perpendicular to your current position, 

593
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:50,530
and we do that continuously, so those time steps are just infinitesimal, 

594
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,320
it has you walking around a circle.

595
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:56,880
So, the bank offers you this, do you take it?

596
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,360
Well let's think it through.

597
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,440
What happens when you put in $100 to your savings account?

598
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,127
Well if you wait a total of pi halves years, which is the 

599
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:09,152
distance along a quarter of a circle, a little over a year and a half, 

600
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,100
you come back into your account and what do you see?

601
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,300
Well, for each dollar you put in, you have an imaginary dollar.

602
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,280
Not great.

603
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,572
But you push through, you know, the banker told you that this will work out in the end, 

604
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:24,860
so you say, okay, I'm gonna wait.

605
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,497
I didn't need it for that year and a half, life wasn't going too terribly, 

606
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:32,669
so I'm just gonna let my money still sit in that savings account for another year and 

607
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:33,300
a half or so.

608
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,620
And you wait a total of pi years, around 3.14 years.

609
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,380
You come back, and now it really doesn't look good.

610
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,180
Now, you've got negative one dollar for each dollar that you originally put in.

611
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,050
And just like before, you're infuriated at the bank, not as much as you were, 

612
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,279
because it hasn't gone out to be negative four, but it's still negative, 

613
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:52,120
and that's not fun.

614
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,300
And the bank says, hold on, hold on, sir, we think 

615
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,480
this is actually gonna work out for you in the end.

616
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,216
You say, okay, I've seen this work out for my friends who got 16 times their money, 

617
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,120
so I'll just hold.

618
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,629
And you do, you just don't touch the money in your savings account, 

619
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:07,460
you wait another year and a half and you check.

620
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,280
And now, not only is it entirely imaginary, it's negative.

621
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,560
So you can't live your real life, and you also can't even play Monopoly well.

622
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,660
So, 4.7 years is a real low during this whole experience.

623
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,926
But if you're willing to stick it out, and wait a total of 6.28 years, 2 pi years, 

624
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:28,200
you come back, and for all of your stress, you're back to where you started.

625
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,280
You just have one dollar for every dollar that you put in originally.

626
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,560
So, should you accept this interest rate from your bank?

627
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,274
Depends on how much emotional turmoil you want, 

628
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:41,360
but if it's continuously compounding, certainly not, I think is the appropriate answer.

629
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,180
Now, is this at all useful?

630
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,024
This is kind of fun, I think, to take an idea that started off only 

631
00:39:49,024 --> 00:39:52,013
relevant to real numbers, you know, a 12% interest rate, 

632
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:55,840
or if you have negative interest rates, you can think of how that decays.

633
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
And say, well, what if we did something else to it?

634
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,920
What if each time step wasn't in the direction, but it was perpendicular to the direction?

635
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,173
And the answer is that this is actually incredibly relevant to 

636
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,840
anything that involves what's called simple harmonic motion in physics.

637
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,660
And so a great example of this is a spring.

638
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,100
Let's say we wanted to understand the motion of a spring.

639
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,800
So let me pull this up here.

640
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,540
I think I have an actual spring sitting somewhere here, if it didn't roll off my table.

641
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,200
I had trouble finding any reasonable ones, so I tried to just extract one from my pen.

642
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,080
Maybe not the greatest physics demo in the world, but I've got one.

643
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,118
So the idea here is that if I pull the spring, 

644
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:43,600
it's pushing me back in the other direction against how I pull it.

645
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,700
And similarly, if I push on it, then it's pushing me in the other direction.

646
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,460
It's trying to get back to that equilibrium point.

647
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,943
And the way that it does this obeys, at least to a loose 

648
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:57,460
approximation for a lot of springs, something called Hooke's law.

649
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,258
So if I draw out a spring, and let's imagine that 

650
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:05,440
there's some mass sitting at the end of it.

651
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,940
Let's say that this is where it wants to be.

652
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,299
This is the equilibrium position, kind of like how my spring is 

653
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:17,180
sitting here before it just rolls away with no forces acting on the mass.

654
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:22,771
But if you stretch it out, if I pull it, that same mass at the end, 

655
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:28,034
this distance, what we might call the displacement of our mass, 

656
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:33,380
ends up influencing how much force the spring is pulling back on.

657
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,500
Because intuitively we know that the spring is pulling back with some kind of force.

658
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,040
And what Hooke's law suggests is that it's a force proportional to that size of x.

659
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,884
And we use k as a proportionality constant and negative 

660
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:48,780
to emphasize that it's pointed in the opposite direction.

661
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,817
So in this context, what we're saying is if we double the amount that we're pulling it, 

662
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:56,260
it's going to pull us back with twice the force.

663
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,760
If we triple it, it pulls us back with three times the force.

664
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,160
As with any kind of physical models, this is only true to an approximation.

665
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,517
You know, if we pull the spring such that we just distort it entirely, 

666
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:08,680
this certainly won't apply.

667
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:13,959
And often with anything that involves the simple harmonic motion we're about to describe, 

668
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:16,320
it tends to only be true for small variations.

669
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,200
And as you get larger variations, the model would have to change.

670
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,360
But this is a pretty good one, and it's very general.

671
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,180
It comes up in a lot of different circumstances.

672
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,800
Now force is mass times acceleration.

673
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,920
This is what force is.

674
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,100
This is what Newton's second law tells us.

675
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,620
It says, what is your mass?

676
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,680
I'm telling you how much you're going to accelerate.

677
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,044
Acceleration is how much your velocity changes, 

678
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:41,360
velocity being how much the value of x changes.

679
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,833
Now this is quite interesting, because what it means is that acceleration, 

680
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:50,986
which is influencing the displacement, kind of in a second order way 

681
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:55,260
via how it influences velocity, is itself influenced by the value of x.

682
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,600
So I'm going to go ahead and ask you a quiz question here.

683
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,160
It's basically to have us think about what velocity 

684
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,460
and acceleration really mean in a context like this.

685
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,360
So we'll pull up our quiz again.

686
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,780
We are going to go to the final live question for this lesson.

687
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,980
Which is a big one, but it's largely just stating what I just did.

688
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,200
A mass on a spring is pulled a distance x away from an equilibrium point.

689
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,040
If the spring obeys Hooke's law, the mass will experience a force of 

690
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,140
f equals negative kx, x being that displacement, for some constant k.

691
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,347
Keep in mind, by Newton's second law, f equals ma, 

692
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:37,240
where m is the mass and a is the acceleration.

693
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,688
If the mass starts out with a displacement of x naught and a velocity of v naught, 

694
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:49,684
which of the following most clearly describes the changes of these 

695
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:53,040
values after a small change in time, delta t?

696
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,376
Okay, so we're going to let time play out for a tiny step in time, 

697
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:02,253
and it wants us to know which of these four options best describes what that change to 

698
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:07,074
the x value is going to look like, delta x, and what the change to the velocity value 

699
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:08,420
will look like, delta v.

700
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,780
So I'll give you a little bit of time for this one.

701
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,683
While you're thinking about that, we've got another question in about quaternions, 

702
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:51,480
not entirely relevant to the lesson, but certainly a very interesting idea and question.

703
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,112
So if you're enjoying this kind of side plot to the full lecture, 

704
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:59,200
rotation in 2D requires one extra number, i.

705
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,631
So why is it that it requires three extra numbers, 

706
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:05,560
i, j, k, and not just two, i and j, for 3D rotation?

707
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,757
Is there an equivalent way for rotation in four dimensions, 

708
00:45:08,757 --> 00:45:11,040
and how many extra numbers are required there?

709
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,220
Okay, awesome question.

710
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,835
So a way to think about this, in complex numbers or in two dimensions, 

711
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:20,328
you only need one degree of freedom to describe rotation, okay, 

712
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:23,440
you just need to describe the angle that you're rotating.

713
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,938
And so you might say, oh, why do we need a 2D number system in 

714
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:29,680
order to describe something that only has one degree of freedom?

715
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,240
And the idea is that it's nice to live in a slightly bigger space so 

716
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,196
that we can have a circle, something where you come back on itself, 

717
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:39,240
and then we just constrain all of the rotating actions to that circle.

718
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,716
So the way that complex numbers describe rotation is 

719
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:44,100
entirely based on the numbers that sit on a circle.

720
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,620
It's only one dimension's worth of numbers in some sense.

721
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,200
Awesome.

722
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,284
So for three-dimensional rotation, it's not just two extra degrees of freedom you have, 

723
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:56,660
you actually have three degrees of freedom to describe any 3D rotation.

724
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,540
You might think of it as saying, choose an axis for your rotation, 

725
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,100
a latitude and longitude that you're going to poke a hole through the entire Earth.

726
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,553
And then after you choose that latitude and longitude, 

727
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:10,987
two degrees of freedom for your axis, you have another degree of freedom for 

728
00:46:10,987 --> 00:46:11,880
how much you rotate.

729
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,480
So it's a total of three degrees of freedom to describe rotation in three dimensions.

730
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,297
Now again, you could say, in principle, we should be able to do this with a 

731
00:46:21,297 --> 00:46:25,927
three-dimensional space, where somehow you associate the three degrees of freedom of 3D 

732
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:28,978
space with the three degrees of freedom of your rotation, 

733
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:32,555
which you kind of can with a thing called stereographic projection, 

734
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:36,080
which is entirely what the video I did about quaternions was about.

735
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,822
But, in the same way that to describe rotations, 

736
00:46:38,822 --> 00:46:41,940
it's nice to have a circle, something that lives one dimension higher.

737
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,600
To describe 3D rotations, it's nice to have a hypersphere, 

738
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,580
basically something that loops back on itself, but it has three degrees of freedom on it.

739
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,620
Very weird for us to think about, but that's sort of the degrees of freedom argument.

740
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,580
And then four dimensions, rotations would actually have ten degrees of freedom.

741
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,281
There's not a number system for it, but if you're trying to 

742
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,677
constrain your matrices and understand things like that, 

743
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:06,620
which again, this is, if none of this makes sense to you, don't worry.

744
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,680
It's not in the spirit of this particular lecture or the target audience for it.

745
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,820
But it's an interesting topic.

746
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,160
And if it's what you're chatting about on Twitter, I'm happy to chime in on that.

747
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,586
So, yeah, thinking about degrees of freedom and the fact that it's nice to live one 

748
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:26,223
dimension higher to have, basically have a more interesting surface than flat Euclidean 

749
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:26,540
space.

750
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,518
Okay, with that as our changing scenes abruptly from the side plot of quaternions, 

751
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:36,369
we return back to our regular programming of physics and how 

752
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:39,020
it's relevant to imaginary interest rates.

753
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:45,060
Locking in our answers here, it looks like most of you correctly answered A.

754
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,160
And what is A saying here?

755
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,889
It's saying that the change to x is whatever your velocity was 

756
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:56,600
times the small step in time, which that's what velocity is, right?

757
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,080
It's saying how many meters per second.

758
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,620
What is the change in distance per unit time?

759
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,240
So you multiply it by the change in time.

760
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,269
And then the only tricky part is knowing that the 

761
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:08,480
velocity changes based on acceleration times delta t.

762
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,460
And acceleration in this case, we can work out based on the various equations.

763
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Not sure if you can hear, but there's some sirens in the background.

764
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,660
In general, whenever I'm recording, it's so annoying when there's background noise.

765
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,880
So one of the nice things about live is that I just have no option.

766
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,840
So background noise needs to be tolerated.

767
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,901
Anyway, if we want to write a pure expression for the acceleration, 

768
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:37,160
what it looks like is, just rearranging, negative k over m times x.

769
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,760
Now for where we're going with this, it's going to be a little bit simpler.

770
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,320
This is a classic mathematician thing to do.

771
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,720
Ignore the like real numbers.

772
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,671
And just assume that we're working with whatever units we need to, 

773
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,480
such that k over m is equal to 1.

774
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:57,580
And then what we can say is that the acceleration is negative x.

775
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,040
And the reason I want to do that will hopefully become apparent in a moment.

776
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,171
Now the way I want you to think about this spring 

777
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:07,400
setup is going to look a little weird at first.

778
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,092
I'm going to have you follow two different numbers, 

779
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:15,380
which is basically the displacement of our mass sitting up here, what is x.

780
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,760
But then you also want to know the velocity.

781
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,610
So let's say it's not just up there holding still, 

782
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,740
it was actually moving a little bit with some kind of velocity to the right.

783
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,900
You need to understand those two numbers to follow the system as a whole.

784
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,000
And I'm going to package those two numbers together 

785
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,780
as a single point in two dimensional space.

786
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,556
So let's say I had some position, or some state I should say, 

787
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:43,600
that has a small displacement but then a large velocity.

788
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:50,330
I'm going to think of that as simply being a point, or maybe I draw an arrow to it, 

789
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:56,500
thinking of it as a point in two dimensional space, with coordinates x and v.

790
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,520
All I'm doing is packaging them together as a single point.

791
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,303
And then what we might write is that the change to our two coordinates, 

792
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:12,042
the change to x, v, looks like, well, the way x changes is 

793
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:16,300
based on your velocity times a little change in time.

794
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,860
That's what velocity is.

795
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,380
And the way velocity changes, same deal but with acceleration.

796
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,660
But acceleration is negative x for this system.

797
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,680
So it's going to be negative x times delta t.

798
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:34,446
So we have a value that changes, and in fact the way that it changes 

799
00:50:34,446 --> 00:50:38,960
is going to be based on a little vector perpendicular to itself.

800
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,300
Which is what happens when you swap the variables and you make one negative.

801
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,946
And let me just talk through this, not in the context of writing them 

802
00:50:46,946 --> 00:50:50,780
down as two separate coordinates, but in the context of imaginary numbers.

803
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,899
Which feels like a very weird thing to do, but just walk through with 

804
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:58,960
me this process because it feels so elegant once you let it play out.

805
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,880
I'm going to package this pair of numbers as a single complex number where the 

806
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,540
real part is the position of the spring and the imaginary part is the velocity.

807
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,760
Again, totally crazy thing to do.

808
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,720
If that feels weird or you don't understand it, that's fine, it's not a natural thing.

809
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,776
But if we play this out and we start walking through the math, 

810
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:20,620
hopefully it starts to justify itself.

811
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:27,543
Because what I can write is that the change to this state, 

812
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:34,840
this complex number, is actually equal to negative i times itself.

813
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,840
Times x plus i times v times delta t.

814
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,120
Why?

815
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,780
Well, let me expand this out.

816
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:51,060
When I take that negative i, negative i times x is going to be negative x times i.

817
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,880
Negative i times iv is going to be negative i squared times v.

818
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,320
i squared is negative 1, so that's just going to end up being v.

819
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,360
So it's that whole number times our delta t.

820
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,860
What is this saying?

821
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,769
It says the change to the real part corresponds to v, 

822
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:11,580
the velocity, which is what we saw up here.

823
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,160
The change to the first coordinate is based on v.

824
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,000
And the change to the imaginary part is based on the negative of the real part.

825
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,854
The change to your velocity, the acceleration, 

826
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:25,360
what corresponds to force, is based on negative x.

827
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,743
So this weird idea of Hooke's Law, where the force that the spring 

828
00:52:29,743 --> 00:52:34,191
is pulling on turns out to be in the same, against the direction of 

829
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:37,266
displacement and proportional to displacement, 

830
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:41,780
lends itself to a very strange but natural description of our system 

831
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,220
with a complex number.

832
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,270
And I could write this even more compactly by saying, 

833
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:50,360
let's describe our whole state with a number z.

834
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:59,580
The way that z changes is equal to negative i times itself times a small step in time.

835
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,612
Geometrically, what that looks like is taking wherever you started, 

836
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:07,868
multiplying it by negative i, which rotates at 90 degrees, 

837
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:11,180
so this is a 90 degree angle, and then taking a little step.

838
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,409
And then now you're at a new state, and you rotate that new state by 90 degrees, 

839
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:21,080
scale it down by delta t, whatever your time step is, and you take another step.

840
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,500
And you take another step.

841
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,087
And you keep doing this, and just like what we saw earlier for compound 

842
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:31,580
interest that was imaginary, what you end up doing is walking around a circle.

843
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,140
Now this is maybe the worst attempt at a circle I've ever drawn.

844
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,000
This should go out a little bit further, something like that.

845
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Ignore my dotted lines there.

846
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,183
Now let's gut check to see if this intuitively 

847
00:53:43,183 --> 00:53:44,960
makes sense that that's what our spring would do.

848
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,880
Because this vertical axis is the velocity.

849
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,358
So what we're saying is if you start off with a high velocity and a low displacement, 

850
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,793
so your spring, your mass is moving fast, but it's not that far away from the equilibrium 

851
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:02,180
point, well yeah, x is going to increase, because that's what it means to be moving fast.

852
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,000
So the x component, the real component here, is getting bigger and bigger.

853
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,489
And in the meantime, the y component, the velocity is slowing down, 

854
00:54:09,489 --> 00:54:11,160
because the spring is pulling it back.

855
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,500
So our y component is getting smaller and smaller, 

856
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,225
until we reach a point where there's no velocity, 

857
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:20,060
and it's as far out in the x component as it can go.

858
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,011
So we've kind of swung out, and then it's as far out as it can go, 

859
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,740
and then it's going to start turning around.

860
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,440
The x component is going to start decreasing, and the velocity is negative.

861
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:34,046
And in general, this is just going to walk around a circle in our complex plane, 

862
00:54:34,046 --> 00:54:37,740
where the use of a complex plane feels kind of bizarre here.

863
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,700
But maybe intuitively, that's not that crazy a thought.

864
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,407
Whatever piece of math is describing the physics of a spring that goes back and forth, 

865
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,888
and critically I should specify this is a spring where we're not taking 

866
00:54:48,888 --> 00:54:52,322
into account friction, so it'll just oscillate back and forth forever, 

867
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,740
that oscillation corresponds with circular motion.

868
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,220
And we can see this maybe even more concretely if we write out the math of it.

869
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,861
So what we just saw is that imaginary compound interest invites us to write the solution, 

870
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:09,436
the place that we're going to be after an amount of time t, 

871
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:14,321
as wherever we were in the beginning, times e to the power of that interest rate, 

872
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:17,360
where in this case the interest rate is negative i.

873
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,751
The thing influencing how you change, it's not in the direction of where you are, 

874
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,220
it's 90 degrees to where you are, times the time.

875
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,744
This is actually a reasonable way to write things, 

876
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:32,340
and it mirrors how you might see things written in certain parts of actual physics.

877
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,274
This e to the i t term shows up any time you have this kind of oscillation, 

878
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:40,696
and the oscillation often corresponds to forces that are proportional to the displacement 

879
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:41,040
itself.

880
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,040
It all loops together, it's all connected.

881
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:50,323
Now if you wanted to make this, I don't know, connect with the kind of graphs and 

882
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:56,355
functions that we see elsewhere, you could write this using Euler's formula, 

883
00:55:56,355 --> 00:56:03,327
writing the expansion of the fact that e to an imaginary constant walks around a circle, 

884
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:09,360
as your initial state times the cosine of t, and minus i times the sine of t.

885
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,724
And what this is basically saying is if we were to independently graph 

886
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:20,540
the displacements and the velocities, they would look like sine waves.

887
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,792
Okay, so I'm just going to draw out a couple different plots here, 

888
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:31,089
where on each one I'm going to let the x-axis represent time that we're moving forward, 

889
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,460
and in one of them we're going to plot the displacement.

890
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,760
Well let's say the displacement started off entirely at one and the velocity was zero.

891
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,399
What it would look like would just be this cosine of t, excuse me, 

892
00:56:44,399 --> 00:56:50,880
cosine of t real component of our weird complex number description of things.

893
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,345
But if that all feels weird, hopefully it feels more concrete when you 

894
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:59,135
realize all that saying is that the position of the spring oscillates 

895
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:03,414
back and forth in a nice little cosine wave, which matches physical intuition, 

896
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:06,880
it kind of oscillates back and forth in this gentle smooth wave.

897
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:12,796
And then similarly the velocity, let's say it started off at zero, 

898
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:19,297
what our Euler's formula is telling us is that this will end up being a negative 

899
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:20,100
sine wave.

900
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,396
So it's going to start off at zero, but then it's going to go down, 

901
00:57:25,396 --> 00:57:28,368
basically because it started off, you know, as far as it could be, 

902
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:30,852
and then it's going to point in the opposite direction, 

903
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:32,760
bringing the mass back towards equilibrium.

904
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,798
And then the velocity will reach some minimum and 

905
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:38,000
then it'll come back up until the velocity is zero.

906
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,740
This is when the spring goes all the way to the other end.

907
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,735
And then the velocity will be positive for a while 

908
00:57:43,735 --> 00:57:46,300
and it'll keep oscillating back and forth like that.

909
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,668
And I'm sure I haven't quite lined up the waves appropriately, 

910
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:52,830
but the idea that each one of them is a sort of sinusoidal pattern, 

911
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,316
and that they're out of sync with each other, hopefully lines up with some 

912
00:57:56,316 --> 00:57:57,200
physical reasoning.

913
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,788
And I just think it's beautiful that what you can see is happening is it is 

914
00:58:02,788 --> 00:58:07,751
two different shadows of circular motion in an abstract mathematical idea, 

915
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:12,780
of packaging the two components as a real and imaginary part of some number.

916
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,040
Because this Hooke's law let us describe things at a 90 degree angle.

917
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,180
And all of that is actually deeper than you might think it is.

918
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,499
There's certain formalizations of classical Newtonian mechanics that 

919
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:28,320
introduce complex numbers for pretty similar reasons to what's going on here.

920
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,180
It's all a bit advanced, I won't necessarily go into it.

921
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,936
But what I want to emphasize is that this original question we asked of 

922
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:39,352
what happens if your bank offers you an imaginary interest rate isn't totally insane, 

923
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:42,997
and in fact, at least it's insane for money, but it's not insane as an 

924
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:46,540
abstract idea to pursue, and it corresponds to some very real things.

925
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,466
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and take one final question from the audience, 

926
00:58:51,466 --> 00:58:52,800
and then say my goodbyes.

927
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,680
So the last question we have for today.

928
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,543
Can we get some hints or thoughts on the last challenge from the previous lecture, 

929
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:02,240
particularly exp of x for matrices?

930
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,180
Excellent.

931
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,000
That was a hard question, by the way, the homework that I left at the end of last lecture.

932
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,903
So remember, last lecture we were talking all about thinking of the exponential function 

933
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:19,807
as this infinite polynomial, and hopefully today the fact that it came from our limiting 

934
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:25,380
expression, I didn't show why, but we could call that homework number two for today.

935
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,054
If you're really ambitious, it's showing that this expression that comes 

936
00:59:30,054 --> 00:59:34,136
from compound interest ends up expanding to be this polynomial, 

937
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:39,620
which is what we mean anytime we refer to e to the x in math, at least in modern math.

938
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:45,418
So I asked some questions on the homework that involved expanding this 

939
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:50,237
out all around trying to understand the crucial equation that when you 

940
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:55,260
add two numbers in the input, this is the same as multiplying two outputs.

941
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,280
Okay.

942
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,860
And then what we have on screen is asking about for matrices, what goes on here.

943
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,790
So the thing that again, this is kind of advanced and maybe I feel a little 

944
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:12,320
bit bad about that if I didn't properly emphasize it in giving the homework.

945
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:18,454
The thing I want you to notice is when you go through parts one and two of 

946
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:23,460
the homework where you're expanding it out, and especially in the case of 

947
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:28,738
part two where you're expanding things out, to think critically about whether 

948
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:33,880
the commutative property, x times y equals y times x, is needed or relevant.

949
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:39,040
Because often when we expand out binomial terms, it assumes that this is true.

950
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:44,148
And the reason that the math for expanding binomial terms looks like what it does, 

951
01:00:44,148 --> 01:00:47,610
the reason it works has everything to do with the fact that 

952
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,860
order of multiplication doesn't matter.

953
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:57,400
This is particularly relevant in part two where we're expanding this exp of x plus y.

954
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,119
And when you do that, you're going to run into 

955
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,680
these terms that look like x plus y to the power n.

956
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,902
And then the parts of that are going to end up looking 

957
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:12,160
like n choose k where this is the binomial constant.

958
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,920
So that's a bit of prerequisite knowledge.

959
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,360
If you don't have the prerequisite knowledge, don't feel intimidated by these problems.

960
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,120
It just means that there's a little bit more to learn.

961
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,820
The only reason that this expansion would work is if you have the commutative property.

962
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,040
So it's very subtle.

963
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,716
But what this means is that the whole line of argumentation to show 

964
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:36,555
this property doesn't work if the things that you're plugging in don't 

965
01:01:36,555 --> 01:01:40,340
commute with each other, where x times y is not necessarily y times x.

966
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,462
For complex numbers this is true, for real numbers this is true, 

967
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:45,480
but for matrices that's actually not true.

968
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,344
And this is one of the reasons, by the way, I actually 

969
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:52,000
think writing e to the x for this is a bad convention.

970
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,407
Because you have this bizarre situation where when you have matrices, 

971
01:01:56,407 --> 01:02:01,429
and this does come up, there's real math that's done where you are exponentiating 

972
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:06,635
matrices, the notation inspires you to think, oh, I should be able to write this as, 

973
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:11,780
you know, exponentiating a times exponentiating b should be exponentiating a plus b.

974
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,760
But this is actually not true.

975
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,260
This is not true in the case of matrices.

976
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,530
We talked a little about quaternions today in the side plot, 

977
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,420
it's not true in the case of quaternions.

978
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,388
So this convention of writing it as e to the x is incredibly 

979
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:30,074
confusing as soon as you start extending into the realms where it's most useful, 

980
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:33,140
where you have this particularly powerful polynomial.

981
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,244
And I'm just, I don't know, I think that is a fact worth emphasizing, 

982
01:02:38,244 --> 01:02:43,165
which is maybe why I wanted to sneak it into the homework, only later realizing that, 

983
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:47,742
you know, if honestly my intention is to introduce people to the idea just at a 

984
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:51,804
high level that this e to the x function is more than you think it is, 

985
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:56,496
maybe jumping straight to the crazy idea of matrices and expecting them to notice 

986
01:02:56,496 --> 01:03:01,187
the nuance of commutativity being relevant to the n choose k formula for binomial 

987
01:03:01,187 --> 01:03:01,760
expansion.

988
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,886
Like, actually there's kind of a lot of advanced 

989
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:05,900
things that go in there if we're really dissecting it.
