00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome back to Lockdown Math, where we try to answer some of the important questions in life,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,340
some of the deeper things that are relevant, push your life forward.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,260
Like for example, what if you have a bank that offers you an interest rate of the square root of negative one?

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,160
A negative, not even a negative interest rate, we thought that was weird enough, an imaginary interest rate.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,580
Should you take it?

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,660
Now I almost guarantee, however interesting you think this question is, it's going to be more interesting than that.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,400
I think there's going to be some people who find it totally nonsensical, right, which is reasonable.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,720
What on earth would it mean for your money to grow by the square root of negative one?

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
And I think there's also some people who think they know where this lesson is going,

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,440
but wherever you sit, I almost guarantee this is going to be more interesting than you think.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,220
And to start things off, let me bring back our poll that we were doing, you know, during the warm-up animations,

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,020
and I just want to get a sense for what your instinct is on this apparently nonsensical question.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,660
Okay, so obviously there's no right or wrong answer here, it's something that we're going to answer by the end,

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,140
but I'm genuinely curious what you viewing right now think.

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,880
If a bank offers you an annual interest rate of the square root of negative one, do you take it?

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,380
So if you want to participate either in this poll or any of the live quizzing that we do throughout,

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,660
obviously 3b1b.co slash live is where you can go, link in the description as well.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,260
And while you're answering this, I just want to mention that even if this is kind of a nonsensical question for money,

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,140
one of the things I'd like to show by the end is that thinking through the details of this question

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,640
is shockingly relevant to physics, okay, and to understanding simple harmonic motion.

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,620
So even if it feels like nonsense, if you're willing to engage with the weird storyline for a bit,

22
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,320
there is a satisfying real-world endpoint for that.

23
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,380
The other thing I want to mention is a brief plug for a video by Mathologer.

24
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,900
If you guys don't know Mathologer, you're certainly in for a treat.

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,680
But he did this one called E to the Pi I for Dummies, and in general the channel is just full of gems.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,840
But this video in particular contains a lot of the things that I want to talk about today,

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,740
and it's just so beautifully done. It's extremely well presented, extremely approachable.

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,660
Burkhard who presents it is extremely lovable, so could not recommend that and other things highly enough.

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,000
Good thing to watch maybe right after this, or even if you're watching this in the future, you know, to watch right before this.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,860
So looking back at our poll, fascinating! We've got a very even split between the yeses and the nos.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,620
I wouldn't have guessed that, actually, and I'm curious if by the end of this, once we see what the implications would be,

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,860
how many of you would stand by your answers.

33
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,460
So let me just, let me just see what this distribution is, because I am curious to know.

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,340
Alright, so it looks like 1,600 and 1,700 of you said yes, you would take the imaginary interest rate.

35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,060
And then 1,645 of you said no.

36
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,140
Alright, we'll see if you stand by that by the end, and we'll really understand the implications of imaginary interest.

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,760
Now before that, let's ask a question that is a little bit more real world,

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,240
because I think we should spend the first, I don't know, half hour of the lesson or so on actual normal compound interest, right?

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
The kind of interest that we would all usually think of.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,260
Make sure we can build up some of the math of that, and then once we have the math of that,

41
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,020
see how we can tweak it to answer our, well, frankly silly question.

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,280
Okay, so as our first, I don't even want to call it a real question, it's still meant as an opinion poll.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,840
Don't necessarily think you have to do the computation.

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,600
What I want to gauge is what your gut reaction to this question is, okay?

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,420
So there is a correct answer, but just answer what you think it might be.

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,160
So the question asks, two banks offer different interest rates on your savings.

47
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,140
Bank A will increase your savings by 12% every year, okay?

48
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,080
Pretty good bank.

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,980
Bank B will increase your savings by 1% every month.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,300
Again, I wish my bank worked like this.

51
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,860
With each of these banks, you set up an account with $100, and after one year, which of the following is true?

52
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,680
So you have more money with bank A by more than $1, so the difference between what you have in A and B is greater than $1.

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,760
You have more money in bank A but by less than $1.

54
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,240
You have the same amount in each, more in bank B but by less than $1, or more in bank B by more than $1.

55
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,660
Okay, so it seems like we have pretty strong consensus.

56
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't know if I would call that strong consensus actually.

57
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,060
There's a clear winner, but there's definitely a lot of contention behind it.

58
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,240
And in general, by the way, while these answers are rolling in, I'll sometimes be pulling up questions from the audience, which you can ask via Twitter.

59
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,780
So the link is in the description for where you can go to ask these sorts of questions.

60
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,820
And it looks like someone with the profile of Yoda asks,

61
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:21,160
What a poetically written tweet, which seems pretty fitting for someone with a profile of Yoda in there.

62
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,960
I mean, it's a subjective question. Personally, I do think the most beautiful things are the ones that have unexpected connections.

63
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,840
And I don't know if that's like a natural thing that humans just love to see things that seemed unrelated come together.

64
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:41,600
Humor seems to have this root, like a really good joke kind of takes you by surprise, but when there's some kind of logical connection, it's not just surprise for its own sake.

65
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,840
And as the lesson goes on, if you have questions relevant to what we're talking about, ask them there and we'll pull them up on screen.

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,880
So, like I said, there's technically a right answer to this question, but I don't really want it to be treated as right or wrong.

67
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,600
The reason I'm asking this one is to get kind of an opinion poll to know where people are starting.

68
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,360
So I'm going to go ahead and lock in the answers and see where people are.

69
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,980
Interesting! This might be the first time in lockdown math history that the plurality has not gotten what turns out to be the correct answer.

70
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,240
So most of you said you would have more money with bank B and it would be by more than a dollar.

71
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,440
The second most common answer was to say you'd have more money with bank B by less than a dollar, which turns out to be correct.

72
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,700
We're going to walk through that in a moment.

73
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,840
After that, more with bank A.

74
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:40,800
And I think the ones that I most empathize with, if I look back at what maybe an initial response to questions like this would be, if you haven't thought about interest, is everyone who said C.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,220
You know, it's not obvious that 12% over a year is going to be any different than 1% per month.

76
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,000
You're like, 1% per month? That should add up to 12% over the year.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,100
And I think it's worth just thinking through exactly why that's not the case.

78
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,160
So, how do we think about this kind of problem?

79
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,080
I've gone ahead and pulled up a Desmos graph for us to play around with.

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,500
So we'll get rid of Burckardt's beautiful face and we'll head on over to Desmos.

81
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,460
And the way I have things configured, it's going to be showing us the graph of what happens to your money, in this case in bank A.

82
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:20,760
So over the first year, at any point that you check in, it's just got that $100 and it's not until the end of the year that it jumps up to $112.

83
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:28,820
And the way you might think about that is by saying, okay, let's take our $100, at the end of the year we add 12% of that $100.

84
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,460
And sensibly enough, you get 112.

85
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:41,920
And a nice way to think about this, which seems simple and it seems kind of innocuous, but this turns out to be a powerful idea.

86
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,600
We'll talk about more why I might want to emphasize that this is more of a significant move than you might think.

87
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,340
The fact that the rate of change is proportional to the thing that's changing means we can factor out this $100.

88
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,780
And we can just say, oh, that step that we take, we're multiplying it by a constant.

89
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
In this case, that constant would be 1.12.

90
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,180
So as you go from this step to the second year, at the end of that second year, your account balance doesn't jump by just $12,

91
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,540
because it's also earning interest on the 12 extra dollars that you got that last year.

92
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,400
So it jumps up to $125.

93
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
It's a multiplicative amount.

94
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:25,140
And this becomes particularly noticeable as we zoom out and see what would happen over the course of many years with such a fantastic interest rate in your bank.

95
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,080
It's not just growing like a straight line, it grows with this exponential curve.

96
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,700
And in fact, if you look at 10 years in, it looks like the Y coordinate of that is around 310.

97
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,460
So you let your money sit in that savings account with 12% interest for 10 years, and you'd end up with three times as much money.

98
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,400
Pretty interesting.

99
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,640
So now when we start thinking about having the interest accrue, not just at the end of the year, but at various chunks on the way in,

100
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,540
let me just ask you another question.

101
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,480
I think this is a fun way to start things off, is rather than having me go through the logic, have you guys think through the details.

102
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,060
So before we jump to the case of doing a step every month, let's just say there was two steps halfway through the year.

103
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
So what does the question ask us?

104
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,920
It says a bank offers to increase the money in your savings account by 6% at the end of every six months.

105
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,460
Which of the following represents how much money will be in your account if you put in $100 and then you wait for one year?

106
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,540
So there's two different six month periods that have passed.

107
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,080
Which of the following expressions shows how much you're going to have?

108
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,220
So I'm going to give you a moment to think through the details of this.

109
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,460
Give you a little pause and ponder music maybe.

110
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:21,360
Okay, as always, I'm probably going to grade this faster than is a reasonable amount of time for someone who really wants to think through the details of things.

111
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,980
So never feel like you're being rushed.

112
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,820
Sometimes it's just that I want to move forward with the lesson.

113
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,100
And it seems like answers are rolling in a little bit more slowly now.

114
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,280
So I'm going to go ahead and lock this in, but as always, feel free to pause and just think things through more yourself if you want.

115
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,780
We're going to explain it in a moment.

116
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:45,080
So the correct expression, which looks like 3,000 of you got, is that it should be $100 times 1 plus 0.6 squared.

117
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,060
Alright?

118
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,100
Now let's think through why that might be the case.

119
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,420
So if we head back over to our Desmos expression that we were working with,

120
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:02,300
If instead of increasing by 12%, we're saying increase by 6%, when you factor it out, it looks like multiplying by 1.06.

121
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,560
And then there's two ways you can think about this.

122
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,280
If you're already comfortable with the idea that increasing by 6% is multiplying by this constant, you say, oh, we just square that.

123
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:18,580
And if you want to think through the details for why that's true, if that's not something you're entirely comfortable with, you can say, let's repeat the process.

124
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,920
So this gets us 106 after that first six month period.

125
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:30,820
Okay, we've got 106, then we're going to add 6%, 0.06 times that 106, and that's going to get us the final amount.

126
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,740
But this we can factor, because the 106 shows up in two places.

127
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,520
Because the rate of growth is proportional to itself, it lets us factor this out as 106 times 1.06.

128
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,180
And then you might realize, oh wait, I'm just multiplying by the same constant that I did before.

129
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,280
So I might as well have just gone and put that constant up there.

130
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,040
And because it's the same constant, I might as well have simply written that as a square.

131
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:06,540
So what that means is if you take these steps of percent increases many, many different times, what it looks like is taking a number that's a little above 1 and then raising it to some kind of power.

132
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,480
So to our original question, asking about bank B, which, what did it say?

133
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,880
It was going to be a 1% increase to your savings every month.

134
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:25,840
The way you might think about that is by saying we multiply by 1.01, okay, by 1 plus that 1%, and then we do it after 12 months.

135
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,300
Okay, so instead of the, instead of the $112 that you would have had from bank A, woo hoo!

136
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,180
It looks like compounding more frequently got us an extra 68 cents in our account.

137
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,560
So, wonderful, right?

138
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:57,520
In our graph, if we wanted to see what that would look like, again, there's some machinery under here that I'll show in a moment, but if I just crank up this number n to 12, that's basically asking how many times per year do I compound this interest?

139
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,640
Do I make a little step increase based on what the annual interest rate is?

140
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:10,700
So if the annual interest rate was 12% and you're making steps each 1 12th of a month, that means you increase by 1% each one of those.

141
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,040
So what it looks like is a step function that's a lot more fine, okay?

142
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:23,300
And we can see how at the end of the one year, the y coordinate of our graph is that $112 with the extra 68 cents.

143
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,540
Not quite a dollar more, but it is more.

144
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,360
And again, as we zoom out, you can see that it fits this nice exponential curve, the power of compound growth.

145
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:46,360
And if you're curious, you know, previously after 10 years, we would have had $310, I think it was, which we can verify for ourselves if I take that $100 times 1 plus 0.12 to the 10th.

146
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
Alright, this says $310.

147
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:55,980
When we compound every month instead, and we wait for 120 months, it looks like we've squeezed out an extra 20 bucks.

148
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,640
So, not bad.

149
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,860
The important part here though, is the idea that the frequency with which you compound actually changes the amount, which is interesting.

150
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:14,680
And this is the original circle of thoughts that Bernoulli was thinking about that leads to the origins of the constant e that we all now know and love.

151
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,440
Maybe the second most famous constant only next to pi.

152
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,420
So let's write out some of what we're doing here, but with some formulas, and then see what we can start learning with respect to those formulas.

153
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:34,480
And this is going to help us understand the bizarre question of an interest rate of negative, not even negative, I keep saying interest rate of negative 1, interest rate of square root of negative 1.

154
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,880
Nobody should let the Fed watch this video, I think it might introduce some shaky ideas.

155
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:53,520
Alright, so the way we might think about this is let's say you start off with some amount of money, okay, and then we're going to let it accrue some interest over some long amount of time, that I'm going to call t.

156
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:03,420
And the idea is that we're chopping this amount of time into a bunch of little pieces, okay, and with each one of these steps we're going to increase our money.

157
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
There's going to be some kind of change to m, a delta m.

158
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,680
And each of these steps, let's say it's got a length of delta t.

159
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:18,460
So maybe delta t is a 12th of a year, or maybe it's 1 365th of a year, it depends on how finely we cut it.

160
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:26,380
And just as another variable to throw down here, let's keep track of how many steps there are along the way, if we were to count them all up.

161
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,980
And the total number would be the total amount of time divided by the size of the time steps that we're taking, okay?

162
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:47,180
So what interest rates do is they say that the amount your money changes is going to equal that interest rate, r, and you might think of r as being something like the 0.12 from our example.

163
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,320
And then later on we're going to play around with making it imaginary.

164
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:00,780
But you're going to multiply it by the size of your time step, okay, which you might think of as being something like 1.12 if we were compounding monthly.

165
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:09,540
Because simply by compounding monthly it doesn't mean you get to grow by 12% every month, it means you grow by 1.12 of what the annual rate was every month.

166
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,840
And then what makes compound growth so powerful, it's also proportional to the amount of money you had.

167
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,080
You know, if you had $100 it grows by a certain amount, if you had $1000 in there it grows by 10 times as much.

168
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,000
The more you have, the more it grows.

169
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,520
Okay, so that in our example you might think of as being something like $100.

170
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,140
Alright, so what's the magic of this?

171
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:40,180
It looks innocuous at first, but it means that our money changes by going to m plus r delta t times m.

172
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:50,560
And because m shows up in both of these terms, it lets us factor things out, so that m factors out and we have 1 plus r delta t.

173
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:59,240
And because this is the same constant that we're going to multiply for each one of these little time steps, all you're doing is multiplying by this constant.

174
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,160
We can write an expression for how much money you're going to have after time t.

175
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:14,720
What it's going to look like is the amount of money you had to start off with at time t equals 0 multiplied by this expression, 1 plus r delta t.

176
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,740
And I'll change this in a moment, but I'll keep writing it as r delta t.

177
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,560
But we multiply it by itself n times, where n is the number of steps that we have in here.

178
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,040
Okay, but there's a lot of different variables at play here, so I want to start consolidating them.

179
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:37,320
And instead of writing delta t, I'm going to go ahead and express delta t as the total time divided by n.

180
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:44,860
We look at the number of chunks we've cut our period into, and we take the total amount of time and divide by that.

181
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:56,000
So what our expression will look like is the amount of money we started with times 1 plus r times the total time divided by n.

182
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,140
So this t divided by n is playing the role of delta t. And we raise that to the nth power.

183
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:11,280
Now this is actually a very interesting expression, no pun intended, because we want to know how does the size of n influence things.

184
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:18,640
If I crank up n a lot, meaning we're chopping our interval into very fine increments and compounding very frequently, what does that mean for our interest?

185
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:34,560
And you might, if you were a pure mathematician, try to abstract away all the ideas of the money here, the specific interest rate, and just say what we're interested in is this function of x that looks like 1 plus 1 over n.

186
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Or maybe I'll say 1 plus x over n. So we want to be able to plug in some value for r t. And we'll raise that to the power n.

187
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:51,280
But you're not just curious about this for any particular n. What you want to know is what happens as you crank up the value of n.

188
00:18:51,740 --> 00:19:03,660
And the expression that mathematicians write for this, we write lim for limit, and then we write n with an arrow to infinity, saying I want to crank up that n and see what happens to this particular value.

189
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:16,840
Now it's not obvious, I think, what happens to it, and playing with my toy again, I just want to do another half-opinion poll, half-real question about this one to see what your instinct is.

190
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:32,620
So let's say, pull up the question here, what happens to the value 100 times 1 plus 0.12 over n to the power n as the value of n approaches infinity?

191
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:41,680
And in the back of your mind, you can think this isn't just a purely mathematical expression, it has a very real meaning in the context of compound interest.

192
00:19:42,280 --> 00:20:00,120
What we're basically saying is if you have that 12% interest rate, and you want to wait one year, but you chop up that year into n different pieces, maybe n is 12 if you compound every month, maybe n is 365 if you compound every day, or maybe you want to compound every microsecond or every picosecond.

193
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,940
The question is, how much money can you get at the end of the year simply by compounding more frequently?

194
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,960
If you'll remember, when we went from yearly to monthly, that gave us an extra 68 cents.

195
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,080
So the question asks, basically, how high can this go?

196
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,980
And now we have a very wide split, which is wonderful.

197
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,240
I'm going to give you guys a couple more moments to think about this.

198
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,560
And I don't want you to calculate it necessarily, the spirit of this question is to see what your initial thought is, kind of intuitively based on the numbers.

199
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,980
So even though technically there's a right answer to this one, so I'll highlight it green, there's no right or wrong here.

200
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,680
The spirit of it is for me to know where people are.

201
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,640
I'll give you just a little bit of time on this.

202
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,240
And while I do, let's take a question from the audience.

203
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,500
Considering that imaginary unit is defined in terms of operations on the real numbers,

204
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,760
is there an analogous definition of quaternions in terms of operations on complex numbers?

205
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,500
Okay, so a bit of an advanced question.

206
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,660
I don't expect most people watching the series to necessarily know what quaternions are.

207
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,380
But it's a number system that instead of including two dimensions, like the complex numbers, involves four dimensions.

208
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,580
The short answer to the question, I think this is okay to say, the short answer is no.

209
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,880
When we get the complex numbers it's because we have an expression that we don't have a solution to.

210
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,600
You want to know the square root of negative one.

211
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,060
A solution to x squared equals negative one.

212
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,420
And by introducing a solution, you extend your number system.

213
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,440
Quaternions don't come about like that.

214
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,540
For any polynomial, once you have the complex numbers, you get all the solutions that you could ever want from that.

215
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:54,000
So it's not going to be there's a problem that you wanted solved in the sense of a solution to a polynomial and you extend it.

216
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,820
But where it does come from is the idea, at least historically, is the idea of wanting to describe motion in three dimensions.

217
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:10,300
And complex numbers can describe things like rotation in two dimensions, but they don't have enough degrees of freedom to describe rotations in three dimensions.

218
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,340
So in that sense it was a concrete problem they couldn't solve.

219
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,460
But the construct that you do to add on top of it doesn't look like a solution to a polynomial.

220
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,780
Kind of a more advanced question than the spirit of the lessons necessarily, but obviously I love to just engage with wherever you are, whoever is watching this.

221
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,080
So back to our question. I'll go ahead and grade it.

222
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,780
And again, technically there's a right answer, but don't view this as right or wrong.

223
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:44,040
It looks like 1670 of you correctly noted that this value would rise above 112, but never above 113.

224
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:52,640
So maybe taking the instincts from the fact that when we went from yearly to monthly we only got 68 cents and saying you can't get much better than that.

225
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,120
The next biggest answer, interesting, was people who said it would rise above 114, but stay below some finite bound.

226
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,800
Okay, so having that instinct that it would stay finite, but that it was going to get bigger than anything listed here.

227
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:15,580
And I think the most thought-provoking answer here is E. The thought that maybe it should blow up to infinity.

228
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,220
I mean, we're letting n get as big as we want. It doesn't just have to be down to the picosecond, it could be down to a plank length.

229
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,600
It could be down to the tiniest, the biggest number that you could think of, so that our time steps are as tiny as you can think.

230
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,740
It's not at all obvious that this thing would remain bounded. So we can play around with this a little bit if we want to.

231
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,060
This won't be a proof that it remains bounded, but maybe it can give us a little bit of an instinct in that direction.

232
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:49,600
If I take 1 plus 0.12 over n, and I raise this to the power n, and I say what happens as we increase n?

233
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,500
And 100, that's not big enough. I want to let myself increase it to some huge number, you know, 100 million.

234
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,300
So the value I want you to watch is sitting right here, okay?

235
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,380
And remember that represents how much money you'll have if you compound your 12% interest much more frequently.

236
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,840
Even as I'm cranking it up around 100 million, this value really stays stable around 1.12.

237
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,100
Here, let's multiply it by the $100 to make it more intuitive.

238
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:25,880
Around the $112.74, about 75 cents, it stays really stable around that even as I'm increasing by a lot.

239
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:36,100
That's not a proof. For all we know, as you venture into the realm of huge, huge numbers, 10 to the 300th, or grams constant, or whatever big number you want,

240
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,360
maybe this thing would slowly crawl up and eventually get unbounded. But it's an interesting fact that it doesn't.

241
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,380
Now, in terms of the math behind this, we can do an interesting manipulation.

242
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,360
Because we have this expression that is a little funky to think about, right?

243
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,760
We've got 1 plus x over n that you might think of as a partial interest rate, and we're raising it to the n.

244
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:06,400
I can do a little substitution and say, what if I define the value m to be n divided by x?

245
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,520
And the reason for doing that would be so that I can write that inside without an x in it.

246
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,780
So x divided by n will be the same as 1 divided by m.

247
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,600
And now I'll be raising that to the power, well not n, well no, the power n, but I want to write it in terms of m.

248
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,700
So it'll look like m times x.

249
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:35,600
And based on how exponents work, I can think of that just as the quantity 1 plus 1 over m to the power n all raised to the x.

250
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,880
And I'm curious about what happens here as I crank the value of m towards infinity.

251
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,920
And Bernoulli was also interested in what happens as we crank this value of m up towards infinity.

252
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:56,920
And empirically, what you'll find is if you just play around with this, and if we go over and take out the evidence that we were dealing with a real world problem,

253
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:04,040
with things like that $100 starting value, or that 12% interest rate, and we just have clean constants like 1 for each of them,

254
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,720
it looks like this value ends up to being around 2.71828.

255
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,120
And no matter how big you make n, it seems to never really get much different than that.

256
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,620
Again, not a proof, but very suggestive that this is maybe a fundamental constant of nature.

257
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:26,020
And so this is the original definition of e, this is the original way that people were thinking about it.

258
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,920
As we pop over here, and we say instead of writing this whole limit expression,

259
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,720
I'll use a different color, say in principle, this is going to approach some kind of constant.

260
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,720
Let's call this constant e that empirically has a value around 2.71828.

261
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,160
And then we can write our whole thing as e to the x.

262
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:59,140
So for example, if we wanted to know what happens in our interest example, when we started out with $0, not $0, started out with m of 0, which might be something like $100,

263
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:11,780
what we do is we just focus on that rt term, we say we know that as we crank up n, this is going to approach some special constant raised to the power of rt.

264
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,400
And maybe this we would aptly describe as continuously compounded growth, if we take that time step and we let it approach 0.

265
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,960
And this was actually before Newton and Leibniz, this was before calculus existed.

266
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,480
There was this idea of trying to take these discrete steps of increasing and make it approach 0 to get something a little bit more continuous.

267
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,920
So I think that's quite cool.

268
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:47,760
And one thing that you might notice here is we've got this large expression for basically a function of x that we now tend to write as e to the x.

269
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:58,300
If you watched the last lecture, you would have remembered that I said the way things have come about in math now, whenever we see e to the x, we actually think of it as a shorthand for a certain polynomial.

270
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:14,140
And the polynomial, I was calling it exp, which follows convention, looks like 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6, and all of the terms look like x to the k divided by k factorial for some whole number k.

271
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:22,460
And I said this is what e to the x is a shorthand for, this is how you think about it, especially when there's weird inputs, things like an imaginary interest rate.

272
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,720
And you might wonder, what on earth does this polynomial have to do with this limiting expression?

273
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:39,100
And as a super extra credit challenge question for those of you who are really into algebra and who are very comfortable with binomial expansion, if you know what those terms mean,

274
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:50,440
if you take this expression for some large value of n and you expand it, you just expand it and you kind of simplify your terms and then you make approximations based on what's true when n is very large,

275
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,620
what you would find is that the polynomial this expands to looks a lot like this polynomial here.

276
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:06,100
And in fact, as this value of n gets bigger and bigger and approaches infinity, this polynomial will get closer and closer to this one.

277
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:14,160
It's a challenging question, so I wouldn't expect everyone to necessarily be able to just bang it out, but if you want to it's a very elucidating exercise.

278
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:28,600
And there's also a lot of delicacy in rigorously proving the fact that what this approaches will also approach this, or that both of them even stay finite and they don't blow up when you add more and more terms to the sum or when you crank up n higher and higher.

279
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,120
There's a lot of delicacy there, but you can probably get to a point where there's an intuitive connection.

280
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:41,300
And the reason that in math we tend to work with this polynomial instead of that limit, it's basically easier for computations and easier for theory.

281
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:52,140
But the value of this other expression is that it ties us back to the idea of compound interest and the idea of taking a quantity that changes a little bit based on its own size.

282
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:59,900
You can kind of readily read this as saying we're going to multiply by a certain constant that's a little above one many, many times.

283
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:12,100
And if you'll remember, the reason we're doing that is when the way that you change is proportional to yourself, that lets you factor things such that you're just multiplying by something a little bigger than one.

284
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:23,340
And when you do this approaching continuity, when you do it in a way where that time step is getting smaller and smaller, this is when we start writing e to the power of something.

285
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:31,600
What it's suggesting is that you have this compound interest expression, but we're letting that n tend towards infinity. We're letting the time step go as small as we want.

286
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:40,740
So, with all of that said, we can start having fun. We can start thinking about our original question of an imaginary interest rate.

287
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
So how on earth is this going to work?

288
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:53,820
First of all, let's just say from the get-go that if we try plugging in r to this expression where we're raising a constant e to a power, it makes no sense.

289
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:03,640
If r is equal to the square root of negative one. You cannot multiply a constant by itself the square root of negative one times. So that doesn't make sense.

290
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:12,180
But what does is if we go to this original expression, the origins of e, and try to imagine plugging in something like i to that.

291
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:22,680
We know how to divide i by n, that's fine. We know how to add it to one, that's fine. We know how to take a complex number and multiply it by itself. All of the operations there are quite fine.

292
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,660
Now let's draw it out to think about what it would look like.

293
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:34,640
And the other thing I want to emphasize is I know this seems like utter nonsense. We're talking about imaginary numbers in the context of interest rates.

294
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:44,580
But in a couple minutes, I really do hope to make this relevant to physics and hope to make you see that this is not a totally nonsensical circle of thoughts.

295
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:54,640
So, I've got my axes here, where this is going to be my real money, and this will be all of my imaginary money.

296
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:10,280
What it means if your interest rate is i, is that the change to the money looks like i times whatever the time step is, delta t, times whatever the money is to begin with.

297
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:21,700
Now, in, I believe it was lecture 3, we talked all about complex numbers, and one of the fundamental facts was that when you multiply i by something, it has the effect of a 90 degree rotation.

298
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,820
And we talked about this in terms of looking at the coordinates and realizing that you just swap the coordinates and make 1 negative 1.

299
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,520
So this connection between the square root of 1 property and the very mechanistic idea of taking a vector and rotating it 90 degrees.

300
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:49,960
Now what this means for us is that the change to your money is going to be a little arrow that, you know, it's not increasing the money, you're not growing, you're not decreasing the money, it's not a negative interest rate, it's moving somehow perpendicular to where the money already is.

301
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:58,120
So after a little step in time, you end up with a little bit of imaginary money. So you have what you had originally and you can play Monopoly.

302
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:11,840
And now from that point, when you do another time step, it does the same thing. It takes the vector that you've newly landed on and it rotates it 90 degrees, okay, and then you take a little step based on that.

303
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:25,040
And then again, you take a little step based on that. Where at each point you're looking at what is your money number that has some real part and some imaginary part, you rotate it 90 degrees and you add a little step on that.

304
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:33,720
And now the question is what happens to this? This is the original question. The bank offers you this interest rate, what's it going to do?

305
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:42,860
The correct answer, I think, is that you need to ask the bank for more information because how frequently you compound it is going to make a difference.

306
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:52,280
So to illustrate this, let's say you compounded it annually, meaning at the end of every year you take a big step that's based on this interest rate multiple.

307
00:33:52,280 --> 00:34:05,500
So for every dollar that you have, if you started out just putting your real money into the bank, at the end of the year you would add i times that amount, which is a 90 degree rotation of your money.

308
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,720
Again, I know this is utter nonsense, but follow along with me. One, it's fun, and two, it leads to real physics.

309
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:22,060
So where does that get you? Well, it gets you $1 plus i dollars. So if you had $100 in the bank, you end up with $100 real dollars and $100 imaginary dollars.

310
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:30,280
But then, after the next year, you take another step, where it takes that new money vector, rotates it 90 degrees, and adds that to where you are.

311
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:36,880
So after two years, you come back to your bank and you say, how's my money doing? And they say, good news, sir, there's twice as much of it.

312
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,280
You say, that's fantastic, it's only been two years. And they say, bad news, it's all imaginary.

313
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,280
So, very good for your Monopoly game, not great for life logistics. But it gets worse.

314
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:55,600
As you wait more time, and you add another 90 degree rotation of where you currently are, you're going to step into the negative real territory.

315
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:04,100
So at this point, now you have negative 200 real dollars, but you still have that 200 imaginary dollars.

316
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,540
So, good for your Monopoly game, devastating now for your actual life. But it gets worse.

317
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:19,500
As we take another step, four years later, after you've invested your hard-earned money, you've not even invested, you weren't even putting it at risk, it was just a savings account.

318
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,380
And where do you end up? For every dollar you put in, you would now have negative four dollars.

319
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,200
So you come to the bank and they say, well, you owe us $400 for the $100 that you put in four years ago.

320
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,640
And just as you're about to get outraged at them, they say, sir, we encourage you to wait. We really do think this is going to work out for you.

321
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,660
If you just let your money sit, do its work, and in the long run this will work out for you.

322
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,940
And they're not entirely wrong, because if you keep playing this game of rotating 90 degrees and then adding that vector,

323
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:56,680
after a total of eight years, where you're going to end up is at 16 times your original amount. Not too bad.

324
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,860
So if you're willing to put up with a lot of stress going in, changing your monopoly game, changing your real life,

325
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:11,520
and you were willing to just hold for eight total years, you would have 16 times as much. So that's pretty good, I would say.

326
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,440
We might call this the venture capitalist approach, where you put in your money, you can't see it for a long time,

327
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,320
and most of the time it's completely imaginary. But every now and then you get a giant multiple at the end.

328
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,100
Now before you excitedly do this, though, let's say that your bank doesn't compound it annually, right?

329
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,140
And they say, ah, actually we compound your interest continuously. Meaning that our time steps are not delta t of one year,

330
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,340
but it's delta t getting smaller and smaller. Well what that means is that each one of your steps that's perpendicular to where you are

331
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,640
is really just a tiny little step. And I'm showing with the arrows here what happens if you wait eight total years.

332
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:58,360
So you take a tiny step that's perpendicular to where you are, another tiny step that's perpendicular to where you are, and you keep going.

333
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:06,560
But as that time step gets smaller and smaller, smaller and smaller and smaller, to the point where it's genuinely continuously compounding interest,

334
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,980
what it means is that you're simply walking around a circle. So if you were writing this out as an expression,

335
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:22,000
you know, it might seem halfway reasonable to look at the fact that we were using e to the x as a shorthand for this limiting value here.

336
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,980
And in the case of real numbers that makes total sense when we plug in a value for x.

337
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:35,800
But what it means here is with our imaginary money, we're writing it as e to the i, that was our interest rate, times the amount of time.

338
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:46,280
Nonsense if we think about repeated multiplication, but in the context of compounding interest, all it really means is that after taking a bunch of steps that are perpendicular to your current position,

339
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:52,320
and we do that continuously, so those time steps are just infinitesimal, it has you walking around a circle.

340
00:37:53,260 --> 00:38:01,440
So, the bank offers you this, do you take it? Well let's think it through. What happens when you put in $100 to your savings account?

341
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:09,880
Well if you wait a total of pi halves years, which is the distance along a quarter of a circle, a little over a year and a half,

342
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:19,280
you come back into your account and what do you see? Well, for each dollar you put in, you have an imaginary dollar. Not great.

343
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,860
But you push through, you know, the banker told you that this will work out in the end, so you say, okay, I'm gonna wait.

344
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:33,300
I didn't need it for that year and a half, life wasn't going too terribly, so I'm just gonna let my money still sit in that savings account for another year and a half or so.

345
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,380
And you wait a total of pi years, around 3.14 years. You come back, and now it really doesn't look good.

346
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,180
Now, you've got negative one dollar for each dollar that you originally put in.

347
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:52,120
And just like before, you're infuriated at the bank, not as much as you were, because it hasn't gone out to be negative four, but it's still negative, and that's not fun.

348
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,480
And the bank says, hold on, hold on, sir, we think this is actually gonna work out for you in the end.

349
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,120
You say, okay, I've seen this work out for my friends who got 16 times their money, so I'll just hold.

350
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,460
And you do, you just don't touch the money in your savings account, you wait another year and a half and you check.

351
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:14,560
And now, not only is it entirely imaginary, it's negative. So you can't live your real life, and you also can't even play Monopoly well.

352
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,660
So, 4.7 years is a real low during this whole experience.

353
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:28,200
But if you're willing to stick it out, and wait a total of 6.28 years, 2 pi years, you come back, and for all of your stress, you're back to where you started.

354
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,280
You just have one dollar for every dollar that you put in originally.

355
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:41,360
So, should you accept this interest rate from your bank? Depends on how much emotional turmoil you want, but if it's continuously compounding, certainly not, I think is the appropriate answer.

356
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:55,840
Now, is this at all useful? This is kind of fun, I think, to take an idea that started off only relevant to real numbers, you know, a 12% interest rate, or if you have negative interest rates, you can think of how that decays.

357
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,920
And say, well, what if we did something else to it? What if each time step wasn't in the direction, but it was perpendicular to the direction?

358
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,840
And the answer is that this is actually incredibly relevant to anything that involves what's called simple harmonic motion in physics.

359
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,100
And so a great example of this is a spring. Let's say we wanted to understand the motion of a spring.

360
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,800
So let me pull this up here.

361
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,540
I think I have an actual spring sitting somewhere here, if it didn't roll off my table.

362
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,200
I had trouble finding any reasonable ones, so I tried to just extract one from my pen.

363
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,080
Maybe not the greatest physics demo in the world, but I've got one.

364
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,600
So the idea here is that if I pull the spring, it's pushing me back in the other direction against how I pull it.

365
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,460
And similarly, if I push on it, then it's pushing me in the other direction. It's trying to get back to that equilibrium point.

366
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:57,460
And the way that it does this obeys, at least to a loose approximation for a lot of springs, something called Hooke's law.

367
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,440
So if I draw out a spring, and let's imagine that there's some mass sitting at the end of it.

368
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:17,180
Let's say that this is where it wants to be. This is the equilibrium position, kind of like how my spring is sitting here before it just rolls away with no forces acting on the mass.

369
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:33,380
But if you stretch it out, if I pull it, that same mass at the end, this distance, what we might call the displacement of our mass, ends up influencing how much force the spring is pulling back on.

370
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,500
Because intuitively we know that the spring is pulling back with some kind of force.

371
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,040
And what Hooke's law suggests is that it's a force proportional to that size of x.

372
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,780
And we use k as a proportionality constant and negative to emphasize that it's pointed in the opposite direction.

373
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:56,260
So in this context, what we're saying is if we double the amount that we're pulling it, it's going to pull us back with twice the force.

374
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,760
If we triple it, it pulls us back with three times the force.

375
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,160
As with any kind of physical models, this is only true to an approximation.

376
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,680
You know, if we pull the spring such that we just distort it entirely, this certainly won't apply.

377
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:16,320
And often with anything that involves the simple harmonic motion we're about to describe, it tends to only be true for small variations.

378
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,200
And as you get larger variations, the model would have to change.

379
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,180
But this is a pretty good one, and it's very general. It comes up in a lot of different circumstances.

380
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Now force is mass times acceleration. This is what force is. This is what Newton's second law tells us.

381
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,680
It says, what is your mass? I'm telling you how much you're going to accelerate.

382
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,360
Acceleration is how much your velocity changes, velocity being how much the value of x changes.

383
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:55,260
Now this is quite interesting, because what it means is that acceleration, which is influencing the displacement, kind of in a second order way via how it influences velocity, is itself influenced by the value of x.

384
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,600
So I'm going to go ahead and ask you a quiz question here.

385
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:05,460
It's basically to have us think about what velocity and acceleration really mean in a context like this.

386
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:12,780
So we'll pull up our quiz again. We are going to go to the final live question for this lesson.

387
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,980
Which is a big one, but it's largely just stating what I just did.

388
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,200
A mass on a spring is pulled a distance x away from an equilibrium point.

389
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:31,140
If the spring obeys Hooke's law, the mass will experience a force of f equals negative kx, x being that displacement, for some constant k.

390
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:37,240
Keep in mind, by Newton's second law, f equals ma, where m is the mass and a is the acceleration.

391
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:53,040
If the mass starts out with a displacement of x naught and a velocity of v naught, which of the following most clearly describes the changes of these values after a small change in time, delta t?

392
00:43:53,620 --> 00:44:08,420
Okay, so we're going to let time play out for a tiny step in time, and it wants us to know which of these four options best describes what that change to the x value is going to look like, delta x, and what the change to the velocity value will look like, delta v.

393
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,780
So I'll give you a little bit of time for this one.

394
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:51,480
While you're thinking about that, we've got another question in about quaternions, not entirely relevant to the lesson, but certainly a very interesting idea and question.

395
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:59,200
So if you're enjoying this kind of side plot to the full lecture, rotation in 2D requires one extra number, i.

396
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:11,040
So why is it that it requires three extra numbers, i, j, k, and not just two, i and j, for 3D rotation? Is there an equivalent way for rotation in four dimensions, and how many extra numbers are required there?

397
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:23,440
Okay, awesome question. So a way to think about this, in complex numbers or in two dimensions, you only need one degree of freedom to describe rotation, okay, you just need to describe the angle that you're rotating.

398
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,680
And so you might say, oh, why do we need a 2D number system in order to describe something that only has one degree of freedom?

399
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:39,240
And the idea is that it's nice to live in a slightly bigger space so that we can have a circle, something where you come back on itself, and then we just constrain all of the rotating actions to that circle.

400
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:48,200
So the way that complex numbers describe rotation is entirely based on the numbers that sit on a circle. It's only one dimension's worth of numbers in some sense. Awesome.

401
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:56,660
So for three-dimensional rotation, it's not just two extra degrees of freedom you have, you actually have three degrees of freedom to describe any 3D rotation.

402
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:05,100
You might think of it as saying, choose an axis for your rotation, a latitude and longitude that you're going to poke a hole through the entire Earth.

403
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:11,880
And then after you choose that latitude and longitude, two degrees of freedom for your axis, you have another degree of freedom for how much you rotate.

404
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,480
So it's a total of three degrees of freedom to describe rotation in three dimensions.

405
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:32,060
Now again, you could say, in principle, we should be able to do this with a three-dimensional space, where somehow you associate the three degrees of freedom of 3D space with the three degrees of freedom of your rotation, which you kind of can with a thing called stereographic projection,

406
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:41,940
which is entirely what the video I did about quaternions was about. But, in the same way that to describe rotations, it's nice to have a circle, something that lives one dimension higher.

407
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:50,580
To describe 3D rotations, it's nice to have a hypersphere, basically something that loops back on itself, but it has three degrees of freedom on it.

408
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,620
Very weird for us to think about, but that's sort of the degrees of freedom argument.

409
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:06,620
And then four dimensions, rotations would actually have ten degrees of freedom. There's not a number system for it, but if you're trying to constrain your matrices and understand things like that, which again, this is, if none of this makes sense to you, don't worry.

410
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,820
It's not in the spirit of this particular lecture or the target audience for it. But it's an interesting topic.

411
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,160
And if it's what you're chatting about on Twitter, I'm happy to chime in on that.

412
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:26,540
So, yeah, thinking about degrees of freedom and the fact that it's nice to live one dimension higher to have, basically have a more interesting surface than flat Euclidean space.

413
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:39,020
Okay, with that as our changing scenes abruptly from the side plot of quaternions, we return back to our regular programming of physics and how it's relevant to imaginary interest rates.

414
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:47,160
Locking in our answers here, it looks like most of you correctly answered A. And what is A saying here?

415
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:58,080
It's saying that the change to x is whatever your velocity was times the small step in time, which that's what velocity is, right? It's saying how many meters per second.

416
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,240
What is the change in distance per unit time? So you multiply it by the change in time.

417
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:08,480
And then the only tricky part is knowing that the velocity changes based on acceleration times delta t.

418
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,460
And acceleration in this case, we can work out based on the various equations.

419
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:20,660
Not sure if you can hear, but there's some sirens in the background. In general, whenever I'm recording, it's so annoying when there's background noise.

420
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:27,840
So one of the nice things about live is that I just have no option. So background noise needs to be tolerated.

421
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:37,160
Anyway, if we want to write a pure expression for the acceleration, what it looks like is, just rearranging, negative k over m times x.

422
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:46,720
Now for where we're going with this, it's going to be a little bit simpler. This is a classic mathematician thing to do. Ignore the like real numbers.

423
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,480
And just assume that we're working with whatever units we need to, such that k over m is equal to 1.

424
00:48:53,780 --> 00:49:02,040
And then what we can say is that the acceleration is negative x. And the reason I want to do that will hopefully become apparent in a moment.

425
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,400
Now the way I want you to think about this spring setup is going to look a little weird at first.

426
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:15,380
I'm going to have you follow two different numbers, which is basically the displacement of our mass sitting up here, what is x.

427
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:24,740
But then you also want to know the velocity. So let's say it's not just up there holding still, it was actually moving a little bit with some kind of velocity to the right.

428
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,900
You need to understand those two numbers to follow the system as a whole.

429
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,780
And I'm going to package those two numbers together as a single point in two dimensional space.

430
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:43,600
So let's say I had some position, or some state I should say, that has a small displacement but then a large velocity.

431
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:56,500
I'm going to think of that as simply being a point, or maybe I draw an arrow to it, thinking of it as a point in two dimensional space, with coordinates x and v.

432
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,520
All I'm doing is packaging them together as a single point.

433
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:16,300
And then what we might write is that the change to our two coordinates, the change to x, v, looks like, well, the way x changes is based on your velocity times a little change in time.

434
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:24,660
That's what velocity is. And the way velocity changes, same deal but with acceleration. But acceleration is negative x for this system.

435
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,680
So it's going to be negative x times delta t.

436
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:38,960
So we have a value that changes, and in fact the way that it changes is going to be based on a little vector perpendicular to itself.

437
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,300
Which is what happens when you swap the variables and you make one negative.

438
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:50,780
And let me just talk through this, not in the context of writing them down as two separate coordinates, but in the context of imaginary numbers.

439
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:58,960
Which feels like a very weird thing to do, but just walk through with me this process because it feels so elegant once you let it play out.

440
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:08,540
I'm going to package this pair of numbers as a single complex number where the real part is the position of the spring and the imaginary part is the velocity.

441
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:15,720
Again, totally crazy thing to do. If that feels weird or you don't understand it, that's fine, it's not a natural thing.

442
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,620
But if we play this out and we start walking through the math, hopefully it starts to justify itself.

443
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:34,840
Because what I can write is that the change to this state, this complex number, is actually equal to negative i times itself.

444
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,840
Times x plus i times v times delta t.

445
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,780
Why? Well, let me expand this out.

446
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:51,060
When I take that negative i, negative i times x is going to be negative x times i.

447
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,880
Negative i times iv is going to be negative i squared times v.

448
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,320
i squared is negative 1, so that's just going to end up being v.

449
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,360
So it's that whole number times our delta t.

450
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:11,580
What is this saying? It says the change to the real part corresponds to v, the velocity, which is what we saw up here.

451
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,160
The change to the first coordinate is based on v.

452
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,000
And the change to the imaginary part is based on the negative of the real part.

453
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:25,360
The change to your velocity, the acceleration, what corresponds to force, is based on negative x.

454
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:36,560
So this weird idea of Hooke's Law, where the force that the spring is pulling on turns out to be in the same, against the direction of displacement and proportional to displacement,

455
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,220
lends itself to a very strange but natural description of our system with a complex number.

456
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:50,360
And I could write this even more compactly by saying, let's describe our whole state with a number z.

457
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:59,580
The way that z changes is equal to negative i times itself times a small step in time.

458
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:11,180
Geometrically, what that looks like is taking wherever you started, multiplying it by negative i, which rotates at 90 degrees, so this is a 90 degree angle, and then taking a little step.

459
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:21,080
And then now you're at a new state, and you rotate that new state by 90 degrees, scale it down by delta t, whatever your time step is, and you take another step.

460
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:31,580
And you take another step. And you keep doing this, and just like what we saw earlier for compound interest that was imaginary, what you end up doing is walking around a circle.

461
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:38,000
Now this is maybe the worst attempt at a circle I've ever drawn. This should go out a little bit further, something like that.

462
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Ignore my dotted lines there.

463
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,960
Now let's gut check to see if this intuitively makes sense that that's what our spring would do.

464
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,880
Because this vertical axis is the velocity.

465
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:58,260
So what we're saying is if you start off with a high velocity and a low displacement, so your spring, your mass is moving fast, but it's not that far away from the equilibrium point,

466
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,180
well yeah, x is going to increase, because that's what it means to be moving fast.

467
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,000
So the x component, the real component here, is getting bigger and bigger.

468
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,160
And in the meantime, the y component, the velocity is slowing down, because the spring is pulling it back.

469
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:20,060
So our y component is getting smaller and smaller, until we reach a point where there's no velocity, and it's as far out in the x component as it can go.

470
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,740
So we've kind of swung out, and then it's as far out as it can go, and then it's going to start turning around.

471
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,440
The x component is going to start decreasing, and the velocity is negative.

472
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:37,740
And in general, this is just going to walk around a circle in our complex plane, where the use of a complex plane feels kind of bizarre here.

473
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,700
But maybe intuitively, that's not that crazy a thought.

474
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,000
Whatever piece of math is describing the physics of a spring that goes back and forth,

475
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,100
and critically I should specify this is a spring where we're not taking into account friction, so it'll just oscillate back and forth forever,

476
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,740
that oscillation corresponds with circular motion.

477
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,220
And we can see this maybe even more concretely if we write out the math of it.

478
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:09,240
So what we just saw is that imaginary compound interest invites us to write the solution, the place that we're going to be after an amount of time t,

479
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,980
as wherever we were in the beginning, times e to the power of that interest rate,

480
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,360
where in this case the interest rate is negative i.

481
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:24,220
The thing influencing how you change, it's not in the direction of where you are, it's 90 degrees to where you are, times the time.

482
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:32,340
This is actually a reasonable way to write things, and it mirrors how you might see things written in certain parts of actual physics.

483
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,440
This e to the i t term shows up any time you have this kind of oscillation,

484
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:41,040
and the oscillation often corresponds to forces that are proportional to the displacement itself.

485
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,040
It all loops together, it's all connected.

486
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:49,920
Now if you wanted to make this, I don't know, connect with the kind of graphs and functions that we see elsewhere,

487
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:58,700
you could write this using Euler's formula, writing the expansion of the fact that e to an imaginary constant walks around a circle,

488
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:09,360
as your initial state times the cosine of t, and minus i times the sine of t.

489
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:17,700
And what this is basically saying is if we were to independently graph the displacements and the velocities,

490
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,540
they would look like sine waves.

491
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,420
Okay, so I'm just going to draw out a couple different plots here,

492
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,220
where on each one I'm going to let the x-axis represent time that we're moving forward,

493
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,460
and in one of them we're going to plot the displacement.

494
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,760
Well let's say the displacement started off entirely at one and the velocity was zero.

495
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:50,880
What it would look like would just be this cosine of t, excuse me, cosine of t real component of our weird complex number description of things.

496
00:56:51,500 --> 00:57:01,960
But if that all feels weird, hopefully it feels more concrete when you realize all that saying is that the position of the spring oscillates back and forth in a nice little cosine wave,

497
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,880
which matches physical intuition, it kind of oscillates back and forth in this gentle smooth wave.

498
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:20,100
And then similarly the velocity, let's say it started off at zero, what our Euler's formula is telling us is that this will end up being a negative sine wave.

499
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:28,500
So it's going to start off at zero, but then it's going to go down, basically because it started off, you know, as far as it could be,

500
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,760
and then it's going to point in the opposite direction, bringing the mass back towards equilibrium.

501
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,000
And then the velocity will reach some minimum and then it'll come back up until the velocity is zero.

502
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,740
This is when the spring goes all the way to the other end.

503
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:46,300
And then the velocity will be positive for a while and it'll keep oscillating back and forth like that.

504
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:52,820
And I'm sure I haven't quite lined up the waves appropriately, but the idea that each one of them is a sort of sinusoidal pattern,

505
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,200
and that they're out of sync with each other, hopefully lines up with some physical reasoning.

506
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:07,100
And I just think it's beautiful that what you can see is happening is it is two different shadows of circular motion in an abstract mathematical idea,

507
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:12,780
of packaging the two components as a real and imaginary part of some number.

508
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,040
Because this Hooke's law let us describe things at a 90 degree angle.

509
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,180
And all of that is actually deeper than you might think it is.

510
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:28,320
There's certain formalizations of classical Newtonian mechanics that introduce complex numbers for pretty similar reasons to what's going on here.

511
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,180
It's all a bit advanced, I won't necessarily go into it.

512
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:39,000
But what I want to emphasize is that this original question we asked of what happens if your bank offers you an imaginary interest rate isn't totally insane,

513
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:46,540
and in fact, at least it's insane for money, but it's not insane as an abstract idea to pursue, and it corresponds to some very real things.

514
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,800
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and take one final question from the audience, and then say my goodbyes.

515
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,680
So the last question we have for today.

516
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:02,240
Can we get some hints or thoughts on the last challenge from the previous lecture, particularly exp of x for matrices?

517
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:08,000
Excellent. That was a hard question, by the way, the homework that I left at the end of last lecture.

518
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:17,540
So remember, last lecture we were talking all about thinking of the exponential function as this infinite polynomial,

519
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:25,380
and hopefully today the fact that it came from our limiting expression, I didn't show why, but we could call that homework number two for today.

520
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:33,000
If you're really ambitious, it's showing that this expression that comes from compound interest ends up expanding to be this polynomial,

521
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,620
which is what we mean anytime we refer to e to the x in math, at least in modern math.

522
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:48,840
So I asked some questions on the homework that involved expanding this out all around trying to understand the crucial equation that

523
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:55,260
when you add two numbers in the input, this is the same as multiplying two outputs.

524
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:02,860
Okay. And then what we have on screen is asking about for matrices, what goes on here.

525
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:12,320
So the thing that again, this is kind of advanced and maybe I feel a little bit bad about that if I didn't properly emphasize it in giving the homework.

526
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:19,460
The thing I want you to notice is when you go through parts one and two of the homework where you're expanding it out,

527
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:29,540
and especially in the case of part two where you're expanding things out, to think critically about whether the commutative property,

528
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,880
x times y equals y times x, is needed or relevant.

529
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:39,040
Because often when we expand out binomial terms, it assumes that this is true.

530
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:44,160
And the reason that the math for expanding binomial terms looks like what it does,

531
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:49,860
the reason it works has everything to do with the fact that order of multiplication doesn't matter.

532
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:57,400
This is particularly relevant in part two where we're expanding this exp of x plus y.

533
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:02,680
And when you do that, you're going to run into these terms that look like x plus y to the power n.

534
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:12,160
And then the parts of that are going to end up looking like n choose k where this is the binomial constant.

535
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:19,360
So that's a bit of prerequisite knowledge. If you don't have the prerequisite knowledge, don't feel intimidated by these problems.

536
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,120
It just means that there's a little bit more to learn.

537
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,820
The only reason that this expansion would work is if you have the commutative property.

538
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:34,340
So it's very subtle. But what this means is that the whole line of argumentation to show this property doesn't work

539
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:40,340
if the things that you're plugging in don't commute with each other, where x times y is not necessarily y times x.

540
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:45,480
For complex numbers this is true, for real numbers this is true, but for matrices that's actually not true.

541
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,000
And this is one of the reasons, by the way, I actually think writing e to the x for this is a bad convention.

542
01:01:52,120 --> 01:02:00,520
Because you have this bizarre situation where when you have matrices, and this does come up, there's real math that's done where you are exponentiating matrices,

543
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:11,780
the notation inspires you to think, oh, I should be able to write this as, you know, exponentiating a times exponentiating b should be exponentiating a plus b.

544
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:16,260
But this is actually not true. This is not true in the case of matrices.

545
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,420
We talked a little about quaternions today in the side plot, it's not true in the case of quaternions.

546
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:29,580
So this convention of writing it as e to the x is incredibly confusing as soon as you start extending into the realms where it's most useful,

547
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,140
where you have this particularly powerful polynomial.

548
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:41,380
And I'm just, I don't know, I think that is a fact worth emphasizing, which is maybe why I wanted to sneak it into the homework,

549
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:51,360
only later realizing that, you know, if honestly my intention is to introduce people to the idea just at a high level that this e to the x function is more than you think it is,

550
01:02:51,360 --> 01:03:01,760
maybe jumping straight to the crazy idea of matrices and expecting them to notice the nuance of commutativity being relevant to the n choose k formula for binomial expansion.

551
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:06,220
Like, actually there's kind of a lot of advanced things that go in there if we're really dissecting it.
