  "input": "718 would fit into it and to do that let me draw myself a new graph here let's say have some kind of exponential and if i want to understand the rate of change okay the slope tangent to that point x the way we often think about it is think of two nearby points so another one that might be x plus a little constant times h and then we're going to look at the slope between those two points and consider what happens as h goes towards zero so if this whole graph was a function a to the x if we wanted to give a very direct look at what might the derivative of this expression be we can make an attempt to calculate it ourselves without depending on a pre-established fact handed down from on high that e to the t is or i guess in this case e to the x is its own derivative and then manipulate based on natural logs and such so what does this look like if you try to come at it directly well what you would say is that the change in the height of the graph divided by the change in the width the sort of rise over run dy dx looks like the difference in the outputs at those two values so the output at the high value which is x plus h minus the value at the low value a to the x all of that divided by the step in the x direction which is just of size h and the fact that we are doing calculus here that we have the little d's that is a signal to us that we don't just want this ratio for a particular value of h we want to consider what that ratio change in y change in x looks like as the change in x goes to zero and here i'm writing that change in x is h so it's a limit as h goes to zero of this expression and from here you can try to manipulate it a little bit and see what you might find the first step take advantage of the exponential properties to write this as a to the x times a to the h and what's nice about that is it lets us factor out an a to the x because it shows up both in the first term and the second so i could write this whole thing as a limit of a to the x outside of a to the h minus one all over h and this was the limit as h goes to zero all right well x has nothing to do with the h here so we're allowed to pull out the a to the x term itself as far as h is concerned it's just some constant rescaling the thing and the limit of a constant times a thing is that constant times the limit of the thing a times or a to the x times the limit as h goes to zero of a to the h minus one over h and at this point we're a little bit stuck we've found a very interesting fact which is that any kind of exponential e or whatever you want based pi to the x 2 to the x 69 to the x those have derivatives that are proportional to themselves but we want to understand this proportionality constant and i could ask you to guess just to see if you can get a feel for it in the context of one particular example so let's say that i'm choosing a base of something like two and i want to understand rates of change of two to the x our question asks us the limit below i guess it tells us it tells us a little bit about what it is the limit below is a number between zero and one so this is we're looking at two to a small value minus one divided by that same small value don't worry about calculating it exactly i'm just kind of curious if you guessed enter some kind of guess for what this value is and then round it to two decimal places so we can have some consistency so we'll give you a moment to just think of what it might be but don't think too hard if you don't want to it's it's totally okay to get this one wrong we just want to see what people think so looks like we've got a couple things coming in from the audience here which is always fun so robert points out that in french the notation reads logarithm and is wondering why this word is used i asked this on twitter the other day evidently it's in reference to a person i think john napier and so it's like in reference to him and then there was a truly terrible french pun about like an exponential and a logarithm walk into a bar and they order a beer and like who pays and the answer is that the exponential has to pay because the logarithm which anyone who speaks french will like groan and laugh at but that made me laugh a little bit um do i have a personal vendetta against e yeah yeah i do i think it's an overrated constant i think it's beautiful but i think it's beautiful in ways that aren't what people think they are um and i also think that i'm going to talk about this in a moment we should write we shouldn't write the exponential function as e to the x because when it's more general that doesn't make sense and i think it confuses people we should just write it as what it is which is a certain polynomial and just be honest up front rather than letting e like e has nothing to do with e to the pi i that's a frustrating fact it shouldn't be in there anyway um german here uh is normal for how you do maths on a ruled paper instead of graph paper uh i mean graph paper is definitely nicer but um i don't know this this was the paper that i just had on hand and in general if you want to make any comments or um questions about the lesson uh you can do so on

  "input": "69 now all of that was dependent on the fact that e to the x is its own derivative right there's one avenue that you could take here if you want to uh come up with a definition of e what you could say and this is totally valid is the number e is to define defined to be the constant such that this limit is one if that's the case then e to the x is its own derivative by definition pretty much and then from there you will get the fact that um anything else its derivative can be expressed in terms of the log base e of of itself that's one way that you could go um another avenue that you could take is to say that when we write e to the x this is actually shorthand for a certain polynomial i'm partial to this because i think this is an honest representation of the role that it plays more generally like when we start talking about complex numbers it's weird to me that in high school i saw euler's formula as the polar representation for complex numbers before it was ever really explained that e to the x does not refer to the repeated multiplication that it's a shorthand for this long polynomial you might give it another name like exp right and then that's something that it makes sense to plug in complex numbers to traditionally the way that you see the series in uh high school is you might go through a calculus class where you learn about e to the x being its own derivative and then maybe at the end of a second calculus class the fact that its own it is its own derivative in conjunction with a very wonderful topic called taylor series right so it being its own derivative and taylor series um like proves that e to the x must equal this long polynomial which is absolutely the case right if you have a function that is its own derivative and at the value zero it equals one um you uh you will find that it has to equal this polynomial an alternate approach that you could take if you wanted in setting the foundations is to say don't worry about taylor series start with this sequence as a primitive object and then something we talked about a couple lectures ago was because of a nice property that this function has which is basically that when you add the inputs basically this polynomial behaves like an exponential and you can prove that just from the polynomial itself without calculus or anything x of a plus b equals x of a times x of b and it's a very pleasing exercise to kind of work out the expansion and see that that works and the fact that that works we talked about this a couple lectures ago implies that the whole sequence looks like whatever x of one is raised to the x so what you could say is the number e is defined to be this particular sequence evaluated at x equals one and if you go that direction that's all well and good and it becomes a kind of substantive thing to talk about e to the x being its own derivative and it's one of the most pleasing exercises that you'll ever do because we can take a look at this and if you know how to take derivatives of polynomial terms well let's just work it out actually i'll turn over a new leaf so that it can be nice and cleanly seen it's really one of the most pleasing i don't know times that you'll have in a calculus class if you're just sitting you're looking at this particular infinite polynomial and you're saying i wonder what the derivative of this happens to be and all you need to know is the power rule for polynomial terms and you'll say that the derivative let me take d dx well the derivative of a constant uh ends up being zero the derivative of x is one so the derivative of x squared over two you know you might think of that two is kind of hopping down in front and leaving one less than itself so it uh it becomes two times x to the one just x to the one over two and those twos cancel so we're adding x x cubed over three factorial i might x cubed over three times two times one this ends up being three times x squared you know the exponential the exponent kind of hopped down and left behind one minus itself over three times two times one the threes cancel so we can see that that's actually the same as x squared over two factorial and in general each one of our terms as the exponent hops down it cancels out one of the things from the factorials below it and what we get is the exact same sequence but shifted which is quite nice and like i said the uh the traditional way that you see this series is that you're using the fact that e to the x is its own derivative in conjunction with Taylor series to show that it must equal this but if you start with this as a primitive and you say this is the thing that defines a special function for which we use the shorthand e to the x then it feels a little bit more contentful and quite fun to say that e to the x ends up being its own derivative and like we showed earlier that then lets you take the derivative of all sorts of other things which in turn explains why we adopt the convention of writing all of our exponentials as e to something times t as opposed to writing them all as a to something times t even though those are equivalent and often weirdly hard to appreciate so with all of that said we can turn ourselves back in the direction of natural logarithms because let's say i wanted to know the derivative of the natural log you might wonder why i want to know that but if i have a bit you know a deeper relationship with the natural log of x in terms not just of how it relates to these series but in all facets of math maybe we can then start drawing connections and if you build up that relationship by knowing things like its derivative it actually helps you come back and understand things like the alternating series we were looking at before so can we use the fact that e to the x is its own derivative to figure out the slope of a natural log curve well what that slope is asking us is to look at a given input x we consider a tiny step dx to the right look at the corresponding step dy up and we want to understand the ratio dy over dx now at this point which has some kind of output y what we can say is by definition y is the natural log of x now this is the same statement as saying e have i written this right y is natural yeah great so this is the same as saying e to the y is equal to x okay now from there i can understand the relationship between tiny nudges to x and tiny nudges to y by taking derivatives if i ask about you know some tiny nudge to the value x and the corresponding tiny nudge to e to the y well what it means for e to the x or in this case e to the y to be its own derivative is that the size of that tiny nudge is e to whatever the y value at that point is times dy and we're saying that that equals dx and what this lets us do then is express the slope that we want dy over dx if we just rearrange things it looks like one divided by e to the y so what this is saying is that if we look at our graph it's got some x coordinate some y coordinate and i want to know what the slope is this change to y over change in x i can't immediately express it in terms of x maybe but i do know whatever this value of y is if i take e to the power of that and then reciprocate that gives me the slope but of course what it means to be on our graph is that y is the natural log of x which is the same as saying e to the y equals x so this whole thing is the same as taking one divided by x so if i want to know that slope i can say what is your x coordinate take one divided by that and that gets me the slope of the natural log which is we've just gone through a process called implicit differentiation if you're not inclined to believe that this manipulation is legitimate that we can just move around the dx's and dy's like that i have a whole video about implicit differentiation in the calculus series that you can take a look at but the point for us is that we have a very nice fact that the derivative of ln of x looks like one divided by x and that's quite nice and it kind of passes a gut check that ln of x gets shallower and shallower as you go on which means the slope gets smaller and smaller and the graph of one over x you know what does that look like well at the input let's say we have the input one somewhere like here it'll be at one at the input two it'll be sitting at a half at the input three it'll be sitting at a third and in general it gets lower and lower and closer to zero okay so the idea that this would describe the slope of that you know something that gets lower and lower closer to zero seems to pass a little bit of a sanity check now the relevance that this is going to have to us will involve the inverse operation to differentiation so instead of talking about what is the slope of the natural log curve what i might do is ask about the area under this particular curve let's say take the area up to my stomach was just rumbling i don't know if that's audible on the microphone clearly gotta eat lunch before these things so let's say i want to understand the area up to n of something like this okay what that what that involves is taking the integral between one and our value n of one divided by x by dx now this actually looks quite similar in spirit the idea of adding up a bunch of things that look like one over x to what we were looking at earlier how much earlier i guess over here where we're adding up one plus a half plus a third plus a fourth on and on and already it gives a little bit of an intuitive instinct for why something like this sum would be related to natural logs because we now know that in calculus land natural logs are intimately related to the idea of one divided by x but i want you to think of this spelled out a little bit more exactly and so we'll pop on over to our quiz one more time second to last question for today and the question asks us all right we're gonna let s be the sum from n equals one up to capital n of one divided by n okay that's s and then we're going to let i be an analogous integral where we're integrating dx over x between one and n and it asks you to compare s and i okay i'll give you s and i okay i'll give you a moment to think about that so interestingly we don't have a ton of consensus around this one so there's only three options and we've got a nice split and as you guys know this is actually one of my favorite things when we do any of these lockdown live quizzes um is when it's not you know everyone hopping on to one particular thing but we have a division among folks and i think that's great i'm curious i'm curious actually what the uh what the answer is going to be here and in fact even if it's not been enough time to you know thoroughly think through i'm going to go ahead and grade it just so that we can see what it happens to be and a lot of these the spirit of it is that you kind of hazard a guess so feel no shame if you entered an answer and then it's not what turns out to be correct so in this case um the sum does in fact end up being bigger than the integral and the and it looks like uh 900 of you got that correct which is awesome and then um following that was people thinking that it was less and then to those in b thinking that they were identical you know that's uh that's a reasonable thought because they're such similar expressions but there's a picture that really makes the answer kind of shine out to us here which is if i look at the curve 1 over x which is what this white curve is it's 1 over x and then i'm going to consider a bunch of bars each of whose area corresponds to 1 over n for some value of n so for example for the value 1 this bar has a width of 1 and then the height is 1 and that means that right above the input 1 on its upper left corner it's hitting the graph now for the next term if i want 1 over 2 that means it's going to hit the graph above the input 2 since the graph is defined to be 1 over x so its upper left corner hits that and then the area of this bar whose height is one half is well one half because its width is 1 similarly this bar has an area of one third this bar has an area of one fourth and so what you have is a sequence of rectangles whose total area is going to be similar to the area under the curve definitely similar but you can tell that it's going to be bigger because some of the area is leaking out in this context we've got a lot of area leaking out from the first bar a little bit less leaking out from the second and on and on but as you go because the graph flattens out it becomes quite a good approximation once you account for the area that's leaked out there now something kind of bizarre is happening here where usually we think of these rectangles as being something like a Riemann sum that defines integration where we say oh we don't know what the area under a curve is but we like areas of rectangles so we use the rectangles to approximate the curve here we're going to do something that's backwards to that if we know calculus we do know the area under the curve it's very nice it involves the anti-derivative of 1 over x like we'll show in a moment what we don't know is the sum of the areas of the rectangles that was the sum that we were looking at earlier and trying to understand so here we're going backwards and using the area under a curve to approximate the area of a bunch of rectangles which i think is fun it shows that calculus has this back and forth it's not just geometry informing understanding of curves but it's an understanding of curves informing an understanding of geometry and number theory and things of that sort so what this means for us is that if we take a look back at our paper and we look at my much more sloppily drawn graph than the beautiful exact illustrations can give us if we want to understand that area taking this integral the task is to do an inverse derivative to ask what function has a derivative that equals the inside here if that's something you haven't learned about again calculus series take a look at the fundamental theorem of calculus video or even the first video in that series i think shows a little of an instinct for why you have this relationship between slopes and areas but what it means for us is that we take the inverse derivative which we now know is the natural log the thing whose derivative is 1 over x is the natural log and we evaluate it at the bounds at n and 1 and this notation where i kind of put brackets around it and then a number in the upper right corner and lower right corner means i take that expression evaluated at the top minus that expression evaluated at the bottom okay and that well natural log of 1 what is that e to the what equals 1 well it's 0 right pretty much anything to the 0 will equal 1 so this term goes away entirely and what we're left with is the natural log of n and what this means for us is if we were using our rectangles to approximate the sum or using the the integral to approximate those rectangles it's saying that 1 over 1 plus 1 over 2 plus 1 over 3 on and on up to a given bound is about equal to the natural log of n and more specifically if you were to account for how much area is leaking out here that area actually does converge as n toward tends towards infinity the area that's leaked out approaches a certain constant and it's a it's called euler's constant or the euler macheroni constant and it happens to be around 0.",

  "input": "577 so in the same way that pi and e are constants of nature this is another constant of nature also bearing euler's name and what it what it describes is the deviation between this sum often called the harmonic sum and the natural log of x a thing that is related to e so euler has really got his fingerprints all over the situation at least as far as naming is concerned in our little expression here so that's quite nice that's quite fun but that only answers one of the mysteries that we had earlier because if you'll remember i opened this whole thing up by talking not just about this series that grows like the natural log we also alternated it we went 1 minus a half plus a third minus a fourth and the claim is that that was the natural log of 2 so let's see if we can try to understand why that's true and i might i might actually postpone explaining the even more bizarre fact that this interrelates with primes in a certain way depending on how long i want this particular stream to go but let's at least finish off by understanding the alternating series because it's extremely satisfying so to do that let me just rewrite what our series looks like and this is one of those things where as i go through the answer it has a feeling of magic and sometimes not in a great way you might find yourself looking at how we go about this and asking how on earth would anyone ever come up with that and maybe after we plop it all down we can try to introspect and think about the reasonable ways that someone would come up with the following line of reasoning but it it is not unique to this situation it's kind of a useful set of tricks to be familiar with and there's a couple general principles in there the first general principle is that if we have a hard question in this case figuring out what this sum approaches bizarrely it can become easier if we make it more general you might think that making things more general would make it harder because you have to answer a more powerful fact but math does this bizarre thing where sometimes by trying to make it more general you actually make the problem more tractable which is quite cool actually because what it means is when a mathematician is motivated only by making their own life easier it has the strange effect of making their results applicable to a wider variety of circumstances so the way i'm going to generalize this again it might look kind of bizarre and unmotivated but run with me for a second is rather than thinking of a single value i'm going to put an x in here and consider this a function where i'm taking x over 1 minus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 3 on and on and on and i want to know in general what does this approach for various values of x and then i just have to plug in the value x equals 1 and like i said that might make it seem harder infinitely harder previously we just had to know one value now you're asking me to compute infinitely many values but if you know calculus you might recognize that the exponents of your polynomial terms might just play nicely with the denominators here and in particular if we were to take the derivative of this series it behaves quite nicely the derivative of x is 1 the derivative of x squared over 2 well that 2 hops down and cancels out the denominator so it becomes negative x similarly that 3 hops down and cancels the denominator so it becomes x squared and while you might not know why we're taking a derivative of something here and how that would be helpful for actually evaluating the uh the ultimate sum that we care about it is an interesting fact and it's something that is playful and fun that we've somehow simplified the expression by taking its derivative and the simplification is actually quite important because uh there's a um a well known fact within math that you can take a series where each term is the product of the last with a constant kind of product so here as we go from one term to the next we're always multiplying by negative x so to go from negative x to x squared you multiply by negative x and then similarly x squared to negative x cubed you're multiplying by negative x and when that's the case the series as a whole is going to approach 1 divided by or wherever you start but here we started at 1 so the thing you started at divided by 1 minus the thing that you're constantly multiplying by which is negative x so to give another example of what where this comes up is if we were to take something like 1 plus one half plus one fourth where each time in our sequence we are multiplying the last term by one half this will equal 1 divided by 1 minus the thing we were multiplying by which was one half and 1 divided by 1 minus a half ends up being the same as 2 and that actually kind of feels intuitive that if we take 1 plus a half plus a fourth plus an eighth you could even draw out a picture where let's say I've got a rectangle whose side length is 1 and 1 here I can say the 1 represents this area and then half represents this area and then a fourth represents this area then an eighth represents that area and kind of keep playing this game and eventually it'll fill an area of two now the more general version of that is this geometric sum which someone who's done a lot of problem solving in math is able to recognize kind of quickly which is why they might enjoy this series much more than they would enjoy the one above it so this whole thing ends up looking like 1 divided by 1 plus x great but what this suggests is that if we somehow take an anti-derivative if we somehow integrate this we might have an alternate expression for what the the initial sequence was okay so from here I'm going to go ahead and pose a quiz and part of this quiz is seeing who in the audience is comfortable with calculus and again if you're not calculus series go and check it out but what we have here is the question what is the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x dx okay I want you to evaluate that integral and I'll give you a little moment for this one so so and you know tell you what while answers are rolling in before locking it in I'm going to go ahead and just start describing the answer here so if you want to know the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x dx well we know that the anti-derivative of 1 over x is the natural log of x so it's going to be the natural log of that inside divided by the derivative of the inside that's kind of the inverse chain rule or something you can get with u substitution but the derivative of the inside is just 1 so you can check yourself that if you take the derivative of this you get 1 over the inside 1 over 1 plus x but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1 so it stays the same so then we evaluate this at the bounds 1 and 0 and what this ends up getting us is the natural log at the top which is 1 plus 1 minus the natural log of 1 plus x at the bottom which was 1 plus 0 the natural log of 1 plus 1 is of course ln of 2 and then we're subtracting off the natural log of 1 which is 0 so the proper answer here comes out to be the natural log of 2 and it looks like 1600 of you have correctly answered that so well done well done indeed and if you wanted to kind of visualize this in your head or get some sort of like gut instinct on which of those answers seemed loosely correct even if you didn't know how to calculate it immediately the graph of 1 over 1 plus x is going to look just like the graph of 1 over x but shifted to the left so it's actually going to pass through the input 0 1 and then we're looking for the area under here so you know that it's going to be an area somewhere between 0 and 1 probably filling up more than a half of it and the natural log of 2 is around 0.",

  "translatedText": "[第 577 章]与 e 相关，所以欧拉确实在整个情况下都有他的指纹，至少就我们这 里的小表达式中的命名而言，这很好，很有趣，但这只能回答我 们之前的谜团之一，因为如果你&#39;还记得我打开这整件 事时，不仅谈论了这个像自然对数一样增长的级数，我们还交替 了它，我们用 1 减去二分之一加上三分之一减去四分之一， 并声称这是 2 的自然对数，所以让我们看看我们是否可以尝 试理解为什么这是真的，我可能实际上会推迟解释一个更奇怪的 事实，即这与素数以某种方式相互关联，具体取决于我希望这个 特定的流持续多长时间，但让我们至少结束通过理解交替系列， 因为它非常令人满意，所以这样做让我重写我们的系列的样子 ，这是其中之一，当我浏览答案时，它有一种神奇的感觉，有时 不是以一种很好的方式可能会发现自己正在研究我们如何解决这 个问题，并问到底怎么会有人想出这个，也许在我们把它全部放 下之后，我们可以尝试内省并思考有人会想出以下行的合理方法 推理的过程，但它并不是这种情况所独有的，它是一组需要熟悉 的有用技巧，其中有几个一般原则，第一个一般原则是，如果我 们在这种情况下遇到一个难题，弄清楚这是什么奇怪的是，如果 我们让它更一般化，它就会变得更容易，你可能会认为让事情变 得更一般化会让事情变得更困难，因为你必须回答一个更强大的 事实，但数学会做这种奇怪的事情，有时通过试图让它更一般化 ，你实际上让问题变得更容易处理，这实际上很酷，因为这意味 着当一个数学家的动机只是让自己的生活更轻松时，它会产生奇 怪的效果，使他们的结果适用于更广泛的情况，所以我的方式再 次概括这一点，它可能看起来有点奇怪和没有动机，但和我一 起运行一秒钟，我不会考虑单个值，而是将一个 x 放在这里 ，并认为这是一个我要接管 x 的函数1 减去 x 的平方 除以 2 加上 x 的立方除以 3 等等，我想知道一般情 况下，对于不同的 x 值，这种方法是什么，然后我只需插入 值 x 等于 1，就像我说的那样可能会让它看起来更难无限 困难以前我们只需要知道一个值现在你要求我计算无限多个值但 是如果你知道微积分你可能会认识到多项式项的指数可能会很好 地与这里的分母一起使用特别是如果我们要取这个级数的导数， 它的表现非常好 x 的导数是 1 x 的平方在 2 上的 导数，2 向下跳跃并抵消分母，因此它变成负 x 类似于 3 向下跳跃并且取消分母，所以它变成 x 平方，虽然你可 能不知道为什么我们在这里取某个东西的导数，以及这对实际评 估呃有什么帮助，但我们关心的最终总和是一个有趣的事实，它 是一些东西这很有趣，我们通过求导数以某种方式简化了表达 式，这种简化实际上非常重要，因为数学中有一个众所周知的事 实，你可以采用一系列，其中每一项都是最后一项的乘积具有恒 定的乘积，所以当我们从一项到下一项时，我们总是乘以负x， 因此从负x到x的平方，你乘以负x，然后类似地，x的平方到 负x的立方你&#39;乘以负x，在这种情况下，整个系列将 接近1除以或无论你从哪里开始，但这里我们从1开始，所以你 开始的东西除以1减去你不断相乘的东西x 是负数，所以再举 一个例子来说明这种情况，如果我们取 1 加二分之一加四分 之一这样的东西，在我们的序列中每次我们将最后一项乘以二分 之一，这将等于 1除以 1 减去我们所乘的东西，即二分之 一，1 除以 1 减二分之一最终与 2 相同，这实际上感 觉很直观，如果我们取 1 加二分之一加上第四个加上八分之 一你甚至可以画一张图，假设我有一个边长为 1 和 1 的 矩形，这里我可以说 1 代表这个区域，然后一半代表这个 区域，然后第四个代表这个区域，然后第八个代表那个区域继续 玩这个游戏，最终它会填满两个区域，现在更通用的版本是这个 几何总和，解决了很多数学问题的人能够很快识别出来，这就是 为什么他们可能更喜欢这个系列，而不是上面的系列，所以这整 个事情最终看起来像 1 除以 1 加 x 很棒，但这表明 如果我们以某种方式采取反导数，如果我们以某种方式整合它， 我们可能有一个替代的表达方式来表达最初的序列是好的，所以 从这里开始，我将继续进行一个测验，这个测验的一部分是看看 观众中谁对微积分感到满意，如果你不会微积分，那么再一次系 列去检查一下，但我们这里的问题是 1 的 0 到 1 的 积分除以 1 加 x dx 是多少 好吧，我想让你评估这 个积分，我会给你一点时间如此，你知道在锁定答案之前告诉你 答案是什么，我将继续并开始在这里描述答案，所以如果你想 知道 1 除以 1 从 0 到 1 的积分加上 x dx 我们知道 1 对 x 的反导数是 x 的自然对数，所以 它将是内部的自然对数除以内部的导数，这就是逆链规则或你可 以的东西用 u 替换得到，但内部的导数只是 1，所以你可 以检查自己，如果你取这个导数，你会得到 1 超过内部 1 超过 1 加 x 但链式法则只是让你乘以 1 所以它保 持不变，所以我们在边界 1 和 0 处对其求值，最终得到 的是顶部的自然对数，即 1 加 1 减去底部的 1 加 x 的自然对数，即 1 加 0 1 加 1 的自然对数当 然是 2 的 ln，然后我们减去 1 的自然对数，即 0 ，所以这里的正确答案是 2 的自然对数，看起来你们中有 1600 人答对了回答说做得很好，确实做得很好，如果你想 在头脑中形象化这一点，或者获得某种类似直觉的直觉，即使你 不知道如何立即计算它，这些答案中的哪一个似乎是正确的？ 1 除以 1 加 x 看起来就像 1 除以 x 的图形 ，但向左移动，所以它实际上会通过输入 0 1 然后我们要 寻找这里下面的区域，这样你就知道它是将是一个介于 0 和 1 之间的区域，可能会填满其中的一半以上，并且 2 的 自然对数约为 0。",
