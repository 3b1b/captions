  "So, if you want to know the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x, dx, well we know that the antiderivative of 1 over x is the natural log of x, so it's going to be the natural log of that inside divided by the derivative of the inside.",

  "But the derivative of the inside is just 1, so you can check yourself that if you take the derivative of this, you get 1 over the inside, 1 over 1 plus x, but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1, so it stays the same.",
  4212.7,
  4223.36

 [
  "So then we evaluate this at the bounds, 1 and 0, and what this ends up getting us is the natural log at the top, which is 1 plus 1, minus the natural log of 1 plus x at the bottom, which was 1 plus 0.",
  4223.9,

  4247.74,

  4258.5

  "And if you wanted to kind of visualize this in your head or get some sort of gut instinct on which of those answers seemed loosely correct, even if you didn't know how to calculate it immediately, the graph of 1 over 1 plus x is going to look just like the graph of 1 over x, but shifted to the left, so it's actually going to pass through the input 0, 1, and then we're looking for the area under here.",
  4259.02,
  4285.22

 [
  "So you know that it's going to be an area somewhere between 0 and 1, probably filling up more than a half of it, and the natural log of 2 is around 0.69, so that actually seems about right.",
  4285.64,
  4296.78
 ],
 [
  "But what's quite cool here is that if we say that the, well I can just write it out again here, if I say I want to integrate this bottom expression from 0 up to 1, which is the same as integrating 1 over 1 plus x from 0 up to 1, I know that that should be the value 2, ln of 2.",

  4324.92

 [
  "Okay?",
  4326.04,
  4326.44
 ],
 [
  "But on the other hand, if I picture taking my antiderivative and getting this whole sequence here, and evaluating it between 0 and 1, what I'm doing is I'm plugging in the number 1, which gets me my alternating sequence, then I'm subtracting off the value of 0, which when I plug it in just gets 0, so evaluating this at 0 and 1 is the same thing as integrating the bottom expression from 0 to 1, which is the same thing as integrating 1 over 1 plus x from 0 to 1, which is the same thing as ln of 2, and hence that whole top thing ends up being ln of 2.",

  4361.34,
  4361.9
