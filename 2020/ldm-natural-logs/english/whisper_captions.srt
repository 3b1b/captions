00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Let's go ahead and open things up today with a question that might seem like it's incredibly unrelated to the title of the video.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,880
So if you guys go to 3b1b.co.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,180
Live, link is in the description. You've all been there for some of the warm-up animations.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,100
I want you to just make an estimate for the following question.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,280
It looks like a couple of you have already started coming in with answers here.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,340
Consider the numbers between 1 trillion and a trillion plus a thousand. Okay, so this range of a thousand integers

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,060
that's pretty high. Which of the following would you guess is closest to the proportion of these numbers that are prime?

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,920
So if you were to go through the painstaking process of, you know,

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,880
looking at all of those numbers between a trillion and a trillion plus a thousand, considering which of them are prime,

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,580
what do you guess is the relevant proportion there? So don't worry about getting it right or wrong.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm mostly curious where people's intuitions are on this one.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,460
So while we don't necessarily have to do those painstaking calculations,

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,060
I have gone ahead and written up a simple program that can do that for us.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,720
So if we hop on over to Python, it's not exactly the most sophisticated program for getting primes in the world,

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,540
but it'll get the job done for us. So if I type something like get primes between 0 and 50,

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,200
you know, we take a look. Okay, it's got 2, 3, 5, 7, all your favorite prime numbers between 0 and 50,

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,860
you're gonna find in there. But maybe you don't like that range. Maybe you want to look between a thousand and a thousand fifty.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,120
And there you go. There's the primes between a thousand and a thousand fifty.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
And there's fewer of them. In general, as you get bigger and bigger, the primes get sparser and sparser,

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,020
essentially because each one has more options for what it could factor into. You know,

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,620
if you're just doing the guess and check on something like 143,

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,240
you just have to check all the numbers up to around its square root.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,680
Whereas if you're checking around a trillion, you have to check on the order of,

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,480
you know, something like a million numbers, all the primes up to a million, whether or not they go into it.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,380
So you might think that when we, let's say we define the list where we're going to get all of the primes,

26
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,820
you know, get the primes between a trillion, which is 10 to the 12th, and a trillion

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,560
plus a thousand.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,300
This involves a lot of number crunching to actually find those primes. And you can see by the fact that, you know,

29
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,960
the program I wrote isn't going to be the most efficient thing in the world.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,540
It takes a little bit of time before it gets there.

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,400
So we can look at that list in just a moment.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,940
But before I want to properly take a look at what everybody thinks. And we have a great split!

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,900
Oh, I love questions that split up the audience like this. That's always fun. So what do you think?

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,540
What do you think is the actual density of primes up there?

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,260
Ooh, the correct answer is only third place. Usually in lockdown math, the correct answer is always at top.

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,400
So this is exciting for me. It seems like most, or

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,960
the largest number of people thought that D, one out of

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,420
250, that there would only be four primes in that range.

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,140
After that, it was people who thought only one in a thousand, that up there, you know, primes are so rare

40
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,840
they only come one in every thousand. The correct answer,

41
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,940
the closest proportion here, would have been one in 25. So a lot more frequent than people might have thought.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,780
And what's interesting is actually if you ask this question to a mathematician, they would be able to

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,160
pretty quickly tell you what the correct answer is, not because they're doing all that number crunching. And in fact,

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,320
if you were to talk to a mathematician, they would look at this problem,

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,420
they would do a small little calculation in their head and they'd say, the closest is one in 25,

46
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,040
but really it's going to be closer to, you know, one in every 27 or 28. That would be a bit more accurate.

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,360
You might wonder how they do that, because if we look at the number crunching that our

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,280
computer had to do, it had to check all of the potential factors for all of the numbers

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,660
we were looking at, and it does give us all of the primes between a trillion and a trillion plus a thousand.

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,820
So as you can see, they're, they're sparser than they are for just the numbers between zero and a thousand.

51
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,620
But there's a meaningful number of them. You know, we've got

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,920
one trillion seven hundred fifty one, one trillion seven eighty seven.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,140
The Boeing engineers are probably pleased that that's in there. And the actual length of that list is

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,000
37. So there's 37 primes in there. So the proportion out of the thousand is

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,820
0.37. Or the way we were phrasing it, it was one out of something,

56
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,640
so we might take the reciprocal of that and do a thousand divided by the number in there. And it's about one in every

57
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,040
twenty-seven. But what the mathematician would do is they would say, I know this very cute fact about prime numbers,

58
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,820
which is that the density of prime numbers near a given value, like a trillion, is around the natural log.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,580
So I'm going to type math dot log here, which takes a natural logarithm of that number. And we can, you know,

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,180
check if you want, what does the documentation tell us.

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,000
It says this returns the logarithm of X to a given base. If the base is not specified, it returns the natural logarithm,

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,840
which is log base e of X. And just as a reminder, if anyone needs a little reminding on what logarithms mean,

63
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,640
we talked about this all in the last lecture, so feel free to pop over.

64
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,400
But when you have an expression like L in X, which is telling us the log with base e of X

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,120
equals Y, that is saying the same thing as e to the power Y equals X.

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,000
It's asking the question e to the what equals X. So for example,

67
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,240
the natural log of 10, it's around 2.3.

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,440
And that's a kind of useful value to know if you want to make conversions between

69
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,220
exponentials written with e versus exponentials written with 10, but the natural log of 10 is around 2.3.

70
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,740
So that's saying the same thing as e to the 2.3 equals 10. Now the cutesy fact here is that prime numbers,

71
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,520
their density is actually kind of related to this natural logarithm. If we went over and we took

72
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,440
the natural log of a trillion, which was the number defining our range at the lower end of that range,

73
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,300
you'd see that it's 27.

74
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,120
And that was about the ratio we were looking at before, right? A thousand divided by the length of our list of primes.

75
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,500
I mean, that's quite close.

76
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,980
And the fact that

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,960
that happens at all is, I don't know, I might not call that my favorite piece of math because I use that term a lot,

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,520
but it's definitely going to make the list of top five favorite pieces of math. That the log with base e

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,980
has anything to do with prime numbers.

80
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,000
So I want to show you another kind of cute fact associated with

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,800
the relationship between natural logs and primes, because you might wonder why is it that we call this thing the natural logarithm?

82
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,880
There's lots of logarithms, lots of different bases.

83
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,240
What makes this one more natural? And I think the more often you see it show up in nature,

84
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,340
the more that name starts to kind of make sense. So I'm going to play a game that will seem truly strange for a moment.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm going to take an infinite series,

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,560
for example one that's, you know, a favorite among a lot of people. If you take 1 over 1 plus 1 over 4 plus 1 over 9

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,860
plus 1 over 16, and in general you're always taking 1 over n squared, and you add up all of those numbers.

88
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,640
If you keep adding and adding them,

89
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,100
they'll stay below a certain bound and they'll actually approach a certain number. And it was this open question in Europe,

90
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,460
it was posed in Basel by I think one of the Bernoullis for a while, like what is the number that this equals? And

91
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,740
eventually Euler, genius of the day, was able to prove that it equals pi squared divided by 6,

92
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,180
which is very beautiful, the idea that pi is at all related to

93
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,820
just adding up the reciprocals of squares. But it gets crazier than that. I'm going to play this weird game

94
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,980
that's going to kick out terms that don't look like prime numbers, keep the prime numbers, and then

95
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,160
also scale down ones that are sufficiently prime similar for us.

96
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I'll show you what I mean. So 1 is not at all a prime. We're not even going to include it.

97
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,600
2 is a prime, so I'm going to keep that 1 over 2 squared term. 3 is a prime,

98
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,300
so I'm going to keep the 1 over 3 squared term. 4, it's not a prime.

99
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,960
But I'm not going to kick it out because it is the power of a prime.

100
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,440
So I'm going to say that 1 over 4 squared term can stay, but because you're only the square of a prime,

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,700
I'm going to scale you down by a half.

102
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,920
It's kind of a way of saying you look sort of like a prime, but because you're only a power of it,

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,420
I'm scaling you down by that power.

104
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,300
5 is a prime, so we keep the fifth term.

105
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,300
6, not a prime, not a power of a prime. We don't like it at all. It gets kicked out.

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,540
7, we keep it, and you can sort of see where I'm going here,

107
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,200
but I'll write a couple more examples because it's such a bizarre way to manipulate a series.

108
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,700
You would think that this isn't going to get us anything nice at all.

109
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,200
8, it's a power of a prime, but because it's a cube, I'm going to scale it down by a factor of 3.

110
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,440
So I'm going to take one third of the eighth term.

111
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,500
9, it's the square of a prime, so I'll take one half of the ninth term.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,880
10 gets kicked out, we ignore it entirely.

113
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,680
11 stays as is, and on and on.

114
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,600
So each one of your terms looks like the power of a prime.

115
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,100
1 over pk, and because this series, we're squaring them all,

116
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,500
it's 1 over the power of that prime squared, but we scale it down by whatever that power is.

117
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,860
Now, because we've manipulated this in a pretty chaotic way,

118
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,400
I mean, the primes are distributed in a pretty random fashion,

119
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,620
you might think that this is completely uncomputable. It's just a crazy situation.

120
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,360
And it's going to be smaller, you know, for sure it's going to be smaller than the pi squared over 6,

121
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,640
because we left out the 1, we left out a lot of composite numbers,

122
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,220
and prime powers bigger than, with a power bigger than 1, we scaled down.

123
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,580
So it's definitely a smaller number.

124
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,920
You might be able to guess where this is going based on the title of the video.

125
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,860
What it ends up equaling is the natural log of what it was before, of pi squared over 6.

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,760
And that's not just true for this particular sequence of sums of squares.

127
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,100
There's a number of other formulas that get us something related to prime,

128
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,080
where we could, sorry, something related to pi, which is evidently related to primes,

129
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,260
in a way that's, um, I mean, you play the same game and you have this weird fashion of taking logarithms,

130
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,540
and not just any logarithm, the log base e.

131
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,500
So just to talk through what I mean in this other context,

132
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,960
if you take 1 minus a third plus a fifth minus a seventh plus a ninth,

133
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,400
and kind of alternate back and forth between the odd numbers, you get pi divided by 4.

134
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,220
I have a video all about this, Mathologer also has a video about it if you're curious.

135
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,020
Very beautiful why it's true.

136
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,540
But even stranger is when we play this game of keeping the primes and kicking out others.

137
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,140
So 1 we're going to kick out.

138
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,620
If we keep the third term, that's negative 3.

139
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,860
Then the 5, we keep that.

140
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,560
The 7, I guess it's a minus 1 seventh.

141
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,200
The 9, we keep it but we scale it down, because it's the square of a prime.

142
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,480
And in this case, because we're only looking at odd numbers,

143
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,760
it looks like we're keeping quite a few of them.

144
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,480
We have to get bigger before we kick them out.

145
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,300
So like 15, that gets kicked out.

146
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,640
17 is positive, it gets to stay as is.

147
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,780
19 gets to stay as is.

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,460
21 gets kicked out.

149
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,040
23 gets to stay.

150
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,560
So a very bizarre thing.

151
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,080
I mean now the pluses and minuses, they don't alternate nicely.

152
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,080
It's like minus plus, minus plus, minus plus plus, minus minus.

153
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,380
It's a, it almost seems like a random sequence.

154
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,940
25, we can scale that down because it's 5 squared.

155
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,480
1 over 25.

156
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,200
And this doesn't equal pi fourths anymore,

157
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,820
but it does equal the natural logarithm of pi fourths.

158
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,340
So evidently there's this relationship between taking logarithms with base e,

159
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,000
which is to say, answering the question e to the what equals a value,

160
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,520
and these sort of prime patterns.

161
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,560
And it's quite beautiful when you think about it,

162
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,820
because if you look at like this entire sequence up here,

163
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,120
it's going to equal some number such that e to that number is related to pi.

164
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,200
So you have this formula that's interrelating all of the prime numbers,

165
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,560
and their powers for that matter, excluding the composite,

166
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,400
so it's still a cool sequence, it's not just like all the integers.

167
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,820
We're taking e, raising e to the power of that sum,

168
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,420
and you get something related to pi.

169
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,640
I mean, clearly better than Euler's formula.

170
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,720
I think you'd have to agree.

171
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,760
So, we might at the end of the lesson get to why that's true.

172
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,340
It'll depend on how much time there is.

173
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,880
But the next two facts I'll show you, we will definitely explain why they're true.

174
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,700
So we're going to play a couple more games with series here.

175
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,220
These ones are going to be a little bit simpler facts to think about than the first two that I showed.

176
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,960
But the relation with primes is just,

177
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,860
oh man, if that doesn't make you love math, I don't know what would.

178
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,060
But if we played an alternating game that doesn't go through all the odd numbers,

179
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
but it goes through every number.

180
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,680
So I'm going to take 1 minus a half plus a third minus a fourth, on and on.

181
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,780
And you might visualize this with a number line, where I'm going between 0 and 1 here.

182
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,280
When we take 1 minus a half, you're hopping backwards by a half.

183
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,940
And then plus a third, you're hopping forward by a smaller amount.

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,260
Minus a fourth, you hop backwards by a still smaller amount.

185
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,680
Then plus a fifth, and then backwards might get you here,

186
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,440
and then forward might get you something like that.

187
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,960
And you're alternating back and forth, and because each one is smaller than the last,

188
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,540
you can probably see that it has to zero in on some kind of value.

189
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,560
And as a matter of fact, it does.

190
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,460
It zeroes in on a value that's around 0.69 or so,

191
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,320
and more precisely, it comes in on the natural log of 2.

192
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,760
The answer to the question, e to what is equal to 2.

193
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,220
Kind of strange, don't you think?

194
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,140
That something like e would show up with relation to just odd numbers oscillating back and forth like this.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,580
And there's another relation that natural logarithms have to a sequence that looks like this.

196
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,660
You might ask, what happens if we don't alternate back and forth, but we add them all together?

197
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,360
What does that approach?

198
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,440
Because in the same way that, you know, when we added all the squares,

199
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,440
the sum of the reciprocals of the squares, that approached a beautiful thing, it was pi squared over 6,

200
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,720
you might think an even more natural question to ask is, don't square them at all.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,480
Take 1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth, on and on, what does this approach?

202
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,120
Now as it happens, it actually, it doesn't approach anything.

203
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,760
No matter how small a number you choose, this sequence is eventually going to get bigger than it.

204
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,640
So I could say, keep adding terms and eventually you'll get bigger than 100.

205
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,540
If you have some patience, keep adding terms and eventually you'll get bigger than a million.

206
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,180
And that's kind of surprising, because each one of these numbers is getting smaller and smaller,

207
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,420
so as you're making your additions, you would think it's going to slow down, it won't get you past something like 100.

208
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,100
But I can explain to you why this is going to happen, it's actually a very pretty proof.

209
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,280
If I group my terms appropriately, so I'm going to group a third and a fourth together,

210
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,460
I'm going to group all the numbers between a fifth and an eighth,

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
all of the numbers between a ninth and a sixteenth,

212
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,480
all of the numbers between 1 over 17 and 1 over 32.

213
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,620
So into these groups that grow in size by powers of 2,

214
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:43,380
what I can say is that a third plus a fourth, well both of those numbers are bigger than a fourth.

215
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,620
A third is bigger than a fourth, and, well a fourth isn't bigger, but it's exactly equal to,

216
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,600
but that does mean that their sum, yeah their sum is definitely going to be bigger than 1 fourth times 1 fourth,

217
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,460
which is the same as taking 2 times a fourth.

218
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,780
Similarly, this sum here, 1 fifth plus 1 sixth plus 1 seventh plus 1 eighth,

219
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,420
each one of those terms is bigger than an eighth.

220
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,440
All four of those terms are bigger than 1 eighth.

221
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,180
So the group of them together is bigger than 4 eighths.

222
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,040
Similarly over here, all of the numbers between a ninth and a sixteenth,

223
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,680
all eight of those numbers are bigger than 1 and 16,

224
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,120
so the sum all together is bigger than 8 times 1 over 16.

225
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,700
And you might see where I'm going with this, you know, here I have

226
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,920
16 numbers that are all bigger than 1 and 30, excuse me,

227
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,460
bigger than 1 in 32, talking while writing,

228
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,420
and of course all of these are just equal to one half,

229
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,780
so this 2 fourths is the same as a half, 4 eighths is the same as a half, 8 sixteenths, that's a half.

230
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,760
So in other words, what I can do is group all of my terms

231
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:01,940
so that the sum instead looks like taking 1 plus a half plus a half plus a half on and on forever.

232
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,880
And that you can see, okay, if I keep going sufficiently long, it is going to get bigger.

233
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,100
And it also gives you a little instinct that this might actually be related to logarithms,

234
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,480
because the size of our groupings grow according to powers of 2.

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,920
So if you were wondering, how long do I have to go before the sum gets bigger than 10,

236
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,180
you might have the instinct that, hmm, I'm going to have to add together,

237
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,960
let's see, I have 1 and then the rest of them are halves,

238
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,460
so I'm going to have to add together 18 different groups that each look like a half,

239
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,260
so I might have to get up to the point where the size of my group is like 2 to the 17th or 2 to the 18th,

240
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,080
something like that.

241
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,940
And you would be spot on that it grows, well, it doesn't grow exponentially, it grows logarithmically,

242
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,640
because if you're asking how far do you need to go in order to get to that point, it would be logarithmic.

243
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,920
And as you might guess, it's actually the natural logarithm.

244
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:02,160
So if I add up all of the terms to about 1 over n, it ends up being approximately the natural log of n.

245
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,700
And if you want to get even more accurate, it's the natural log of n plus a certain constant,

246
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,740
this is a constant we'll talk about later on in the lesson,

247
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:17,220
but just for an order of approximation, this gives you the idea that you need to get up to around the natural log of n.

248
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,580
So I'm going to go ahead and pull up the quiz and ask you another question,

249
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,120
just to see if you've been paying attention so far.

250
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,340
So our question asks, which of the following is closest to the smallest value of n

251
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,460
for which the sum 1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth on a 9

252
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,340
you keep adding until you get 1 over n.

253
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,420
How long do you have to go until that sum is bigger than a million?

254
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,340
So remember, your first instinct here might have been that this entire sum converges to something,

255
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,340
in the same way that when you add the reciprocals of squares, it converges to pi squared divided by 6, very beautiful.

256
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,060
You might have thought that you keep going to this and it converges.

257
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,260
In fact, what happens is it'll always get larger, but you can be more quantitative than that,

258
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,680
and you can ask, how long does it take before this gets larger than a million?

259
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,100
So I'll give you a little bit of time to think through what the answer to that will be,

260
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:22,900
and I will say, because we're kind of converting between E-related things and base 10-related things,

261
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,900
if you wanted a little reminder, I can pull up the fact that the natural log of 10 is around 2.3,

262
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,800
if you wanted to use that for estimation purposes.

263
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,720
So just to see if you were paying attention to the result that I just described of this thing growing like a natural logarithm,

264
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,960
let's see how you answer.

265
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,340
And I'll give another 20 seconds or so here.

266
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,520
Alright, even if you're not necessarily finished, I'll go ahead and see where people are on this one,

267
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,240
lock in the answers, and then explain where it comes from.

268
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,440
So, the correct answer is that it's around 10 to the 400,000 or so, which is a huge, huge number.

269
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,120
The estimated number of atoms in the universe is around 10 to the 80th,

270
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,640
so it would be as if each atom in the universe had a universe inside of it, that would get us to 10 to the 160,

271
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,420
then each one of those had a universe inside it, that only gets us to 10 to the 240.

272
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,980
You'd have to keep iterating like that over and over, and it would even, even that crazy idea,

273
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:58,020
like mental thought for how you can get up to a big number, would take forever to get you to something of the size 10 to the 400,000.

274
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,760
Alright, now the way that you would think about something like this is to take a look at what I just said.

275
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,220
When we add up all these numbers up to the point 1 over n, it's about the natural log of n.

276
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,560
So what you're looking for is the value when the natural log of n is approximately a million.

277
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,000
That's how long you have to go before the sum gets bigger than a million.

278
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,860
This is the same statement as saying that n is about e to the power of a million.

279
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,980
Okay, but of all of our answers, we're expressed in terms of powers of 10,

280
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,740
so in order to make the conversion, I would think to myself, 10 to the what is equal to e?

281
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,200
That way I'm going to be able to make a little substitution in here with the power of 10.

282
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,020
Well, this is asking me what is the log base 10 of e?

283
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:58,100
And from properties of logarithms, like what we learned last time, this is the same as asking log base e of 10,

284
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,160
but we're taking the reciprocal of that.

285
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:08,800
Okay, and another way you could think about that is that e to the 1 over x equals 10.

286
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,860
That these two expressions are the same, so we're looking for the natural log of 10, but we take 1 over it.

287
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,080
Now our estimation for the natural log of 10, if you happen to know, it's around 2.3.

288
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:26,560
All you would really need to know for this one is that it's roughly 2, or even that it's on the order of 1,

289
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,040
because all the exponents in our options were looking very different.

290
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,420
So if you're asking what's 1 divided by 2.3, I mean very roughly, it's like a half.

291
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:43,920
So we could think of n as being very, very roughly something that's like 10 to the 1 half to the 1 million,

292
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
just to get us something kind of close.

293
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,000
So that looks like it's 10 to the 500,000, and we know that that 1 half really should be a little bit smaller,

294
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:00,260
because we're taking 1 divided by 2.3, not 1 divided by 2, so the number should be something a little smaller than 500,000.

295
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,520
And indeed, of all the options here, there's one that's much closer to 10 to the 500,000 than anything else,

296
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,760
so our very rough approximation would get us there.

297
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,140
Alright, so that's pretty fun.

298
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Now, to start explaining where on earth some of these things are coming from,

299
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,880
like why is the natural log present in these circumstances,

300
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,640
I want to take a moment to start talking about E and the role that E plays in math

301
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,140
in a way that I think sometimes it can be a little bit misunderstood.

302
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,360
So, just to start off, I'm going to pick a number from the audience, so in your own time, feel free to go to 3b1b.co

303
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,620
and enter whatever your favorite number is.

304
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,140
But the thing I want to talk about to begin here is how...

305
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,560
Ooh, lots of answers coming in. That's always fun.

306
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,620
When you see a family of functions, okay, so let's say we see something that looks like...

307
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,540
I'll pop on over here...

308
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,780
Something that looks like e to the r times x for various different values of r.

309
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,300
This is something you see all the time in engineering, in math, in physics.

310
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,000
We describe a bunch of different exponentials with some kind of parameter, like r sitting there.

311
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,100
And we say depending on what r is, this can give us a shallower exponential growth,

312
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,080
something that grows exponentially but a little bit more slowly, versus a steep exponential growth.

313
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,780
Okay? Once you're writing things in terms of a family,

314
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,200
I think a lot of people have this instinct that these are all of the functions that e produces,

315
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,420
like e the number is producing this beautiful family of functions.

316
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,220
But it's important to realize this is the same statement as creating a family of functions

317
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,020
that just look like a to the x with various different bases,

318
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,280
where it could tweak what that value of a is and say, you know, sometimes it looks like 2 to the power x,

319
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,960
sometimes it looks like 3 to the power x, or 4 to the power x.

320
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,740
Tweaking that base gets us various different exponentials.

321
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,160
That's actually playing the same game. For any one that you have here, like, you know,

322
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,780
the function 3 to the x, taking powers of 3,

323
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,280
I can choose an r such that e to the r x equals that.

324
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,880
And in fact, there's nothing special about e. I could have chosen as the base here something like pi.

325
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,500
I could say look at the family of exponentials that look like pi to the r times x.

326
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,720
It's not that pi is producing these numbers or pi is related to this family in a particular way.

327
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,260
It's a choice that we're making to write it that way.

328
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,160
And almost always, the choice that we make in physics and engineering and math all over the place

329
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,060
to write families of exponentials is with e.

330
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,520
So the right question to ask isn't what does e have to do with such a family,

331
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,720
but why is it the right choice?

332
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,020
I'll give you another example of where this can come up.

333
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,300
I mean, they're all over the place, things that look like exponential curves.

334
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,620
But one that's very important for probability and statistics is the bell curve.

335
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,820
So it's something that we almost always write in the form e to the negative x squared.

336
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,600
And a way you might think about this, by the way, is if we take just e to the x,

337
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,340
we get this thing that grows and it kind of decays as you go to the left.

338
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,040
And if we made it negative, it would decay as you go to the right.

339
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,200
So whenever the input to e to the x is getting very negative, it decays.

340
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,680
So to make it decay on both sides, you could take e to the negative x squared.

341
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,120
And then it's decaying on both sides and you get this nice bell curve.

342
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,260
And because of that square, it sort of smooths things out,

343
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,340
whereas if we had taken something like the absolute value of x but negated it,

344
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,080
okay, then it decays on both sides, but we get this awkward cusp.

345
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,740
That doesn't explain why this very specific curve comes up in statistics.

346
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,380
But if you ever kind of want to remember,

347
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,040
oh, what was the formula for a bell curve again,

348
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,740
you can kind of think through the fact that this should have roughly that shape.

349
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,560
And quite often it comes with some kind of parameters, though.

350
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,340
For example, I could put in something, maybe a value I'll call s in there,

351
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,740
that will determine how wide and skinny this bell curve is,

352
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,720
something like a standard deviation in the context of statistics.

353
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,120
S wouldn't be that standard deviation.

354
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,120
We would have to reciprocate it and square it and do some things.

355
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,260
But the idea that when you tweak what's in that exponent, it changes the bell curve.

356
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,160
That's the only point I want to make here.

357
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,360
You can think, just looking at this, that somehow bell curves are produced by the number e.

358
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,100
But that's not exactly true,

359
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,620
because I could also write a to the negative x squared,

360
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,860
and I get the same family of curves.

361
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,980
As I tweak the value of a, I'm also changing what that width is,

362
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,300
so I could come up with other ways of describing the standard deviation of this in terms of a.

363
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,460
And it's the same family of curves.

364
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,940
It's not just that they look similar. They are, in fact, the same thing.

365
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,420
And this is not too hard to show algebraically.

366
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,140
It almost makes it look a little bit more deceptively simple than it really is.

367
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,120
So we've got a lot of answers for what people wanted to enter as an example number to go with,

368
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,040
so let's go ahead and see.

369
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,980
It seems like the most popular answer, by a little margin above i, is 69,

370
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,340
which I assume is because if you take all of the natural numbers between 1 and 9,

371
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,820
and then you look at the divisors for each one of those,

372
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,160
you look at the numbers, you list all their divisors, and you add up the divisors,

373
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,820
it adds up to 69.

374
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,360
And adding up divisors like this is a very fun and common thing in number theory,

375
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,660
so I assume that's why people chose it.

376
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,640
But the point here is that if you see some kind of function like,

377
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,120
let's see, how should I write it?

378
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
69 to the power x.

379
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
I could also write that.

380
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,380
I could write the same thing as e to the power of the natural log of 69.

381
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,420
Okay, I've written that kind of sloppily. Let me do it again.

382
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,960
e to the natural log of 69.

383
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,520
That's the same thing as the number 69, right?

384
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,880
Because it's saying e to the what equals 69,

385
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,560
but then I've taken e to that, so I should get 69 back.

386
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,800
All of that to the power x.

387
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,680
And by the rules of exponentials, this is the same thing as e to just some constant,

388
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,620
whatever the natural log of 69 is, times x.

389
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,660
So I could replace that with a constant, which happens to be around 4.234,

390
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,540
as any mathematician will be able to tell you, well-known constant of nature, the natural log of 69.

391
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,060
And the point here is that this just looks like e to some constant times x.

392
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,020
So you might wonder, why do we make this choice, right?

393
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,760
Because it didn't have to be pi. I could write that same function, sorry, it didn't have to be e.

394
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,160
I could write that same function as pi raised to a special power,

395
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,740
namely the log base pi.

396
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,120
Man, I'm writing quite sloppily here.

397
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,380
Log base pi of 69 times x, that would be the same function.

398
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,340
We could describe everything with a base of pi if we wanted to.

399
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,400
And to just give one more example of where I think this, even though it's a, like it's a simple conversion if you know logarithms,

400
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,580
that anything that looks like a to the x can be expressed as e to something times that,

401
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,900
I think it's clearly not very appreciated that you can make that conversion,

402
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,740
because any time that we talk about imaginary exponentials,

403
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,580
and I get that it's kind of a weird thing to talk about e to the i times t,

404
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,380
once someone learns, you know, and I've made a number of videos in this series about it,

405
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,780
Mathologer has videos, lots of people have videos about it,

406
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,720
the idea is that e to the imaginary constant times some value t walks you around the unit circle,

407
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,900
and in fact it walks you a distance of t radians.

408
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,380
And the importance of this, the way that it comes up in, for example, electrical engineering,

409
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,760
is it gives you this oscillating pattern.

410
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,680
As you scale up t, you have something that's oscillating,

411
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,420
and it gives a very nice way to describe sine waves and cosine waves and signals that oscillate.

412
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,240
And there's actually one electrical engineer that I used to know, and he would always say,

413
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,700
oh I love the number e. What I like about e is it's the number that spins.

414
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,180
That's really what makes e special, I realized this. e is the number that spins.

415
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,840
But the problem is that's not, that's not exactly true.

416
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,220
It is true that e to the i t spins around, but that's not special to e.

417
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:58,860
I could also take 2 to the i times t, and that will also produce values that walk around a circle.

418
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,120
And we can think through more exactly, 2 is the same thing as e to the natural log of 2,

419
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,440
so 2 to the i t is the same as e to the natural log of 2 times t,

420
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,700
all of that times the imaginary number i.

421
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,820
Which basically means it's doing the same thing as e to the i t, it's just rescaling time.

422
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,380
It's walking a little bit more slowly.

423
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,880
And then similarly, if you were to take something like your favorite number to the i times t,

424
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:33,680
that would look like e to the approximately 4.234 times t, all times the imaginary number.

425
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,280
Which just means you're walking around at a different rate.

426
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
So e is not the number that spins.

427
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,560
The idea of complex exponents walking around a circle doesn't have to do with e per se,

428
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,280
it really just has to do with a lot of what we talked about I think in lectures 4 and 5.

429
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,280
And I'll go over it again in just a moment here as a quick reminder.

430
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,260
So the thing that's special about e, the reason that we always choose to write things in this way,

431
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,340
has to do with rates of change.

432
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:10,640
That when you take the derivative of e to the power t, this is the same thing as itself.

433
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:19,820
Which is to say if we were to graph this, you know maybe e to the t represents an amount of money you have over time or something like that.

434
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,360
And we were to look above a value of t, the slope of this graph, the rate at which it's increasing,

435
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,580
is actually equal to its own height.

436
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,840
So the farther you are along the curve, meaning you have a greater height, the steeper it is.

437
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,480
So the more money you have, the faster it grows.

438
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,740
This is the power of compound growth.

439
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,100
But that's actually true of any exponential.

440
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,960
What makes e special is that they're exactly the same, it's not just that they grow in proportion with each other.

441
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,860
So if we were to write a family of exponential curves as e to the r times t,

442
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,760
as opposed to writing it as a to the power t, and thinking of changing that value a,

443
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,340
the value in doing that is that taking the derivative by the chain rule,

444
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,520
we take the derivative of the inside, which looks like r, and we multiply by the derivative of the outside, which is e to the rt.

445
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,900
And if anybody here doesn't know calculus by the way, we're about to start doing a fair amount of it,

446
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,920
I have a whole series on it that you can pop over and take a look at, lots of other places on YouTube and such to give a quick primer.

447
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,760
But if you're coming in and you're not familiar with calculus, like just be warned that that's where we're about to start going.

448
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,360
Because if you want to understand natural logarithms, and by extension the number e,

449
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,480
the importance that they have has everything to do with rates of change and the inverse of that operation, as you'll see.

450
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,600
So anyway, why would it be nice to express a function like this?

451
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,200
Well what it's telling you, let's say this was something like the size of your investment.

452
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,680
This is an expression saying how much money you have at a given point in time.

453
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,920
If you want to know the rate of change of that, how much is it changing per unit time,

454
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,240
it's proportional to itself, and r gives you that proportionality constant.

455
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,080
If r was 0.01, it's telling you that the rate of growth is 10% of the size of the thing itself.

456
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:13,880
So the choice that we make to write things this way is, it's basically a way to make all the constants involved more readable.

457
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,620
So if you're to look at these statistics associated with bell curves, and the way that we actually tend to write things,

458
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:29,240
the pattern ends up looking something like 1 divided by s squared, and sometimes that x instead of writing it as x.

459
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,080
Strange parentheses. I might say x minus m for some value of m.

460
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,800
Both of these terms end up having really nice readable meanings, where m,

461
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,440
this isn't specific to the e fact, but it's just a common thing you'll see,

462
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,860
m gives you the mean of the distribution, where this pile is, and s gives you the standard deviation.

463
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,980
And when we choose to write this family with e, it's giving those constants readable meanings.

464
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,820
And a similar thing happens with how we describe complex exponentials.

465
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,780
When we choose to write the idea of walking around a circle with e, it gives a very readable meaning to what this term t is.

466
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,500
It's saying, what is the distance that you've walked along the unit circle?

467
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,180
And you can actually understand this with derivatives pretty well, where if we say, what is the derivative,

468
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,620
what is the rate of change of some value that looks like e to the i times t,

469
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:29,320
by the chain rule, this is going to look like i times itself, e to the i times t.

470
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,780
Now what would that actually mean? That means that if you're sitting at some kind of number,

471
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:43,660
if this is your current value for e to the i times t, the rate of change is i multiplied by that value,

472
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,680
which is a 90 degree rotation of this vector. Maybe I would draw it like this.

473
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,440
This right here would give you your rate of change. So you might move that over and consider it a velocity vector.

474
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,360
So this is kind of like your velocity vector, this is kind of like your position vector, which I might write something like an s.

475
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,720
So what this whole expression of e to the i times t is essentially saying is,

476
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,880
whatever this does, if it's somewhere in the complex plane, at every given point,

477
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,200
the rate of change of my vector is a 90 degree rotation of itself.

478
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,020
And so that's why we're walking around the circle at a speed of one unit per second,

479
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,780
because the length of the position vector is one, so the length of the velocity vector is one.

480
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,380
And it's also why, if you were to look at two to the i t, it walks around at a different rate.

481
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:38,440
Because there, the constant is not just i, a 90 degree rotation, it's i times natural log of two.

482
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:47,300
i times something would mean that this, where are we, this operation here is not just a 90 degree rotation,

483
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,280
it's a 90 degree rotation and a scaling. So your velocity vector would end up looking a little bit shorter,

484
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,100
and you'd be walking around the unit circle more slowly.

485
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,740
So that's kind of the important thing to understand about e, the fact that it's a choice that we're making to write families of exponentials this way,

486
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,300
but because it is its own derivative, that ends up making these things play much more nicely.

487
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,780
Now, this lets us take derivatives of anything else if you wanted.

488
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,660
If you did describe your money's rate of growth with a to the t, to take its derivative,

489
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,860
you could first do a conversion, write the whole thing as e to the natural log of a times t,

490
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,000
and the reason you would is then when we're, I sort of squished my font here,

491
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,020
then when you're taking the derivative of that, the derivative of the inside is the natural log of a,

492
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,900
and then that's multiplied by itself, e to the natural log of a times t,

493
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,320
which you could then spell out even further, convert it back into a to the t.

494
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:53,840
So if you did describe all of your investments as a to the power t, which kind of feels more natural to a lot of people,

495
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,920
that oh, you might say rather than e to some investment rate times t, just think of 1.05 to the t,

496
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,720
and that describes something like 5% growth.

497
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,020
If you were thinking of that growth in a continuous sense, not year over year, what's the new percentage,

498
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,740
but moment by moment, what's the rate of growth, you would have to say the rate of growth is the natural log of that base,

499
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,620
which just feels a little bit more awkward. You could do it, but it would feel more awkward.

500
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,300
Now, all of this leaves open the question of why?

501
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:28,780
Why on earth is the derivative of e to the t equal to itself?

502
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,840
It's this very nice property, so you might wonder where this thing comes from.

503
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,160
And it really has everything to do with how you define the number e.

504
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,460
And this can be a little bit frustrating, where in some contexts you'll see people say, what is the number e?

505
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,160
Well, it's the number defined such that this derivative equals itself.

506
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:56,600
And then other contexts, you might find e defined in a different way that is very conducive to whatever the circumstance there is.

507
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,500
So you might wonder, okay, can we come at this a little bit more directly,

508
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,800
and try to understand derivatives of exponentials, and see why the special value 2.718 would fit into it.

509
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,160
And to do that, let me draw myself a new graph here.

510
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,560
Let's say I have some kind of exponential.

511
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:27,540
And if I want to understand the rate of change, the slope tangent to that point x,

512
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,340
the way we often think about it is think of two nearby points, so another one that might be x plus a little constant times h.

513
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,800
And then we're going to look at the slope between those two points and consider what happens as h goes towards zero.

514
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:50,360
So if this whole graph was a function a to the x, if we wanted to give a very direct look at what might the derivative of this expression be,

515
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:59,780
we can make an attempt to calculate it ourselves without depending on a pre-established fact handed down from on high that e to the t is,

516
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,700
or I guess in this case e to the x is its own derivative, and then manipulate based on natural logs and such.

517
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
So what does this look like if you try to come at it directly?

518
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,520
Well what you would say is that the change in the height of the graph divided by the change in the width,

519
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:21,980
the sort of rise over run, dy dx, looks like the difference in the outputs at those two values,

520
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,380
so the output at the high value, which is x plus h, minus the value at the low value, a to the x,

521
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,800
all of that divided by the step in the x direction, which is just of size h.

522
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:44,720
And the fact that we are doing calculus here, that we have the little d's, that is a signal to us that we don't just want this ratio for a particular value of h,

523
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,740
we want to consider what that ratio change in y, change in x looks like as the change in x goes to zero.

524
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,500
And here I'm writing that change in x as h, so it's a limit as h goes to zero of this expression.

525
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,580
And from here you can try to manipulate it a little bit and see what you might find.

526
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:09,280
The first step, take advantage of the exponential properties to write this as a to the x times a to the h.

527
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,260
And what's nice about that is it lets us factor out an a to the x, because it shows up both in the first term and the second,

528
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:25,160
so I could write this whole thing as a limit of a to the x outside of a to the h minus one all over h.

529
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,620
And this was the limit as h goes to zero.

530
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,660
Well, x has nothing to do with the h here, so we're allowed to pull out the a to the x term itself.

531
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:42,440
As far as h is concerned, it's just some constant rescaling the thing, and the limit of a constant times a thing is that constant times the limit of the thing.

532
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:53,120
A times, or a to the x times the limit as h goes to zero of a to the h minus one over h.

533
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,560
And at this point, we're a little bit stuck.

534
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:07,620
We've found a very interesting fact, which is that any kind of exponential, e or whatever you want, base pi to the x, two to the x, 69 to the x,

535
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,400
those have derivatives that are proportional to themselves, but we want to understand this proportionality constant.

536
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:20,060
And I could ask you to guess, just to see if you can get a feel for it in the context of one particular example.

537
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:26,220
So let's say that I'm choosing a base of something like two, and I want to understand rates of change of two to the x.

538
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,860
Our question asks us, the limit below, I guess it tells us, it tells us a little bit about what it is.

539
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,980
The limit below is a number between zero and one.

540
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,940
So this is, we're looking at two to a small value minus one divided by that same small value.

541
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,660
Don't worry about calculating it exactly, I'm just kind of curious if you guessed.

542
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:52,460
Enter some kind of guess for what this value is, and then round it to two decimal places so that we can have some consistency.

543
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,900
So we'll give you a moment to just think of what it might be, but don't think too hard if you don't want to.

544
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,420
It's totally okay to get this one wrong, we just want to see what people think.

545
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,620
Looks like we've got a couple things coming in from the audience here, which is always fun.

546
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:45,980
So Robert points out that in French the notation reads, logarithm l'imperillain, and is wondering why this word is used.

547
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:55,000
I asked this on Twitter the other day, evidently it's in reference to a person, I think John Napier, and so it's in reference to him.

548
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:04,460
And then there was a truly terrible French pun about an exponential and a logarithm walk into a bar and they order a beer and who pays?

549
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:15,620
And the answer is that the exponential has to pay because la logarithm n'imperillain, which anyone who speaks French will like groan and laugh at, but that made me laugh a little bit.

550
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,680
Do I have a personal vendetta against e? Yeah, yeah I do, I think it's an overrated constant.

551
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,580
I think it's beautiful, but I think it's beautiful in ways that aren't what people think they are.

552
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,080
And I also think that, I'm going to talk about this in a moment, we should write, we shouldn't write the exponential function as e to the x,

553
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,400
because when it's more general that doesn't make sense and I think it confuses people. We should just write it as what it is, which is a certain polynomial,

554
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,240
and just be honest up front rather than letting e, like e has nothing to do with e to the pi i, that's a frustrating fact. It shouldn't be in there.

555
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,340
Anyway, German here is normal for how you do maths on a ruled paper instead of graph paper.

556
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,740
I mean graph paper is definitely nicer, but I don't know, this was the paper that I just had on hand.

557
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:06,280
And in general if you want to make any comments or questions about the lesson, you can do so on Twitter with the hashtag locked down math, and those will be pulled up as we go.

558
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:15,680
So it seems like we have strong consensus on our guess here, which is people guessing that the correct answer to this limit is that it's around 0.69,

559
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:23,520
which I assume the reason everybody guessed that is because it's the correct answer, that this limit does in fact approach around 0.69,

560
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,500
and we could play with Python if we wanted to see that experimentally.

561
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,820
Python's kind of overkill here, you could do it with any calculator, but if I raise 2 to some small power, I get some kind of number,

562
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:45,160
and if I subtract 1 from that, then I get a small number, and if I divide it by the same small power, so here I have three zeros and a one, it looks like we get around 0.6931.

563
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:52,880
And if I made it a smaller value that I was doing, it seems to stay pretty stable around there, it's around 0.69314.

564
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,480
So congratulations to the majority of you who had the right guess here.

565
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:07,900
And in fact it's no coincidence that that's what it is, because like I said earlier, if you're taking the derivative, where have I written it? I've written it somewhere.

566
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:16,660
Sloppily as I want to do, I've written that if you take the derivative of something that looks like a to the t, the constant sitting in front is the natural log of a.

567
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:24,440
So for something like 2, you would be looking at the natural log of 2, which is in fact around 0.69.

568
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,760
Now, all of that was dependent on the fact that e to the x is its own derivative, right?

569
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,500
So there's one avenue that you could take here, if you want to come up with a definition of e.

570
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:43,160
What you could say, and this is totally valid, is the number e is defined to be the constant such that this limit is 1.

571
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,760
If that's the case, then e to the x is its own derivative, by definition, pretty much.

572
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:58,000
And then from there, you will get the fact that anything else, its derivative can be expressed in terms of the log base e of itself.

573
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,360
That's one way that you could go.

574
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:08,080
Another avenue that you could take is to say that when we write e to the x, this is actually shorthand for a certain polynomial.

575
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,380
I'm partial to this because I think this is an honest representation of the role that it plays more generally, like when we start talking about complex numbers.

576
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:32,620
It's weird to me that in high school I saw Euler's formula as the polar representation for complex numbers before it was ever really explained that e to the x does not refer to the repeated multiplication, that it's a shorthand for this long polynomial.

577
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:40,900
You might give it another name, like exp, right? And then that's something that it makes sense to plug in complex numbers to.

578
00:46:41,420 --> 00:47:00,000
Traditionally, the way that you see this series in high school is you might go through a calculus class where you learn about e to the x being its own derivative, and then maybe at the end of a second calculus class, the fact that it is its own derivative, in conjunction with a very wonderful topic called Taylor series,

579
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:11,840
right? So it being its own derivative and Taylor series proves that e to the x must equal this long polynomial, which is absolutely the case, right?

580
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:20,020
If you have a function that is its own derivative and at the value zero it equals one, you will find that it has to equal this polynomial.

581
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:29,340
An alternate approach that you could take if you wanted in setting the foundations is to say, don't worry about Taylor series, start with this sequence as a primitive object,

582
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:39,340
and then something we talked about a couple lectures ago was, because of a nice property that this function has, which is basically that when you add the inputs,

583
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:52,140
basically this polynomial behaves like an exponential, and you can prove that just from the polynomial itself without calculus or anything, exp of a plus b equals exp of a times exp of b.

584
00:47:52,140 --> 00:48:05,380
And it's a very pleasing exercise to kind of work out the expansion and see that that works. And the fact that that works, we talked about this a couple lectures ago, implies that the whole sequence looks like whatever exp of one is raised to the x.

585
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:12,660
So what you could say is the number e is defined to be this particular sequence evaluated at x equals one.

586
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:21,420
And if you go that direction, that's all well and good, and it becomes a kind of substantive thing to talk about e to the x being its own derivative.

587
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:29,600
And it's one of the most pleasing exercises that you'll ever do, because we can take a look at this, and if you know how to take derivatives of polynomial terms,

588
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:36,460
well let's just work it out actually, I'll turn over a new leaf so that it can be nice and cleanly seen.

589
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,680
It's really one of the most pleasing, I don't know, times that you'll have in a calculus class.

590
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:48,720
If you're just sitting, you're looking at this particular infinite polynomial, and you're saying I wonder what the derivative of this happens to be.

591
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,740
And all you need to know is the power rule for polynomial terms, and you'll say that the derivative, let me take d dx,

592
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:03,400
well the derivative of a constant ends up being zero, the derivative of x is one,

593
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:13,540
the derivative of x squared over two, you know you might think of that two as kind of hopping down in front and leaving one less than itself,

594
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:24,720
so it becomes two times x to the one, just x to the one over two, and those twos cancel, so we're adding x.

595
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:31,080
x cubed over three factorial, I might write this out as x cubed over three times two times one.

596
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:40,180
This ends up being three times x squared, you know the exponent kind of hopped down and left behind one minus itself,

597
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:49,420
over three times two times one, the threes cancel, so we can see that that's actually the same as x squared over two factorial.

598
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:57,480
And in general, each one of our terms, as the exponent hops down, it cancels out one of the things from the factorials below it,

599
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,620
and what we get is the exact same sequence but shifted, which is quite nice.

600
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:11,700
And like I said, the traditional way that you see this series is that you're using the fact that e to the x is its own derivative,

601
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,960
in conjunction with Taylor series to show that it must equal this, but if you start with this as a primitive,

602
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,100
and you say this is the thing that defines a special function for which we use the shorthand, e to the x,

603
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:30,520
then it feels a little bit more contentful and quite fun to say that e to the x ends up being its own derivative.

604
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,460
And like we showed earlier, that then lets you take the derivative of all sorts of other things,

605
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:41,520
which in turn explains why we adopt the convention of writing all of our exponentials as e to something times t,

606
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:49,960
as opposed to writing them all as a to something times t, even though those are equivalent and often weirdly hard to appreciate.

607
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:56,420
So, with all of that said, we can turn ourselves back in the direction of natural logarithms,

608
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,900
because let's say I wanted to know the derivative of the natural log.

609
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:08,840
You might wonder why I want to know that, but if I have a deeper relationship with the natural log of x,

610
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,880
in terms not just of how it relates to these series, but in all facets of math, maybe we can then start drawing connections.

611
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:23,100
And if you build up that relationship by knowing things like its derivative, it actually helps you come back and understand things like the alternating series we were looking at before.

612
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:34,440
So, can we use the fact that e to the x is its own derivative to figure out the slope of a natural log curve?

613
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:44,660
Well, what that slope is asking us is to look at a given input x, we consider a tiny step dx to the right,

614
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,740
look at the corresponding step dy up, and we want to understand the ratio, dy over dx.

615
00:51:51,600 --> 00:52:00,860
Now, at this point, which has some kind of output y, what we can say is by definition, y is the natural log of x.

616
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,200
Now, this is the same statement as saying e, have I written this right? y is natural, yeah, great.

617
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,460
So, this is the same as saying e to the y is equal to x.

618
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:18,620
Now, from there, I can understand the relationship between tiny nudges to x and tiny nudges to y by taking derivatives.

619
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:28,080
If I ask about some tiny nudge to the value x and the corresponding tiny nudge to e to the y,

620
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:40,620
well, what it means for e to the x, or in this case, e to the y to be its own derivative, is that the size of that tiny nudge is e to whatever the y value at that point is, times dy.

621
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,500
And we're saying that that equals dx.

622
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:51,640
And what this lets us do then is express the slope that we want, dy over dx.

623
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,340
If we just rearrange things, it looks like 1 divided by e to the y.

624
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,700
So, what this is saying is that if we look at our graph, it's got some x coordinate, some y coordinate,

625
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,240
and I want to know what the slope is, this change to y over change in x.

626
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:16,320
I can't immediately express it in terms of x, maybe, but I do know whatever this value of y is, if I take e to the power of that and then reciprocate, that gives me the slope.

627
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:23,920
But of course, what it means to be on our graph is that y is the natural log of x, which is the same as saying e to the y equals x,

628
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,820
so this whole thing is the same as taking 1 divided by x.

629
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:35,660
So if I want to know that slope, I can say, what is your x coordinate, take 1 divided by that, and that gets me the slope of the natural log.

630
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,320
Which is, we've just gone through a process called implicit differentiation.

631
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:50,600
If you're not inclined to believe that this manipulation is legitimate, that we can just move around the dx's and dy's like that,

632
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,040
I have a whole video about implicit differentiation in the calculus series that you can take a look at.

633
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:03,200
But the point for us is that we have a very nice fact, that the derivative of ln of x looks like 1 divided by x.

634
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:11,300
And that's quite nice, and it kind of passes a gut check that ln of x gets shallower and shallower as you go on,

635
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,540
which means the slope gets smaller and smaller.

636
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,620
And the graph of 1 over x, you know, what does that look like?

637
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:25,480
Well, at the input, let's say we have the input 1 somewhere like here, it'll be at 1.

638
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,800
At the input 2, it'll be sitting at a half.

639
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,000
At the input 3, it'll be sitting at a third.

640
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,660
And in general, it gets lower and lower and closer to 0.

641
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:45,420
So the idea that this would describe the slope of that, you know, something that gets lower and lower closer to 0, seems to pass a little bit of a sanity check.

642
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:52,080
Now, the relevance that this is going to have to us will involve the inverse operation to differentiation.

643
00:54:52,080 --> 00:55:03,900
So instead of talking about what is the slope of the natural log curve, what I might do is ask about the area under this particular curve.

644
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:11,880
Let's say I take the area up to... my stomach was just rumbling, I don't know if that's audible on the microphone.

645
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,180
Clearly, gotta eat lunch before these things.

646
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,160
So let's say I want to understand the area up to n of something like this.

647
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:31,460
What that involves is taking the integral between 1 and our value n of 1 divided by x by dx.

648
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,260
Now this actually looks quite similar in spirit, the idea of adding up a bunch of things that look like 1 over x, to what we were looking at earlier.

649
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,180
How much earlier? I guess over here. Where we were adding up 1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth, on and on.

650
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:52,440
And already it gives a little bit of an intuitive instinct for why something like this sum would be related to natural logs.

651
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,340
Because we now know that in calculus land, natural logs are intimately related to the idea of 1 divided by x.

652
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:05,280
But I want you to think of this spelled out a little bit more exactly, and so we'll pop on over to our quiz one more time.

653
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,100
Second to last question for today.

654
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:18,680
And the question asks us, we're going to let s be the sum from n equals 1 up to capital N of 1 divided by n.

655
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:27,180
That's s. And then we're going to let i be an analogous integral, where we're integrating dx over x between 1 and n.

656
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,200
And it asks you to compare s and i.

657
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,040
I'll give you a moment to think about that.

658
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,760
Interestingly, we don't have a ton of consensus around this one.

659
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,840
So there's only three options, and we've got a nice split.

660
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,420
And as you guys know, this is actually one of my favorite things when we do any of these lockdown live quizzes,

661
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:21,640
is when it's not everyone hopping on to one particular thing, but we have a division among folks.

662
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:31,020
And I think that's great. I'm curious actually what the answer is going to be here.

663
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:37,340
And in fact, even if it's not been enough time to thoroughly think through, I'm going to go ahead and grade it,

664
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,960
just so that we can see what it happens to be.

665
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:47,340
And a lot of the spirit of it is that you kind of hazard a guess, so feel no shame if you entered an answer and it's not what turns out to be correct.

666
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,220
So in this case, the sum does in fact end up being bigger than the integral.

667
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,040
And it looks like 900 of you got that correct, which is awesome.

668
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,120
And then following that was people thinking that it was less.

669
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:08,800
And then to those in B thinking that they were identical, you know, that's a reasonable thought, because they're such similar expressions.

670
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:16,020
But there's a picture that really makes the answer kind of shine out to us here, which is, if I look at the curve 1 over x,

671
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:25,060
which is what this white curve is, it's 1 over x, and then I'm going to consider a bunch of bars, each of whose area corresponds to 1 over n for some value of n.

672
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:31,180
So for example, for the value 1, this bar has a width of 1, and then the height is 1,

673
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,840
and that means that right above the input 1 on its upper left corner, it's hitting the graph.

674
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:45,840
Now for the next term, if I want 1 over 2, that means it's going to hit the graph above the input 2, since the graph is defined to be 1 over x,

675
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:53,960
so its upper left corner hits that, and then the area of this bar whose height is 1 half is, well, 1 half, because its width is 1.

676
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,060
Similarly, this bar has an area of 1 third, this bar has an area of 1 fourth,

677
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:06,220
and so what you have is a sequence of rectangles whose total area is going to be similar to the area under the curve,

678
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,760
definitely similar, but you can tell that it's going to be bigger, because some of the area is leaking out.

679
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:18,060
In this context, we've got a lot of area leaking out from the first bar, a little bit less leaking out from the second, and on and on,

680
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:24,960
but as you go, because the graph flattens out, it becomes quite a good approximation once you account for the area that's leaked out there.

681
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:33,380
Now something kind of bizarre is happening here, where usually we think of these rectangles as being something like a Riemann sum that defines integration,

682
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:39,940
where we say, oh, we don't know what the area under a curve is, but we like areas of rectangles, so we use the rectangles to approximate the curve.

683
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,700
Here, we're going to do something that's backwards to that.

684
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:49,940
If we know calculus, we do know the area under the curve. It's very nice. It involves the antiderivative of 1 over x, like we'll show in a moment.

685
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:56,260
What we don't know is the sum of the areas of the rectangles. That was the sum that we were looking at earlier and trying to understand.

686
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:03,040
So here we're going backwards and using the area under a curve to approximate the area of a bunch of rectangles, which I think is fun.

687
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,420
It shows that calculus has this back and forth. It's not just geometry informing understanding of curves,

688
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,780
but it's an understanding of curves informing an understanding of geometry and number theory and things of that sort.

689
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:26,240
So what this means for us is that if we take a look back at our paper and we look at my much more sloppily drawn graph than the beautiful exact illustrations can give us,

690
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:37,240
if we want to understand that area, taking this integral, the task is to do an inverse derivative, to ask what function has a derivative that equals the inside here.

691
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:43,720
If that's something you haven't learned about, again, calculus series. Take a look at the fundamental theorem of calculus video,

692
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:50,560
or even the first video in that series I think shows a little of an instinct for why you have this relationship between slopes and areas.

693
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:59,540
But what it means for us is that we take the inverse derivative, which we now know is the natural log, the thing whose derivative is 1 over x is the natural log,

694
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,960
and we evaluate it at the bounds, at n and 1.

695
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:17,380
And this notation where I kind of put brackets around it and then a number in the upper right corner and lower right corner means I take that expression evaluated at the top minus that expression evaluated at the bottom.

696
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:28,600
And that, well, natural log of 1, what is that? e to the what equals 1? Well, it's 0.

697
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:39,040
Pretty much anything to the 0 will equal 1. So this term goes away entirely, and what we're left with is the natural log of n.

698
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:49,040
And what this means for us is if we were using our rectangles to approximate the sum, or using the integral to approximate those rectangles,

699
01:01:49,040 --> 01:02:01,560
it's saying that 1 over 1 plus 1 over 2 plus 1 over 3, on and on, up to a given bound is about equal to the natural log of n.

700
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:10,020
And more specifically, if you were to account for how much area is leaking out here, that area actually does converge.

701
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:24,380
As n tends towards infinity, the area that's leaked out approaches a certain constant, and it's called Euler's constant, or the Euler-Macheroni constant, and it happens to be around 0.577.

702
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:30,800
So in the same way that pi and e are constants of nature, this is another constant of nature, also bearing Euler's name.

703
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:42,040
And what it describes is the deviation between this sum, often called the harmonic sum, and the natural log of x, a thing that is related to e.

704
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,700
So Euler has really got his fingerprints all over the situation, at least as far as naming is concerned in our little expression here.

705
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:54,580
So that's quite nice. That's quite fun. But that only answers one of the mysteries that we had earlier.

706
01:02:54,580 --> 01:03:03,120
Because if you remember, I opened this whole thing up by talking not just about this series that grows like the natural log, we also alternated it.

707
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,540
We went 1 minus a half plus a third minus a fourth, and the claim is that that was the natural log of 2.

708
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,620
So let's see if we can try to understand why that's true.

709
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:24,040
And I might actually postpone explaining the even more bizarre fact that this interrelates with primes in a certain way, depending on how long I want this particular stream to go.

710
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:28,200
But at least finish off by understanding the alternating series, because it's extremely satisfying.

711
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,220
So to do that, let me just rewrite what our series looks like.

712
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:42,660
And this is one of those things where, as I go through the answer, it has a feeling of magic.

713
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:51,900
And sometimes not in a great way. You might find yourself looking at how we go about this and asking, how on earth would anyone ever come up with that?

714
01:03:52,780 --> 01:04:00,720
And maybe after we plop it all down, we can try to introspect and think about the reasonable ways that someone would come up with the following line of reasoning.

715
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:07,480
But it is not unique to this situation, it's kind of a useful set of tricks to be familiar with.

716
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,640
And there's a couple general principles in there.

717
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:19,040
The first general principle is that if we have a hard question, in this case figuring out what this sum approaches, bizarrely it can become easier if we make it more general.

718
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:27,040
You might think that making things more general would make it harder, because you have to answer a more powerful fact.

719
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:35,360
But math does this bizarre thing, where sometimes by trying to make it more general, you actually make the problem more tractable.

720
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:51,360
Which is quite cool, actually, because what it means is when a mathematician is motivated only by making their own life easier, it has the strange effect of making their results applicable to a wider variety of circumstances.

721
01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:01,820
So the way I'm going to generalize this, again, it might look kind of bizarre and unmotivated, but run with me for a second, is rather than thinking of a single value,

722
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:11,040
I'm going to put an x in here and consider this a function where I'm taking x over 1 minus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 3, on and on and on.

723
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:18,600
And I want to know, in general, what does this approach for various values of x, and then I just have to plug in the value x equals 1.

724
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:25,900
Now, like I said, that might make it seem harder, infinitely harder. Previously we just had to know one value, now you're asking me to compute infinitely many values?

725
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:34,580
But if you know calculus, you might recognize that the exponents of your polynomial terms might just play nicely with the denominators here.

726
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:41,100
And in particular, if we were to take the derivative of this series, it behaves quite nicely.

727
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:49,640
The derivative of x is 1, the derivative of x squared over 2, well that 2 hops down and cancels out the denominator, so it becomes negative x.

728
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,900
Similarly, that 3 hops down and cancels the denominator, so it becomes x squared.

729
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:06,960
And while you might not know why we're taking a derivative of something here, and how that would be helpful for actually evaluating the ultimate sum that we care about,

730
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:16,280
it is an interesting fact, and it's something that is playful and fun, that we've somehow simplified the expression by taking its derivative.

731
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:29,640
And the simplification is actually quite important, because there's a well-known fact within math that you can take a series where each term is the product of the last with a constant kind of product.

732
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:38,760
So here, as we go from one term to the next, we're always multiplying by negative x, so to go from negative x to x squared, you multiply by negative x,

733
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,180
and then similarly x squared to negative x cubed, you're multiplying by negative x.

734
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:52,060
And when that's the case, the series as a whole is going to approach 1 divided by, or wherever you start, but here we started at 1,

735
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:59,120
so the thing you started at divided by 1 minus the thing that you're constantly multiplying by, which is negative x.

736
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:09,060
So to give another example of where this comes up, is if we were to take something like 1 plus 1 half plus 1 fourth,

737
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:14,920
where each time in our sequence we are multiplying the last term by 1 half,

738
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:22,880
this will equal 1 divided by 1 minus the thing we were multiplying by, which was 1 half.

739
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:27,140
And 1 divided by 1 minus 1 half ends up being the same as 2.

740
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:33,640
And that actually kind of feels intuitive, that if we take 1 plus 1 half plus 1 fourth plus 1 eighth, you could even draw out a picture,

741
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:44,960
where let's say I've got a rectangle whose side length is 1, and 1 here, I can say the 1 represents this area,

742
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:51,540
and then half represents this area, and then a fourth represents this area, and an eighth represents that area,

743
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:55,840
and kind of keep playing this game, and eventually it'll fill an area of 2.

744
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:02,420
Now the more general version of that is this geometric sum, which someone who's done a lot of problem solving in math

745
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:09,380
is able to recognize kind of quickly, which is why they might enjoy this series much more than they would enjoy the one above it.

746
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:16,560
So this whole thing ends up looking like 1 divided by 1 plus x. Great.

747
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:22,840
But what this suggests is that if we somehow take an antiderivative, if we somehow integrate this,

748
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,320
we might have an alternate expression for what the initial sequence was.

749
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:39,380
So from here, I'm going to go ahead and pose a quiz, and part of this quiz is seeing who in the audience is comfortable with calculus,

750
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:43,060
and again if you're not, calculus series, go and check it out.

751
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:52,740
But what we have here is the question, what is the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x, dx?

752
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:59,120
I want you to evaluate that integral, and I'll give you a little moment for this one.

753
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,180
So, let's see.

754
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:46,560
And you know, tell you what, while answers are rolling in, before locking it in, I'm going to go ahead and just start describing the answer here.

755
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:56,920
So, if you want to know the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x, dx,

756
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,900
well we know that the antiderivative of 1 over x is the natural log of x,

757
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:09,420
so it's going to be the natural log of that inside divided by the derivative of the inside.

758
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,700
That's kind of the inverse chain rule, or something you can get with u-substitution.

759
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:17,440
But the derivative of the inside is just 1, so you can check yourself that if you take the derivative of this,

760
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:23,360
you get 1 over the inside, 1 over 1 plus x, but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1, so it stays the same.

761
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:33,180
So then we evaluate this at the bounds, 1 and 0, and what this ends up getting us is the natural log at the top,

762
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,880
which is 1 plus 1, minus the natural log of 1 plus x at the bottom, which was 1 plus 0.

763
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:46,980
The natural log of 1 plus 1 is of course ln of 2, and then we're subtracting off the natural log of 1, which is 0.

764
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,720
So, the proper answer here comes out to be the natural log of 2.

765
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,500
And it looks like 1600 of you have correctly answered that, so well done, well done indeed.

766
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:06,480
And if you wanted to kind of visualize this in your head or get some sort of gut instinct on which of those answers seemed loosely correct,

767
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:16,560
even if you didn't know how to calculate it immediately, the graph of 1 over 1 plus x is going to look just like the graph of 1 over x,

768
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:25,220
but shifted to the left, so it's actually going to pass through the input 0, 1, and then we're looking for the area under here.

769
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,260
So you know that it's going to be an area somewhere between 0 and 1, probably filling up more than a half of it,

770
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:36,780
and the natural log of 2 is around 0.69, so that actually seems about right.

771
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:46,440
But what's quite cool here is that if we say that the, well I can just write it out again here,

772
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:59,960
if I say I want to integrate this bottom expression from 0 up to 1, which is the same as integrating 1 over 1 plus x from 0 up to 1,

773
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,920
I know that that should be the value 2, ln of 2.

774
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:12,780
Okay? But on the other hand, if I picture taking my antiderivative and getting this whole sequence here,

775
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:21,840
and evaluating it between 0 and 1, what I'm doing is I'm plugging in the number 1, which gets me my alternating sequence,

776
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:25,660
then I'm subtracting off the value of 0, which when I plug it in just gets 0,

777
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:32,080
so evaluating this at 0 and 1 is the same thing as integrating the bottom expression from 0 to 1,

778
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,580
which is the same thing as integrating 1 over 1 plus x from 0 to 1, which is the same thing as ln of 2,

779
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,880
and hence that whole top thing ends up being ln of 2.

780
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:47,160
Very clever! Just such a sneaky sequence of manipulations that, like I said, if you just see it plopped down,

781
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:53,280
almost as intimidating because you wonder, how on earth do you go from seeing this sequence up here to thinking about,

782
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:59,580
ah yes, if I generalize it with lots of powers of x and then take the derivatives of those and then use a geometric series sum

783
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,740
and then integrate that using natural log, yes, then it'll all become obvious.

784
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,940
And I think the answer is that that's probably not what the problem solving process looks like.

785
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:12,040
Instead, you build up a familiarity with a lot of these things, like derivatives of polynomial terms,

786
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,720
and then you build up familiarity with other things, like derivatives of natural logs.

787
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,920
And the more familiarity you have with a lot of different pieces of math,

788
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:25,500
then sometimes when you see one particular pattern, you're able to draw in your mind a connection to things that make you look like a genius.

789
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:31,880
I think Euler did this all the time. If you look at some of the great discoveries of Euler, they just come really out of nowhere.

790
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:37,920
I mean the very opening thing that I talked about, I guess it wasn't the very opening, but early on,

791
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,500
where are we? I seem to have...

792
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:51,500
The sum of the reciprocals of squares, which, somewhere in my notebook here, we were just looking at the pages.

793
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,640
Maybe I tore it out. Oh, yeah, there we are.

794
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,960
Things can become a little bit of a mess over here.

795
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:05,640
But if we look at this long sum where we're taking 1 over 1 squared, 1 over 2 squared, and equals pi squared over 6,

796
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:15,880
the way that Euler found this, I mean, it involves this very strange thing where you start looking at an infinite product associated with sine of pi times x.

797
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:23,660
And if you think of it as starting with this sum and then dreaming up out of your head an infinite product associated with sine of pi times x,

798
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,480
or it might have been cotangent of pi times x or something like that, it really does seem like it came out of nowhere.

799
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:33,820
But in general, I think you build up these bits of familiarity with different pieces, and then once you see something,

800
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,940
like Euler seeing that Basel problem sum or someone seeing this alternating harmonic sum,

801
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:45,060
you're able to use those connections to kind of make yourself look smarter than you actually are, which is fun.

802
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,440
And thus, it helps motivate the idea of just being playful with your calculus and being playful with your math,

803
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:53,900
purely for the motivation of exposing yourself to more patterns and more
