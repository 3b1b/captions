00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,007
Let's go ahead and open things up today with a question that 

2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:06,360
might seem like it's incredibly unrelated to the title of the video.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,880
So if you guys go to 3b1b.co.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,080
Live, link is in the description.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,180
You've all been there for some of the warm-up animations.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,100
I want you to just make an estimate for the following question.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,280
It looks like a couple of you have already started coming in with answers here.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,200
Consider the numbers between 1 trillion and a trillion plus a thousand.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,180
Okay, so this range of a thousand integers that's pretty high.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,390
Which of the following would you guess is closest 

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,060
to the proportion of these numbers that are prime?

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,909
So if you were to go through the painstaking process of, you know, 

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,836
looking at all of those numbers between a trillion and a trillion plus a thousand, 

14
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:47,000
considering which of them are prime, what do you guess is the relevant proportion there?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,580
So don't worry about getting it right or wrong.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm mostly curious where people's intuitions are on this one.

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,838
So while we don't necessarily have to do those painstaking calculations, 

18
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:59,060
I have gone ahead and written up a simple program that can do that for us.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,086
So if we hop on over to Python, it's not exactly the most sophisticated 

20
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:07,280
program for getting primes in the world, but it'll get the job done for us.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,060
So if I type something like get primes between 0 and 50, you know, we take a look.

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,979
Okay, it's got 2, 3, 5, 7, all your favorite prime numbers between 0 and 50, 

23
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,340
you're gonna find in there.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,800
But maybe you don't like that range.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,860
Maybe you want to look between a thousand and a thousand fifty.

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,660
And there you go.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,120
There's the primes between a thousand and a thousand fifty.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,480
And there's fewer of them.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,641
In general, as you get bigger and bigger, the primes get sparser and sparser, 

30
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:35,540
essentially because each one has more options for what it could factor into.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,194
You know, if you're just doing the guess and check on something like 143, 

32
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:42,240
you just have to check all the numbers up to around its square root.

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,949
Whereas if you're checking around a trillion, you have to check on the order of, 

34
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:49,167
you know, something like a million numbers, all the primes up to a million, 

35
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,480
whether or not they go into it.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,233
So you might think that when we, let's say we define the list where 

37
00:01:55,233 --> 00:02:00,205
we're going to get all of the primes, you know, get the primes between a trillion, 

38
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,560
which is 10 to the 12th, and a trillion plus a thousand.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,340
This involves a lot of number crunching to actually find those primes.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,603
And you can see by the fact that, you know, the program I 

41
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:12,960
wrote isn't going to be the most efficient thing in the world.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,540
It takes a little bit of time before it gets there.

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,400
So we can look at that list in just a moment.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,520
But before I want to properly take a look at what everybody thinks.

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,940
And we have a great split!

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,640
Oh, I love questions that split up the audience like this.

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,420
That's always fun.

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,900
So what do you think?

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,540
What do you think is the actual density of primes up there?

50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,180
Ooh, the correct answer is only third place.

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,260
Usually in lockdown math, the correct answer is always at top.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,420
So this is exciting for me.

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,655
It seems like most, or the largest number of people thought that D, 

54
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:48,420
one out of 250, that there would only be four primes in that range.

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,947
After that, it was people who thought only one in a thousand, that up there, 

56
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,680
you know, primes are so rare they only come one in every thousand.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,860
The correct answer, the closest proportion here, would have been one in 25.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,940
So a lot more frequent than people might have thought.

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,933
And what's interesting is actually if you ask this question to a mathematician, 

60
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,202
they would be able to pretty quickly tell you what the correct answer is, 

61
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,500
not because they're doing all that number crunching.

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,684
And in fact, if you were to talk to a mathematician, they would look at this problem, 

63
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:18,139
they would do a small little calculation in their head and they'd say, 

64
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,789
the closest is one in 25, but really it's going to be closer to, you know, 

65
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:22,860
one in every 27 or 28.

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,040
That would be a bit more accurate.

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,160
You might wonder how they do that, because if we look at the number 

68
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,383
crunching that our computer had to do, it had to check all of the 

69
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:34,362
potential factors for all of the numbers we were looking at, 

70
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:38,660
and it does give us all of the primes between a trillion and a trillion plus a thousand.

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,452
So as you can see, they're, they're sparser than they 

72
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,820
are for just the numbers between zero and a thousand.

73
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,460
But there's a meaningful number of them.

74
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,920
You know, we've got one trillion seven hundred fifty one, one trillion seven eighty seven.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,680
The Boeing engineers are probably pleased that that's in there.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,560
And the actual length of that list is 37.

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
So there's 37 primes in there.

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,060
So the proportion out of the thousand is 0.37.

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,337
Or the way we were phrasing it, it was one out of something, 

80
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:09,420
so we might take the reciprocal of that and do a thousand divided by the number in there.

81
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
And it's about one in every twenty-seven.

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,550
But what the mathematician would do is they would say, 

83
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,439
I know this very cute fact about prime numbers, 

84
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,231
which is that the density of prime numbers near a given value, 

85
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,820
like a trillion, is around the natural log.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,300
So I'm going to type math dot log here, which takes a natural logarithm of that number.

87
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,180
And we can, you know, check if you want, what does the documentation tell us.

88
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,580
It says this returns the logarithm of X to a given base.

89
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,880
If the base is not specified, it returns the natural logarithm, which is log base e of X.

90
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,911
And just as a reminder, if anyone needs a little reminding on what logarithms mean, 

91
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,640
we talked about this all in the last lecture, so feel free to pop over.

92
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,974
But when you have an expression like L in X, which is telling us the log with 

93
00:04:55,974 --> 00:05:01,120
base e of X equals Y, that is saying the same thing as e to the power Y equals X.

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,000
It's asking the question e to the what equals X.

95
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,240
So for example, the natural log of 10, it's around 2.3.

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,217
And that's a kind of useful value to know if you want to make 

97
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:16,299
conversions between exponentials written with e versus exponentials written with 10, 

98
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,220
but the natural log of 10 is around 2.3.

99
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,120
So that's saying the same thing as e to the 2.3 equals 10.

100
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,119
Now the cutesy fact here is that prime numbers, 

101
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,000
their density is actually kind of related to this natural logarithm.

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,612
If we went over and we took the natural log of a trillion, 

103
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:36,922
which was the number defining our range at the lower end of that range, 

104
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,300
you'd see that it's 27.

105
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,800
And that was about the ratio we were looking at before, right?

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
A thousand divided by the length of our list of primes.

107
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,500
I mean, that's quite close.

108
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,713
And the fact that that happens at all is, I don't know, 

109
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:54,766
I might not call that my favorite piece of math because I use that term a lot, 

110
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:58,820
but it's definitely going to make the list of top five favorite pieces of math.

111
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,980
That the log with base e has anything to do with prime numbers.

112
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,665
So I want to show you another kind of cute fact associated with 

113
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:10,388
the relationship between natural logs and primes, 

114
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:14,800
because you might wonder why is it that we call this thing the natural logarithm?

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,880
There's lots of logarithms, lots of different bases.

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,440
What makes this one more natural?

117
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,650
And I think the more often you see it show up in nature, 

118
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,000
the more that name starts to kind of make sense.

119
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,340
So I'm going to play a game that will seem truly strange for a moment.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,295
I'm going to take an infinite series, for example one that's, 

121
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,720
you know, a favorite among a lot of people.

122
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,053
If you take 1 over 1 plus 1 over 4 plus 1 over 9 plus 1 over 16, 

123
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:44,860
and in general you're always taking 1 over n squared, and you add up all of those numbers.

124
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,835
If you keep adding and adding them, they'll stay below a 

125
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:51,020
certain bound and they'll actually approach a certain number.

126
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,022
And it was this open question in Europe, it was posed in Basel by I think 

127
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:58,620
one of the Bernoullis for a while, like what is the number that this equals?

128
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,335
And eventually Euler, genius of the day, was able to prove that it 

129
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:07,007
equals pi squared divided by 6, which is very beautiful, 

130
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:12,160
the idea that pi is at all related to just adding up the reciprocals of squares.

131
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,120
But it gets crazier than that.

132
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm going to play this weird game that's going to kick out terms 

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,846
that don't look like prime numbers, keep the prime numbers, 

134
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:26,160
and then also scale down ones that are sufficiently prime similar for us.

135
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,120
I'll show you what I mean.

136
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,520
So 1 is not at all a prime.

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,160
We're not even going to include it.

138
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,420
2 is a prime, so I'm going to keep that 1 over 2 squared term.

139
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,580
3 is a prime, so I'm going to keep the 1 over 3 squared term.

140
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,300
4, it's not a prime.

141
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,960
But I'm not going to kick it out because it is the power of a prime.

142
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,174
So I'm going to say that 1 over 4 squared term can stay, 

143
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:52,700
but because you're only the square of a prime, I'm going to scale you down by a half.

144
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,996
It's kind of a way of saying you look sort of like a prime, 

145
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:59,420
but because you're only a power of it, I'm scaling you down by that power.

146
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,300
5 is a prime, so we keep the fifth term.

147
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,420
6, not a prime, not a power of a prime.

148
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,400
We don't like it at all.

149
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,300
It gets kicked out.

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,731
7, we keep it, and you can sort of see where I'm going here, 

151
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:14,238
but I'll write a couple more examples because it's such a bizarre way to 

152
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:15,200
manipulate a series.

153
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,700
You would think that this isn't going to get us anything nice at all.

154
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,559
8, it's a power of a prime, but because it's a cube, 

155
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:24,200
I'm going to scale it down by a factor of 3.

156
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,440
So I'm going to take one third of the eighth term.

157
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,500
9, it's the square of a prime, so I'll take one half of the ninth term.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,880
10 gets kicked out, we ignore it entirely.

159
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,679
11 stays as is, and on and on.

160
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,600
So each one of your terms looks like the power of a prime.

161
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,473
1 over pk, and because this series, we're squaring them all, 

162
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:50,735
it's 1 over the power of that prime squared, but we scale it down by whatever 

163
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:51,500
that power is.

164
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,889
Now, because we've manipulated this in a pretty chaotic way, I mean, 

165
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,021
the primes are distributed in a pretty random fashion, 

166
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:03,040
you might think that this is completely uncomputable.

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,620
It's just a crazy situation.

168
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,258
And it's going to be smaller, you know, for sure it's going to be smaller than 

169
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,654
the pi squared over 6, because we left out the 1, we left out a lot of composite numbers, 

170
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,220
and prime powers bigger than, with a power bigger than 1, we scaled down.

171
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,580
So it's definitely a smaller number.

172
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,920
You might be able to guess where this is going based on the title of the video.

173
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,860
What it ends up equaling is the natural log of what it was before, of pi squared over 6.

174
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,760
And that's not just true for this particular sequence of sums of squares.

175
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,289
There's a number of other formulas that get us something related to prime, 

176
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:43,138
where we could, sorry, something related to pi, which is evidently related to primes, 

177
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:47,423
in a way that's, um, I mean, you play the same game and you have this weird 

178
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:51,540
fashion of taking logarithms, and not just any logarithm, the log base e.

179
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,157
So just to talk through what I mean in this other context, 

180
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:58,885
if you take 1 minus a third plus a fifth minus a seventh plus a ninth, 

181
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:03,400
and kind of alternate back and forth between the odd numbers, you get pi divided by 4.

182
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,220
I have a video all about this, Mathologer also has a video about it if you're curious.

183
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,020
Very beautiful why it's true.

184
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,540
But even stranger is when we play this game of keeping the primes and kicking out others.

185
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,140
So 1 we're going to kick out.

186
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,620
If we keep the third term, that's negative 3.

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,860
Then the 5, we keep that.

188
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,560
The 7, I guess it's a minus 1 seventh.

189
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,200
The 9, we keep it but we scale it down, because it's the square of a prime.

190
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,707
And in this case, because we're only looking at odd numbers, 

191
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:33,760
it looks like we're keeping quite a few of them.

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,480
We have to get bigger before we kick them out.

193
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,300
So like 15, that gets kicked out.

194
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,640
17 is positive, it gets to stay as is.

195
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,780
19 gets to stay as is.

196
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,460
21 gets kicked out.

197
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,040
23 gets to stay.

198
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,560
So a very bizarre thing.

199
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,080
I mean now the pluses and minuses, they don't alternate nicely.

200
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,080
It's like minus plus, minus plus, minus plus plus, minus minus.

201
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,380
It's a, it almost seems like a random sequence.

202
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,940
25, we can scale that down because it's 5 squared.

203
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,480
1 over 25.

204
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,387
And this doesn't equal pi fourths anymore, but 

205
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:09,820
it does equal the natural logarithm of pi fourths.

206
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,861
So evidently there's this relationship between taking logarithms with base e, 

207
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:19,386
which is to say, answering the question e to the what equals a value, 

208
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,520
and these sort of prime patterns.

209
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,551
And it's quite beautiful when you think about it, 

210
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,394
because if you look at like this entire sequence up here, 

211
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:31,120
it's going to equal some number such that e to that number is related to pi.

212
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,494
So you have this formula that's interrelating all of the prime numbers, 

213
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,259
and their powers for that matter, excluding the composite, 

214
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,400
so it's still a cool sequence, it's not just like all the integers.

215
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,420
We're taking e, raising e to the power of that sum, and you get something related to pi.

216
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,640
I mean, clearly better than Euler's formula.

217
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,720
I think you'd have to agree.

218
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,760
So, we might at the end of the lesson get to why that's true.

219
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,340
It'll depend on how much time there is.

220
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,880
But the next two facts I'll show you, we will definitely explain why they're true.

221
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,700
So we're going to play a couple more games with series here.

222
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,371
These ones are going to be a little bit simpler 

223
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,220
facts to think about than the first two that I showed.

224
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,832
But the relation with primes is just, oh man, if that doesn't make you love math, 

225
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,860
I don't know what would.

226
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,120
But if we played an alternating game that doesn't go through all the odd numbers, 

227
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,360
but it goes through every number.

228
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,680
So I'm going to take 1 minus a half plus a third minus a fourth, on and on.

229
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,780
And you might visualize this with a number line, where I'm going between 0 and 1 here.

230
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,280
When we take 1 minus a half, you're hopping backwards by a half.

231
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,940
And then plus a third, you're hopping forward by a smaller amount.

232
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,260
Minus a fourth, you hop backwards by a still smaller amount.

233
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,231
Then plus a fifth, and then backwards might get you here, 

234
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:43,440
and then forward might get you something like that.

235
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,526
And you're alternating back and forth, and because each one is smaller than the last, 

236
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:50,540
you can probably see that it has to zero in on some kind of value.

237
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,560
And as a matter of fact, it does.

238
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,850
It zeroes in on a value that's around 0.69 or so, 

239
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,320
and more precisely, it comes in on the natural log of 2.

240
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,760
The answer to the question, e to what is equal to 2.

241
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,220
Kind of strange, don't you think?

242
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,879
That something like e would show up with relation to 

243
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,140
just odd numbers oscillating back and forth like this.

244
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,592
And there's another relation that natural logarithms 

245
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,580
have to a sequence that looks like this.

246
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,164
You might ask, what happens if we don't alternate back and forth, 

247
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,660
but we add them all together?

248
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,360
What does that approach?

249
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,485
Because in the same way that, you know, when we added all the squares, 

250
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:35,357
the sum of the reciprocals of the squares, that approached a beautiful thing, 

251
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:39,478
it was pi squared over 6, you might think an even more natural question to ask is, 

252
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,720
don't square them at all.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,480
Take 1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth, on and on, what does this approach?

254
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,120
Now as it happens, it actually, it doesn't approach anything.

255
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,910
No matter how small a number you choose, this 

256
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,760
sequence is eventually going to get bigger than it.

257
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,640
So I could say, keep adding terms and eventually you'll get bigger than 100.

258
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,940
If you have some patience, keep adding terms and 

259
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,540
eventually you'll get bigger than a million.

260
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,129
And that's kind of surprising, because each one of these numbers is 

261
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,911
getting smaller and smaller, so as you're making your additions, 

262
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:12,420
you would think it's going to slow down, it won't get you past something like 100.

263
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,100
But I can explain to you why this is going to happen, it's actually a very pretty proof.

264
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,787
If I group my terms appropriately, so I'm going to group a third and a fourth together, 

265
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:26,572
I'm going to group all the numbers between a fifth and an eighth, 

266
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:29,554
all of the numbers between a ninth and a sixteenth, 

267
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:32,480
all of the numbers between 1 over 17 and 1 over 32.

268
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,064
So into these groups that grow in size by powers of 2, 

269
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:42,026
what I can say is that a third plus a fourth, well both of those numbers are 

270
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,380
bigger than a fourth.

271
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,551
A third is bigger than a fourth, and, well a fourth isn't bigger, 

272
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,207
but it's exactly equal to, but that does mean that their sum, 

273
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:55,806
yeah their sum is definitely going to be bigger than 1 fourth times 1 fourth, 

274
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:58,460
which is the same as taking 2 times a fourth.

275
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,682
Similarly, this sum here, 1 fifth plus 1 sixth plus 1 seventh plus 1 eighth, 

276
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:06,420
each one of those terms is bigger than an eighth.

277
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,440
All four of those terms are bigger than 1 eighth.

278
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,180
So the group of them together is bigger than 4 eighths.

279
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,882
Similarly over here, all of the numbers between a ninth and a sixteenth, 

280
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:23,369
all eight of those numbers are bigger than 1 and 16, 

281
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:27,120
so the sum all together is bigger than 8 times 1 over 16.

282
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,785
And you might see where I'm going with this, you know, 

283
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:37,783
here I have 16 numbers that are all bigger than 1 and 30, excuse me, bigger than 1 in 32, 

284
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:42,982
talking while writing, and of course all of these are just equal to one half, 

285
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:47,913
so this 2 fourths is the same as a half, 4 eighths is the same as a half, 

286
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,780
8 sixteenths, that's a half.

287
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,021
So in other words, what I can do is group all of my terms so that the sum 

288
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:01,940
instead looks like taking 1 plus a half plus a half plus a half on and on forever.

289
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,880
And that you can see, okay, if I keep going sufficiently long, it is going to get bigger.

290
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,198
And it also gives you a little instinct that this might actually be related 

291
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,480
to logarithms, because the size of our groupings grow according to powers of 2.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,669
So if you were wondering, how long do I have to go before the sum gets bigger than 10, 

293
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:25,232
you might have the instinct that, hmm, I'm going to have to add together, let's see, 

294
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:27,754
I have 1 and then the rest of them are halves, 

295
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:32,317
so I'm going to have to add together 18 different groups that each look like a half, 

296
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:37,040
so I might have to get up to the point where the size of my group is like 2 to the 17th 

297
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,080
or 2 to the 18th, something like that.

298
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,338
And you would be spot on that it grows, well, it doesn't grow exponentially, 

299
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:47,266
it grows logarithmically, because if you're asking how far do you need 

300
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:50,640
to go in order to get to that point, it would be logarithmic.

301
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,920
And as you might guess, it's actually the natural logarithm.

302
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,161
So if I add up all of the terms to about 1 over n, 

303
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:02,160
it ends up being approximately the natural log of n.

304
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,338
And if you want to get even more accurate, it's the natural log of 

305
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,934
n plus a certain constant, this is a constant we'll talk about later on in the lesson, 

306
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:14,578
but just for an order of approximation, this gives you the idea that 

307
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:17,220
you need to get up to around the natural log of n.

308
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,983
So I'm going to go ahead and pull up the quiz and ask you another question, 

309
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,119
just to see if you've been paying attention so far.

310
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,193
So our question asks, which of the following is closest to the 

311
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:33,982
smallest value of n for which the sum 1 plus a half plus a 

312
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:39,340
third plus a fourth on a 9 you keep adding until you get 1 over n.

313
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,420
How long do you have to go until that sum is bigger than a million?

314
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,235
So remember, your first instinct here might have been that this entire 

315
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:52,614
sum converges to something, in the same way that when you add the reciprocals of squares, 

316
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,340
it converges to pi squared divided by 6, very beautiful.

317
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,060
You might have thought that you keep going to this and it converges.

318
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,140
In fact, what happens is it'll always get larger, 

319
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,410
but you can be more quantitative than that, and you can ask, 

320
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,680
how long does it take before this gets larger than a million?

321
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,255
So I'll give you a little bit of time to think through what the answer to that will be, 

322
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:21,080
and I will say, because we're kind of converting between E-related things and base 

323
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,729
10-related things, if you wanted a little reminder, 

324
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:29,291
I can pull up the fact that the natural log of 10 is around 2.3, 

325
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,800
if you wanted to use that for estimation purposes.

326
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,847
So just to see if you were paying attention to the result that I just described 

327
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:42,960
of this thing growing like a natural logarithm, let's see how you answer.

328
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,340
And I'll give another 20 seconds or so here.

329
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,918
Alright, even if you're not necessarily finished, 

330
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:21,450
I'll go ahead and see where people are on this one, lock in the answers, 

331
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,240
and then explain where it comes from.

332
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,287
So, the correct answer is that it's around 10 to the 400,000 or so, 

333
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:30,440
which is a huge, huge number.

334
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,473
The estimated number of atoms in the universe is around 10 to the 80th, 

335
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,330
so it would be as if each atom in the universe had a universe inside of it, 

336
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,643
that would get us to 10 to the 160, then each one of those had a universe inside it, 

337
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,420
that only gets us to 10 to the 240.

338
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,127
You'd have to keep iterating like that over and over, and it would even, 

339
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:53,832
even that crazy idea, like mental thought for how you can get up to a big number, 

340
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:58,020
would take forever to get you to something of the size 10 to the 400,000.

341
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,542
Alright, now the way that you would think about 

342
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,760
something like this is to take a look at what I just said.

343
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,707
When we add up all these numbers up to the point 1 over n, 

344
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,220
it's about the natural log of n.

345
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,323
So what you're looking for is the value when the 

346
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:16,560
natural log of n is approximately a million.

347
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,000
That's how long you have to go before the sum gets bigger than a million.

348
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,860
This is the same statement as saying that n is about e to the power of a million.

349
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,765
Okay, but of all of our answers, we're expressed in terms of powers of 10, 

350
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:38,740
so in order to make the conversion, I would think to myself, 10 to the what is equal to e?

351
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,200
That way I'm going to be able to make a little substitution in here with the power of 10.

352
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,020
Well, this is asking me what is the log base 10 of e?

353
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,142
And from properties of logarithms, like what we learned last time, 

354
00:20:54,142 --> 00:21:00,160
this is the same as asking log base e of 10, but we're taking the reciprocal of that.

355
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:08,800
Okay, and another way you could think about that is that e to the 1 over x equals 10.

356
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,819
That these two expressions are the same, so we're looking for the natural log of 10, 

357
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:13,860
but we take 1 over it.

358
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,080
Now our estimation for the natural log of 10, if you happen to know, it's around 2.3.

359
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,374
All you would really need to know for this one is that it's roughly 2, 

360
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:27,810
or even that it's on the order of 1, because all the exponents in our options were 

361
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,040
looking very different.

362
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,420
So if you're asking what's 1 divided by 2.3, I mean very roughly, it's like a half.

363
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:41,150
So we could think of n as being very, very roughly something that's like 

364
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,960
10 to the 1 half to the 1 million, just to get us something kind of close.

365
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,542
So that looks like it's 10 to the 500,000, and we know that that 1 half really 

366
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:55,535
should be a little bit smaller, because we're taking 1 divided by 2.3, 

367
00:21:55,535 --> 00:22:00,260
not 1 divided by 2, so the number should be something a little smaller than 500,000.

368
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,563
And indeed, of all the options here, there's one that's much closer to 10 to the 

369
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:08,760
500,000 than anything else, so our very rough approximation would get us there.

370
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,140
Alright, so that's pretty fun.

371
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,569
Now, to start explaining where on earth some of these things are coming from, 

372
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:18,560
like why is the natural log present in these circumstances, 

373
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,001
I want to take a moment to start talking about E and the role that E 

374
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:26,140
plays in math in a way that I think sometimes it can be a little bit misunderstood.

375
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,953
So, just to start off, I'm going to pick a number from the audience, so in your own time, 

376
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:35,620
feel free to go to 3b1b.co and enter whatever your favorite number is.

377
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,140
But the thing I want to talk about to begin here is how...

378
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,780
Ooh, lots of answers coming in.

379
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,560
That's always fun.

380
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,620
When you see a family of functions, okay, so let's say we see something that looks like...

381
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,540
I'll pop on over here...

382
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,780
Something that looks like e to the r times x for various different values of r.

383
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,300
This is something you see all the time in engineering, in math, in physics.

384
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,046
We describe a bunch of different exponentials with some kind of parameter, 

385
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,000
like r sitting there.

386
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,330
And we say depending on what r is, this can give us a shallower exponential growth, 

387
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,448
something that grows exponentially but a little bit more slowly, 

388
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:13,080
versus a steep exponential growth.

389
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:14,540
Okay?

390
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,264
Once you're writing things in terms of a family, 

391
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:20,312
I think a lot of people have this instinct that these are all of the 

392
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:23,536
functions that e produces, like e the number is producing this beautiful 

393
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:24,420
family of functions.

394
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,650
But it's important to realize this is the same statement as creating a family of 

395
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,604
functions that just look like a to the x with various different bases, 

396
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:37,168
where it could tweak what that value of a is and say, you know, 

397
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:41,846
sometimes it looks like 2 to the power x, sometimes it looks like 3 to the power x, 

398
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:42,960
or 4 to the power x.

399
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,740
Tweaking that base gets us various different exponentials.

400
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,660
That's actually playing the same game.

401
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,530
For any one that you have here, like, you know, the function 3 to the x, 

402
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,280
taking powers of 3, I can choose an r such that e to the r x equals that.

403
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,440
And in fact, there's nothing special about e.

404
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,880
I could have chosen as the base here something like pi.

405
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,500
I could say look at the family of exponentials that look like pi to the r times x.

406
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,218
It's not that pi is producing these numbers or 

407
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:12,720
pi is related to this family in a particular way.

408
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,260
It's a choice that we're making to write it that way.

409
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,881
And almost always, the choice that we make in physics and engineering 

410
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:24,060
and math all over the place to write families of exponentials is with e.

411
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,053
So the right question to ask isn't what does e have to do with such a family, 

412
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,720
but why is it the right choice?

413
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,020
I'll give you another example of where this can come up.

414
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,300
I mean, they're all over the place, things that look like exponential curves.

415
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,620
But one that's very important for probability and statistics is the bell curve.

416
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,820
So it's something that we almost always write in the form e to the negative x squared.

417
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,699
And a way you might think about this, by the way, is if we take just e to the x, 

418
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:55,340
we get this thing that grows and it kind of decays as you go to the left.

419
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,040
And if we made it negative, it would decay as you go to the right.

420
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,200
So whenever the input to e to the x is getting very negative, it decays.

421
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,680
So to make it decay on both sides, you could take e to the negative x squared.

422
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,120
And then it's decaying on both sides and you get this nice bell curve.

423
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,305
And because of that square, it sort of smooths things out, 

424
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:18,570
whereas if we had taken something like the absolute value of x but negated it, 

425
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,080
okay, then it decays on both sides, but we get this awkward cusp.

426
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,740
That doesn't explain why this very specific curve comes up in statistics.

427
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,679
But if you ever kind of want to remember, oh, what was the formula for a bell curve 

428
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,740
again, you can kind of think through the fact that this should have roughly that shape.

429
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,560
And quite often it comes with some kind of parameters, though.

430
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,745
For example, I could put in something, maybe a value I'll call s in there, 

431
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:46,093
that will determine how wide and skinny this bell curve is, 

432
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:49,720
something like a standard deviation in the context of statistics.

433
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,120
S wouldn't be that standard deviation.

434
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,120
We would have to reciprocate it and square it and do some things.

435
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,260
But the idea that when you tweak what's in that exponent, it changes the bell curve.

436
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,160
That's the only point I want to make here.

437
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,242
You can think, just looking at this, that somehow 

438
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:05,360
bell curves are produced by the number e.

439
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,771
But that's not exactly true, because I could also write a to the negative x squared, 

440
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,860
and I get the same family of curves.

441
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,464
As I tweak the value of a, I'm also changing what that width is, 

442
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:20,579
so I could come up with other ways of describing the standard deviation of this 

443
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,300
in terms of a.

444
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,460
And it's the same family of curves.

445
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,580
It's not just that they look similar.

446
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,940
They are, in fact, the same thing.

447
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,420
And this is not too hard to show algebraically.

448
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,140
It almost makes it look a little bit more deceptively simple than it really is.

449
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,675
So we've got a lot of answers for what people wanted to enter 

450
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:40,040
as an example number to go with, so let's go ahead and see.

451
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,701
It seems like the most popular answer, by a little margin above i, is 69, 

452
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:49,202
which I assume is because if you take all of the natural numbers between 1 and 9, 

453
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:53,703
and then you look at the divisors for each one of those, you look at the numbers, 

454
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:57,820
you list all their divisors, and you add up the divisors, it adds up to 69.

455
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,855
And adding up divisors like this is a very fun and common thing in number theory, 

456
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:03,660
so I assume that's why people chose it.

457
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,040
But the point here is that if you see some kind of function like, 

458
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,120
let's see, how should I write it?

459
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
69 to the power x.

460
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
I could also write that.

461
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,380
I could write the same thing as e to the power of the natural log of 69.

462
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,720
Okay, I've written that kind of sloppily.

463
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,420
Let me do it again.

464
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,960
e to the natural log of 69.

465
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,520
That's the same thing as the number 69, right?

466
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,374
Because it's saying e to the what equals 69, but then I've taken e to that, 

467
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:36,560
so I should get 69 back.

468
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,800
All of that to the power x.

469
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,972
And by the rules of exponentials, this is the same thing as e to just some constant, 

470
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:47,620
whatever the natural log of 69 is, times x.

471
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,471
So I could replace that with a constant, which happens to be around 4.234, 

472
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:57,204
as any mathematician will be able to tell you, well-known constant of nature, 

473
00:27:57,204 --> 00:27:58,540
the natural log of 69.

474
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,060
And the point here is that this just looks like e to some constant times x.

475
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,020
So you might wonder, why do we make this choice, right?

476
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,460
Because it didn't have to be pi.

477
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,760
I could write that same function, sorry, it didn't have to be e.

478
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,740
I could write that same function as pi raised to a special power, namely the log base pi.

479
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,120
Man, I'm writing quite sloppily here.

480
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,380
Log base pi of 69 times x, that would be the same function.

481
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,340
We could describe everything with a base of pi if we wanted to.

482
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,342
And to just give one more example of where I think this, even though it's a, 

483
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,457
like it's a simple conversion if you know logarithms, 

484
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:44,534
that anything that looks like a to the x can be expressed as e to something times that, 

485
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:48,976
I think it's clearly not very appreciated that you can make that conversion, 

486
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:52,438
because any time that we talk about imaginary exponentials, 

487
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:56,823
and I get that it's kind of a weird thing to talk about e to the i times t, 

488
00:28:56,823 --> 00:29:01,957
once someone learns, you know, and I've made a number of videos in this series about it, 

489
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:05,419
Mathologer has videos, lots of people have videos about it, 

490
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,092
the idea is that e to the imaginary constant times some value t walks you around 

491
00:29:10,092 --> 00:29:13,900
the unit circle, and in fact it walks you a distance of t radians.

492
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,351
And the importance of this, the way that it comes up in, for example, 

493
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:23,760
electrical engineering, is it gives you this oscillating pattern.

494
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,732
As you scale up t, you have something that's oscillating, 

495
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:30,296
and it gives a very nice way to describe sine waves and cosine waves and 

496
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,420
signals that oscillate.

497
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,947
And there's actually one electrical engineer that I used to know, 

498
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,280
and he would always say, oh I love the number e.

499
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,700
What I like about e is it's the number that spins.

500
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,940
That's really what makes e special, I realized this.

501
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,180
e is the number that spins.

502
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,840
But the problem is that's not, that's not exactly true.

503
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,220
It is true that e to the i t spins around, but that's not special to e.

504
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,643
I could also take 2 to the i times t, and that 

505
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,860
will also produce values that walk around a circle.

506
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,384
And we can think through more exactly, 2 is the same thing as e to the natural log of 2, 

507
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:09,896
so 2 to the i t is the same as e to the natural log of 2 times t, 

508
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:12,700
all of that times the imaginary number i.

509
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,820
Which basically means it's doing the same thing as e to the i t, it's just rescaling time.

510
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,380
It's walking a little bit more slowly.

511
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,487
And then similarly, if you were to take something like your 

512
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:28,935
favorite number to the i times t, that would look like e to 

513
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:33,680
the approximately 4.234 times t, all times the imaginary number.

514
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,280
Which just means you're walking around at a different rate.

515
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
So e is not the number that spins.

516
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,360
The idea of complex exponents walking around a circle doesn't have to do with e per se, 

517
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,280
it really just has to do with a lot of what we talked about I think in lectures 4 and 5.

518
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,280
And I'll go over it again in just a moment here as a quick reminder.

519
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,598
So the thing that's special about e, the reason that we always 

520
00:30:56,598 --> 00:31:00,340
choose to write things in this way, has to do with rates of change.

521
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:10,640
That when you take the derivative of e to the power t, this is the same thing as itself.

522
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,808
Which is to say if we were to graph this, you know maybe e to the t 

523
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,820
represents an amount of money you have over time or something like that.

524
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,685
And we were to look above a value of t, the slope of this graph, 

525
00:31:25,685 --> 00:31:29,580
the rate at which it's increasing, is actually equal to its own height.

526
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,821
So the farther you are along the curve, meaning you have a greater height, 

527
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:34,840
the steeper it is.

528
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,480
So the more money you have, the faster it grows.

529
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,740
This is the power of compound growth.

530
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,100
But that's actually true of any exponential.

531
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,486
What makes e special is that they're exactly the same, 

532
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,960
it's not just that they grow in proportion with each other.

533
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,385
So if we were to write a family of exponential curves as e to the r times t, 

534
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:57,756
as opposed to writing it as a to the power t, and thinking of changing that value a, 

535
00:31:57,756 --> 00:32:02,368
the value in doing that is that taking the derivative by the chain rule, 

536
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:06,033
we take the derivative of the inside, which looks like r, 

537
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:10,520
and we multiply by the derivative of the outside, which is e to the rt.

538
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,807
And if anybody here doesn't know calculus by the way, 

539
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,946
we're about to start doing a fair amount of it, 

540
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:19,067
I have a whole series on it that you can pop over and take a look at, 

541
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,920
lots of other places on YouTube and such to give a quick primer.

542
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,794
But if you're coming in and you're not familiar with calculus, 

543
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:27,760
like just be warned that that's where we're about to start going.

544
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,717
Because if you want to understand natural logarithms, 

545
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:34,037
and by extension the number e, the importance that they have has 

546
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:38,480
everything to do with rates of change and the inverse of that operation, as you'll see.

547
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,600
So anyway, why would it be nice to express a function like this?

548
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,200
Well what it's telling you, let's say this was something like the size of your investment.

549
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,680
This is an expression saying how much money you have at a given point in time.

550
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,332
If you want to know the rate of change of that, how much is it changing per unit time, 

551
00:32:56,332 --> 00:33:00,240
it's proportional to itself, and r gives you that proportionality constant.

552
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,170
If r was 0.01, it's telling you that the rate 

553
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,080
of growth is 10% of the size of the thing itself.

554
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,913
So the choice that we make to write things this way is, 

555
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:13,880
it's basically a way to make all the constants involved more readable.

556
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,435
So if you're to look at these statistics associated with bell curves, 

557
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:21,755
and the way that we actually tend to write things, 

558
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:26,115
the pattern ends up looking something like 1 divided by s squared, 

559
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:29,240
and sometimes that x instead of writing it as x.

560
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,060
Strange parentheses.

561
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,080
I might say x minus m for some value of m.

562
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,495
Both of these terms end up having really nice readable meanings, where m, 

563
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:44,516
this isn't specific to the e fact, but it's just a common thing you'll see, 

564
00:33:44,516 --> 00:33:47,796
m gives you the mean of the distribution, where this pile is, 

565
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,860
and s gives you the standard deviation.

566
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,357
And when we choose to write this family with e, 

567
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:55,980
it's giving those constants readable meanings.

568
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,820
And a similar thing happens with how we describe complex exponentials.

569
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,763
When we choose to write the idea of walking around a circle with e, 

570
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:07,780
it gives a very readable meaning to what this term t is.

571
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,500
It's saying, what is the distance that you've walked along the unit circle?

572
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,647
And you can actually understand this with derivatives pretty well, where if we say, 

573
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:23,163
what is the derivative, what is the rate of change of some value that looks like e to 

574
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:28,101
the i times t, by the chain rule, this is going to look like i times itself, 

575
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:29,320
e to the i times t.

576
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,120
Now what would that actually mean?

577
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,690
That means that if you're sitting at some kind of number, 

578
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,630
if this is your current value for e to the i times t, 

579
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,277
the rate of change is i multiplied by that value, 

580
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:46,560
which is a 90 degree rotation of this vector.

581
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,679
Maybe I would draw it like this.

582
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,080
This right here would give you your rate of change.

583
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,440
So you might move that over and consider it a velocity vector.

584
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,642
So this is kind of like your velocity vector, this is kind of like your position vector, 

585
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,360
which I might write something like an s.

586
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,263
So what this whole expression of e to the i times t is essentially saying is, 

587
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:11,660
whatever this does, if it's somewhere in the complex plane, at every given point, 

588
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,200
the rate of change of my vector is a 90 degree rotation of itself.

589
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,612
And so that's why we're walking around the circle at a speed of one unit per second, 

590
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:23,361
because the length of the position vector is one, 

591
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,780
so the length of the velocity vector is one.

592
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,725
And it's also why, if you were to look at two to the i t, 

593
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:30,380
it walks around at a different rate.

594
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,781
Because there, the constant is not just i, a 90 degree rotation, 

595
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:38,440
it's i times natural log of two.

596
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,536
i times something would mean that this, where are we, 

597
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:46,272
this operation here is not just a 90 degree rotation, 

598
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:49,040
it's a 90 degree rotation and a scaling.

599
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,504
So your velocity vector would end up looking a little bit shorter, 

600
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:55,100
and you'd be walking around the unit circle more slowly.

601
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,660
So that's kind of the important thing to understand about e, 

602
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,909
the fact that it's a choice that we're making to write families of exponentials this way, 

603
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:06,733
but because it is its own derivative, that ends up making these things play much 

604
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:07,300
more nicely.

605
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,780
Now, this lets us take derivatives of anything else if you wanted.

606
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:18,156
If you did describe your money's rate of growth with a to the t, to take its derivative, 

607
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:23,947
you could first do a conversion, write the whole thing as e to the natural log of a 

608
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:29,945
times t, and the reason you would is then when we're, I sort of squished my font here, 

609
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:33,255
then when you're taking the derivative of that, 

610
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:36,978
the derivative of the inside is the natural log of a, 

611
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:42,011
and then that's multiplied by itself, e to the natural log of a times t, 

612
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:47,320
which you could then spell out even further, convert it back into a to the t.

613
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,598
So if you did describe all of your investments as a to the power t, 

614
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:55,116
which kind of feels more natural to a lot of people, that oh, 

615
00:36:55,116 --> 00:37:00,223
you might say rather than e to some investment rate times t, just think of 1.05 to the t, 

616
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:02,720
and that describes something like 5% growth.

617
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,925
If you were thinking of that growth in a continuous sense, 

618
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,182
not year over year, what's the new percentage, but moment by moment, 

619
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:12,392
what's the rate of growth, you would have to say the rate of growth 

620
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:15,980
is the natural log of that base, which just feels a little bit more awkward.

621
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,620
You could do it, but it would feel more awkward.

622
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,300
Now, all of this leaves open the question of why?

623
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:28,780
Why on earth is the derivative of e to the t equal to itself?

624
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,840
It's this very nice property, so you might wonder where this thing comes from.

625
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,160
And it really has everything to do with how you define the number e.

626
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,508
And this can be a little bit frustrating, where in some contexts you'll see people say, 

627
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:44,460
what is the number e?

628
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,160
Well, it's the number defined such that this derivative equals itself.

629
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,380
And then other contexts, you might find e defined in a different 

630
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,600
way that is very conducive to whatever the circumstance there is.

631
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,605
So you might wonder, okay, can we come at this a little bit more directly, 

632
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:04,614
and try to understand derivatives of exponentials, 

633
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:07,800
and see why the special value 2.718 would fit into it.

634
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,160
And to do that, let me draw myself a new graph here.

635
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,560
Let's say I have some kind of exponential.

636
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:25,796
And if I want to understand the rate of change, the slope tangent to that point x, 

637
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:30,606
the way we often think about it is think of two nearby points, 

638
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:35,340
so another one that might be x plus a little constant times h.

639
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,306
And then we're going to look at the slope between those 

640
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:41,800
two points and consider what happens as h goes towards zero.

641
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,743
So if this whole graph was a function a to the x, 

642
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:49,276
if we wanted to give a very direct look at what might the derivative of this 

643
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:53,514
expression be, we can make an attempt to calculate it ourselves without 

644
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:58,283
depending on a pre-established fact handed down from on high that e to the t is, 

645
00:38:58,283 --> 00:39:01,697
or I guess in this case e to the x is its own derivative, 

646
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:04,700
and then manipulate based on natural logs and such.

647
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
So what does this look like if you try to come at it directly?

648
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,416
Well what you would say is that the change in the height of the graph divided 

649
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:17,865
by the change in the width, the sort of rise over run, dy dx, 

650
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:22,314
looks like the difference in the outputs at those two values, 

651
00:39:22,314 --> 00:39:28,485
so the output at the high value, which is x plus h, minus the value at the low value, 

652
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:34,800
a to the x, all of that divided by the step in the x direction, which is just of size h.

653
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,078
And the fact that we are doing calculus here, that we have the little d's, 

654
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:45,390
that is a signal to us that we don't just want this ratio for a particular value of h, 

655
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,382
we want to consider what that ratio change in y, 

656
00:39:48,382 --> 00:39:51,740
change in x looks like as the change in x goes to zero.

657
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,221
And here I'm writing that change in x as h, so 

658
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,500
it's a limit as h goes to zero of this expression.

659
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,580
And from here you can try to manipulate it a little bit and see what you might find.

660
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,212
The first step, take advantage of the exponential 

661
00:40:05,212 --> 00:40:09,280
properties to write this as a to the x times a to the h.

662
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,299
And what's nice about that is it lets us factor out an a to the x, 

663
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:18,279
because it shows up both in the first term and the second, 

664
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:23,338
so I could write this whole thing as a limit of a to the x outside of a to 

665
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,160
the h minus one all over h.

666
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,620
And this was the limit as h goes to zero.

667
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,458
Well, x has nothing to do with the h here, so 

668
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:34,660
we're allowed to pull out the a to the x term itself.

669
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,233
As far as h is concerned, it's just some constant rescaling the thing, 

670
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:42,440
and the limit of a constant times a thing is that constant times the limit of the thing.

671
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:53,120
A times, or a to the x times the limit as h goes to zero of a to the h minus one over h.

672
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,560
And at this point, we're a little bit stuck.

673
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,952
We've found a very interesting fact, which is that any kind of exponential, 

674
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:06,848
e or whatever you want, base pi to the x, two to the x, 69 to the x, 

675
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:10,237
those have derivatives that are proportional to themselves, 

676
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:13,400
but we want to understand this proportionality constant.

677
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,143
And I could ask you to guess, just to see if you can get 

678
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:20,060
a feel for it in the context of one particular example.

679
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,244
So let's say that I'm choosing a base of something like two, 

680
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:26,220
and I want to understand rates of change of two to the x.

681
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,916
Our question asks us, the limit below, I guess it tells us, 

682
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,860
it tells us a little bit about what it is.

683
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,980
The limit below is a number between zero and one.

684
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,517
So this is, we're looking at two to a small value 

685
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:40,940
minus one divided by that same small value.

686
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,660
Don't worry about calculating it exactly, I'm just kind of curious if you guessed.

687
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,304
Enter some kind of guess for what this value is, 

688
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:52,460
and then round it to two decimal places so that we can have some consistency.

689
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,898
So we'll give you a moment to just think of what it might be, 

690
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:57,900
but don't think too hard if you don't want to.

691
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,420
It's totally okay to get this one wrong, we just want to see what people think.

692
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,437
Looks like we've got a couple things coming in from the audience here, 

693
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:38,620
which is always fun.

694
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,054
So Robert points out that in French the notation reads, 

695
00:42:42,054 --> 00:42:45,980
logarithm l'imperillain, and is wondering why this word is used.

696
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:51,437
I asked this on Twitter the other day, evidently it's in reference to a person, 

697
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:55,000
I think John Napier, and so it's in reference to him.

698
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,042
And then there was a truly terrible French pun about an exponential 

699
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:04,460
and a logarithm walk into a bar and they order a beer and who pays?

700
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,033
And the answer is that the exponential has to pay because la logarithm n'imperillain, 

701
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:13,546
which anyone who speaks French will like groan and laugh at, 

702
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:15,620
but that made me laugh a little bit.

703
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,480
Do I have a personal vendetta against e?

704
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,680
Yeah, yeah I do, I think it's an overrated constant.

705
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,834
I think it's beautiful, but I think it's beautiful 

706
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,580
in ways that aren't what people think they are.

707
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,742
And I also think that, I'm going to talk about this in a moment, we should write, 

708
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,060
we shouldn't write the exponential function as e to the x, 

709
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,440
because when it's more general that doesn't make sense and I think it confuses people.

710
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,992
We should just write it as what it is, which is a certain polynomial, 

711
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,478
and just be honest up front rather than letting e, 

712
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:43,940
like e has nothing to do with e to the pi i, that's a frustrating fact.

713
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,240
It shouldn't be in there.

714
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:48,887
Anyway, German here is normal for how you do maths 

715
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,340
on a ruled paper instead of graph paper.

716
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,543
I mean graph paper is definitely nicer, but I don't know, 

717
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:57,740
this was the paper that I just had on hand.

718
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,573
And in general if you want to make any comments or questions about the lesson, 

719
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,484
you can do so on Twitter with the hashtag locked down math, 

720
00:44:04,484 --> 00:44:06,280
and those will be pulled up as we go.

721
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,181
So it seems like we have strong consensus on our guess here, 

722
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:15,406
which is people guessing that the correct answer to this limit is that it's around 0.69, 

723
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:20,396
which I assume the reason everybody guessed that is because it's the correct answer, 

724
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:23,390
that this limit does in fact approach around 0.69, 

725
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,500
and we could play with Python if we wanted to see that experimentally.

726
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,738
Python's kind of overkill here, you could do it with any calculator, 

727
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:35,373
but if I raise 2 to some small power, I get some kind of number, 

728
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,617
and if I subtract 1 from that, then I get a small number, 

729
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:43,202
and if I divide it by the same small power, so here I have three zeros and a one, 

730
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:45,160
it looks like we get around 0.6931.

731
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,554
And if I made it a smaller value that I was doing, 

732
00:44:48,554 --> 00:44:52,880
it seems to stay pretty stable around there, it's around 0.69314.

733
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,480
So congratulations to the majority of you who had the right guess here.

734
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,335
And in fact it's no coincidence that that's what it is, because like I said earlier, 

735
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:06,820
if you're taking the derivative, where have I written it?

736
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,900
I've written it somewhere.

737
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,866
Sloppily as I want to do, I've written that if you take the derivative of something 

738
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:16,660
that looks like a to the t, the constant sitting in front is the natural log of a.

739
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,352
So for something like 2, you would be looking at the natural log of 2, 

740
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,440
which is in fact around 0.69.

741
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,760
Now, all of that was dependent on the fact that e to the x is its own derivative, right?

742
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,945
So there's one avenue that you could take here, 

743
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:35,500
if you want to come up with a definition of e.

744
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,525
What you could say, and this is totally valid, 

745
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:43,160
is the number e is defined to be the constant such that this limit is 1.

746
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,760
If that's the case, then e to the x is its own derivative, by definition, pretty much.

747
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,347
And then from there, you will get the fact that anything else, 

748
00:45:53,347 --> 00:45:58,000
its derivative can be expressed in terms of the log base e of itself.

749
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,360
That's one way that you could go.

750
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,838
Another avenue that you could take is to say that when we write e to the x, 

751
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:08,080
this is actually shorthand for a certain polynomial.

752
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,242
I'm partial to this because I think this is an honest representation of the role 

753
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:17,380
that it plays more generally, like when we start talking about complex numbers.

754
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,132
It's weird to me that in high school I saw Euler's formula as the polar representation 

755
00:46:23,132 --> 00:46:27,761
for complex numbers before it was ever really explained that e to the x does not 

756
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:32,620
refer to the repeated multiplication, that it's a shorthand for this long polynomial.

757
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,380
You might give it another name, like exp, right?

758
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,900
And then that's something that it makes sense to plug in complex numbers to.

759
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,429
Traditionally, the way that you see this series in high school is you might go 

760
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:51,756
through a calculus class where you learn about e to the x being its own derivative, 

761
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:55,180
and then maybe at the end of a second calculus class, 

762
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,444
the fact that it is its own derivative, in conjunction with a very wonderful topic 

763
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,220
called Taylor series, right?

764
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,056
So it being its own derivative and Taylor series proves that e to the 

765
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:11,840
x must equal this long polynomial, which is absolutely the case, right?

766
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,048
If you have a function that is its own derivative and at the value zero it equals one, 

767
00:47:17,048 --> 00:47:20,020
you will find that it has to equal this polynomial.

768
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,692
An alternate approach that you could take if you wanted in setting the foundations is 

769
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:31,066
to say, don't worry about Taylor series, start with this sequence as a primitive object, 

770
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:34,810
and then something we talked about a couple lectures ago was, 

771
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,889
because of a nice property that this function has, 

772
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,848
which is basically that when you add the inputs, 

773
00:47:40,848 --> 00:47:44,169
basically this polynomial behaves like an exponential, 

774
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:49,302
and you can prove that just from the polynomial itself without calculus or anything, 

775
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:52,140
exp of a plus b equals exp of a times exp of b.

776
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,368
And it's a very pleasing exercise to kind of work 

777
00:47:54,368 --> 00:47:56,240
out the expansion and see that that works.

778
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,827
And the fact that that works, we talked about this a couple lectures ago, 

779
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:05,380
implies that the whole sequence looks like whatever exp of one is raised to the x.

780
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,165
So what you could say is the number e is defined to 

781
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:12,660
be this particular sequence evaluated at x equals one.

782
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,501
And if you go that direction, that's all well and good, 

783
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:20,415
and it becomes a kind of substantive thing to talk about e to the x being 

784
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:21,420
its own derivative.

785
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,095
And it's one of the most pleasing exercises that you'll ever do, 

786
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:30,183
because we can take a look at this, and if you know how to take derivatives of polynomial 

787
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:35,216
terms, well let's just work it out actually, I'll turn over a new leaf so that it can be 

788
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:36,460
nice and cleanly seen.

789
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,570
It's really one of the most pleasing, I don't know, 

790
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,680
times that you'll have in a calculus class.

791
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,465
If you're just sitting, you're looking at this particular infinite polynomial, 

792
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:48,720
and you're saying I wonder what the derivative of this happens to be.

793
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,920
And all you need to know is the power rule for polynomial terms, 

794
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,240
and you'll say that the derivative, let me take d dx, 

795
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,799
well the derivative of a constant ends up being zero, the derivative of x is one, 

796
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:11,680
the derivative of x squared over two, you know you might think of that two as kind of 

797
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,160
hopping down in front and leaving one less than itself, 

798
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,279
so it becomes two times x to the one, just x to the one over two, and those twos cancel, 

799
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:24,720
so we're adding x.

800
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,416
x cubed over three factorial, I might write this 

801
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:31,080
out as x cubed over three times two times one.

802
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:37,413
This ends up being three times x squared, you know the exponent kind of hopped 

803
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:43,923
down and left behind one minus itself, over three times two times one, the threes cancel, 

804
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:49,420
so we can see that that's actually the same as x squared over two factorial.

805
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,015
And in general, each one of our terms, as the exponent hops down, 

806
00:49:55,015 --> 00:49:59,821
it cancels out one of the things from the factorials below it, 

807
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:05,620
and what we get is the exact same sequence but shifted, which is quite nice.

808
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:09,788
And like I said, the traditional way that you see this series is that you're 

809
00:50:09,788 --> 00:50:12,711
using the fact that e to the x is its own derivative, 

810
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:16,337
in conjunction with Taylor series to show that it must equal this, 

811
00:50:16,337 --> 00:50:20,560
but if you start with this as a primitive, and you say this is the thing that 

812
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,403
defines a special function for which we use the shorthand, e to the x, 

813
00:50:24,403 --> 00:50:28,408
then it feels a little bit more contentful and quite fun to say that e to 

814
00:50:28,408 --> 00:50:30,520
the x ends up being its own derivative.

815
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,293
And like we showed earlier, that then lets you take the derivative of all sorts of 

816
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:40,067
other things, which in turn explains why we adopt the convention of writing all of 

817
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:44,841
our exponentials as e to something times t, as opposed to writing them all as a to 

818
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:49,960
something times t, even though those are equivalent and often weirdly hard to appreciate.

819
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,970
So, with all of that said, we can turn ourselves back in the direction of natural 

820
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,900
logarithms, because let's say I wanted to know the derivative of the natural log.

821
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,191
You might wonder why I want to know that, but if I have a deeper relationship 

822
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:11,264
with the natural log of x, in terms not just of how it relates to these series, 

823
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:14,880
but in all facets of math, maybe we can then start drawing connections.

824
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,488
And if you build up that relationship by knowing things like its derivative, 

825
00:51:18,488 --> 00:51:21,007
it actually helps you come back and understand things like 

826
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:23,100
the alternating series we were looking at before.

827
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:28,405
So, can we use the fact that e to the x is its own 

828
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:34,440
derivative to figure out the slope of a natural log curve?

829
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,014
Well, what that slope is asking us is to look at a given input x, 

830
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:47,064
we consider a tiny step dx to the right, look at the corresponding step dy up, 

831
00:51:47,064 --> 00:51:50,740
and we want to understand the ratio, dy over dx.

832
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,943
Now, at this point, which has some kind of output y, 

833
00:51:55,943 --> 00:52:00,860
what we can say is by definition, y is the natural log of x.

834
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,120
Now, this is the same statement as saying e, have I written this right?

835
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,200
y is natural, yeah, great.

836
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,460
So, this is the same as saying e to the y is equal to x.

837
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,544
Now, from there, I can understand the relationship between 

838
00:52:15,544 --> 00:52:18,620
tiny nudges to x and tiny nudges to y by taking derivatives.

839
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:24,040
If I ask about some tiny nudge to the value x and the corresponding 

840
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,982
tiny nudge to e to the y, well, what it means for e to the x, 

841
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:33,286
or in this case, e to the y to be its own derivative, 

842
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:39,902
is that the size of that tiny nudge is e to whatever the y value at that point is, 

843
00:52:39,902 --> 00:52:40,620
times dy.

844
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,500
And we're saying that that equals dx.

845
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:51,640
And what this lets us do then is express the slope that we want, dy over dx.

846
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,340
If we just rearrange things, it looks like 1 divided by e to the y.

847
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,359
So, what this is saying is that if we look at our graph, it's got some x coordinate, 

848
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,416
some y coordinate, and I want to know what the slope is, 

849
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:06,240
this change to y over change in x.

850
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,292
I can't immediately express it in terms of x, maybe, 

851
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:14,188
but I do know whatever this value of y is, if I take e to the power of that and then 

852
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:16,320
reciprocate, that gives me the slope.

853
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,953
But of course, what it means to be on our graph is that y is the natural log of x, 

854
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:24,665
which is the same as saying e to the y equals x, 

855
00:53:24,665 --> 00:53:27,820
so this whole thing is the same as taking 1 divided by x.

856
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,016
So if I want to know that slope, I can say, what is your x coordinate, 

857
00:53:32,016 --> 00:53:35,660
take 1 divided by that, and that gets me the slope of the natural log.

858
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,320
Which is, we've just gone through a process called implicit differentiation.

859
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,739
If you're not inclined to believe that this manipulation is legitimate, 

860
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:49,089
that we can just move around the dx's and dy's like that, 

861
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:53,422
I have a whole video about implicit differentiation in the calculus series 

862
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:55,040
that you can take a look at.

863
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,128
But the point for us is that we have a very nice fact, 

864
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:03,200
that the derivative of ln of x looks like 1 divided by x.

865
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,397
And that's quite nice, and it kind of passes a gut check that ln of x gets 

866
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:13,540
shallower and shallower as you go on, which means the slope gets smaller and smaller.

867
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,620
And the graph of 1 over x, you know, what does that look like?

868
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:25,480
Well, at the input, let's say we have the input 1 somewhere like here, it'll be at 1.

869
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,800
At the input 2, it'll be sitting at a half.

870
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,000
At the input 3, it'll be sitting at a third.

871
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,660
And in general, it gets lower and lower and closer to 0.

872
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,354
So the idea that this would describe the slope of that, you know, 

873
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:43,473
something that gets lower and lower closer to 0, 

874
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:45,420
seems to pass a little bit of a sanity check.

875
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,115
Now, the relevance that this is going to have to us 

876
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:52,080
will involve the inverse operation to differentiation.

877
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:58,246
So instead of talking about what is the slope of the natural log curve, 

878
00:54:58,246 --> 00:55:03,900
what I might do is ask about the area under this particular curve.

879
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,720
Let's say I take the area up to...

880
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,880
my stomach was just rumbling, I don't know if that's audible on the microphone.

881
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,180
Clearly, gotta eat lunch before these things.

882
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,160
So let's say I want to understand the area up to n of something like this.

883
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:27,013
What that involves is taking the integral between 

884
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:31,460
1 and our value n of 1 divided by x by dx.

885
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,004
Now this actually looks quite similar in spirit, 

886
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:37,770
the idea of adding up a bunch of things that look like 1 over x, 

887
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,260
to what we were looking at earlier.

888
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,700
How much earlier?

889
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,580
I guess over here.

890
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,180
Where we were adding up 1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth, on and on.

891
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,868
And already it gives a little bit of an intuitive instinct for 

892
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:52,440
why something like this sum would be related to natural logs.

893
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,704
Because we now know that in calculus land, natural logs 

894
00:55:55,704 --> 00:55:58,340
are intimately related to the idea of 1 divided by x.

895
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,663
But I want you to think of this spelled out a little bit more exactly, 

896
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,280
and so we'll pop on over to our quiz one more time.

897
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,100
Second to last question for today.

898
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,100
And the question asks us, we're going to let s be the 

899
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,680
sum from n equals 1 up to capital N of 1 divided by n.

900
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:19,780
That's s.

901
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,868
And then we're going to let i be an analogous integral, 

902
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:27,180
where we're integrating dx over x between 1 and n.

903
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,200
And it asks you to compare s and i.

904
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,040
I'll give you a moment to think about that.

905
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,760
Interestingly, we don't have a ton of consensus around this one.

906
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,840
So there's only three options, and we've got a nice split.

907
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,630
And as you guys know, this is actually one of my favorite things when 

908
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:18,059
we do any of these lockdown live quizzes, is when it's not everyone 

909
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,640
hopping on to one particular thing, but we have a division among folks.

910
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,260
And I think that's great.

911
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:31,020
I'm curious actually what the answer is going to be here.

912
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,320
And in fact, even if it's not been enough time to thoroughly think through, 

913
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,960
I'm going to go ahead and grade it, just so that we can see what it happens to be.

914
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,397
And a lot of the spirit of it is that you kind of hazard a guess, 

915
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:47,340
so feel no shame if you entered an answer and it's not what turns out to be correct.

916
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,220
So in this case, the sum does in fact end up being bigger than the integral.

917
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,040
And it looks like 900 of you got that correct, which is awesome.

918
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,120
And then following that was people thinking that it was less.

919
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,624
And then to those in B thinking that they were identical, you know, 

920
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:08,800
that's a reasonable thought, because they're such similar expressions.

921
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:13,750
But there's a picture that really makes the answer kind of shine out to us here, 

922
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,074
which is, if I look at the curve 1 over x, which is what this white curve is, 

923
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:21,567
it's 1 over x, and then I'm going to consider a bunch of bars, 

924
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:25,060
each of whose area corresponds to 1 over n for some value of n.

925
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:30,719
So for example, for the value 1, this bar has a width of 1, and then the height is 1, 

926
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:35,326
and that means that right above the input 1 on its upper left corner, 

927
00:58:35,326 --> 00:58:36,840
it's hitting the graph.

928
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,735
Now for the next term, if I want 1 over 2, that means it's going to 

929
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:46,245
hit the graph above the input 2, since the graph is defined to be 1 over x, 

930
00:58:46,245 --> 00:58:50,162
so its upper left corner hits that, and then the area of this bar 

931
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:53,960
whose height is 1 half is, well, 1 half, because its width is 1.

932
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,656
Similarly, this bar has an area of 1 third, this bar has an area of 1 fourth, 

933
00:58:58,656 --> 00:59:02,690
and so what you have is a sequence of rectangles whose total area is going 

934
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:06,079
to be similar to the area under the curve, definitely similar, 

935
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,760
but you can tell that it's going to be bigger, because some of the area is leaking out.

936
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,719
In this context, we've got a lot of area leaking out from the first bar, 

937
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,878
a little bit less leaking out from the second, and on and on, 

938
00:59:17,878 --> 00:59:20,272
but as you go, because the graph flattens out, 

939
00:59:20,272 --> 00:59:23,737
it becomes quite a good approximation once you account for the area 

940
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:24,960
that's leaked out there.

941
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,835
Now something kind of bizarre is happening here, 

942
00:59:27,835 --> 00:59:31,504
where usually we think of these rectangles as being something like a Riemann 

943
00:59:31,504 --> 00:59:33,792
sum that defines integration, where we say, oh, 

944
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:37,557
we don't know what the area under a curve is, but we like areas of rectangles, 

945
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:39,940
so we use the rectangles to approximate the curve.

946
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,700
Here, we're going to do something that's backwards to that.

947
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,880
If we know calculus, we do know the area under the curve.

948
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,860
It's very nice.

949
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,940
It involves the antiderivative of 1 over x, like we'll show in a moment.

950
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,980
What we don't know is the sum of the areas of the rectangles.

951
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,260
That was the sum that we were looking at earlier and trying to understand.

952
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,822
So here we're going backwards and using the area under a curve to 

953
00:59:59,822 --> 01:00:03,040
approximate the area of a bunch of rectangles, which I think is fun.

954
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,420
It shows that calculus has this back and forth.

955
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,548
It's not just geometry informing understanding of curves, 

956
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:13,129
but it's an understanding of curves informing an understanding of geometry and number 

957
01:00:13,129 --> 01:00:14,780
theory and things of that sort.

958
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:21,119
So what this means for us is that if we take a look back at our paper and we look at 

959
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,642
my much more sloppily drawn graph than the beautiful exact illustrations can give us, 

960
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:30,367
if we want to understand that area, taking this integral, 

961
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:35,762
the task is to do an inverse derivative, to ask what function has a derivative that 

962
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,240
equals the inside here.

963
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,780
If that's something you haven't learned about, again, calculus series.

964
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,124
Take a look at the fundamental theorem of calculus video, 

965
01:00:44,124 --> 01:00:47,177
or even the first video in that series I think shows a little of 

966
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:50,560
an instinct for why you have this relationship between slopes and areas.

967
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,261
But what it means for us is that we take the inverse derivative, 

968
01:00:55,261 --> 01:00:59,427
which we now know is the natural log, the thing whose derivative is 

969
01:00:59,427 --> 01:01:03,960
1 over x is the natural log, and we evaluate it at the bounds, at n and 1.

970
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:09,049
And this notation where I kind of put brackets around it and then a number 

971
01:01:09,049 --> 01:01:13,530
in the upper right corner and lower right corner means I take that expression 

972
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:17,380
evaluated at the top minus that expression evaluated at the bottom.

973
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:24,700
And that, well, natural log of 1, what is that?

974
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,860
e to the what equals 1?

975
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,600
Well, it's 0.

976
01:01:29,759 --> 01:01:32,300
Pretty much anything to the 0 will equal 1.

977
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:39,040
So this term goes away entirely, and what we're left with is the natural log of n.

978
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:46,956
And what this means for us is if we were using our rectangles to approximate the sum, 

979
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:51,419
or using the integral to approximate those rectangles, 

980
01:01:51,419 --> 01:01:56,773
it's saying that 1 over 1 plus 1 over 2 plus 1 over 3, on and on, 

981
01:01:56,773 --> 01:02:01,560
up to a given bound is about equal to the natural log of n.

982
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:07,861
And more specifically, if you were to account for how much area is leaking out here, 

983
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:10,020
that area actually does converge.

984
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:16,665
As n tends towards infinity, the area that's leaked out approaches a certain constant, 

985
01:02:16,665 --> 01:02:21,782
and it's called Euler's constant, or the Euler-Macheroni constant, 

986
01:02:21,782 --> 01:02:24,380
and it happens to be around 0.577.

987
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,916
So in the same way that pi and e are constants of nature, 

988
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:30,800
this is another constant of nature, also bearing Euler's name.

989
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,629
And what it describes is the deviation between this sum, 

990
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:42,040
often called the harmonic sum, and the natural log of x, a thing that is related to e.

991
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,497
So Euler has really got his fingerprints all over the situation, 

992
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:48,700
at least as far as naming is concerned in our little expression here.

993
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,080
So that's quite nice.

994
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,040
That's quite fun.

995
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,580
But that only answers one of the mysteries that we had earlier.

996
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,879
Because if you remember, I opened this whole thing up by talking not just 

997
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:03,120
about this series that grows like the natural log, we also alternated it.

998
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,970
We went 1 minus a half plus a third minus a fourth, 

999
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,540
and the claim is that that was the natural log of 2.

1000
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,620
So let's see if we can try to understand why that's true.

1001
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:17,393
And I might actually postpone explaining the even more bizarre fact that this 

1002
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:23,184
interrelates with primes in a certain way, depending on how long I want this particular 

1003
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:24,040
stream to go.

1004
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,956
But at least finish off by understanding the alternating series, 

1005
01:03:26,956 --> 01:03:28,200
because it's extremely satisfying.

1006
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,220
So to do that, let me just rewrite what our series looks like.

1007
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:41,004
And this is one of those things where, as I go through the answer, 

1008
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:42,660
it has a feeling of magic.

1009
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,160
And sometimes not in a great way.

1010
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,286
You might find yourself looking at how we go about this and asking, 

1011
01:03:49,286 --> 01:03:51,900
how on earth would anyone ever come up with that?

1012
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:56,799
And maybe after we plop it all down, we can try to introspect and think about the 

1013
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,720
reasonable ways that someone would come up with the following line of reasoning.

1014
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,490
But it is not unique to this situation, it's kind 

1015
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:07,480
of a useful set of tricks to be familiar with.

1016
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,640
And there's a couple general principles in there.

1017
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,198
The first general principle is that if we have a hard question, 

1018
01:04:13,198 --> 01:04:15,960
in this case figuring out what this sum approaches, 

1019
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,040
bizarrely it can become easier if we make it more general.

1020
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,785
You might think that making things more general would make it harder, 

1021
01:04:23,785 --> 01:04:27,040
because you have to answer a more powerful fact.

1022
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:33,013
But math does this bizarre thing, where sometimes by trying to make it more general, 

1023
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:35,360
you actually make the problem more tractable.

1024
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,572
Which is quite cool, actually, because what it means is when a mathematician 

1025
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:44,945
is motivated only by making their own life easier, 

1026
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:49,706
it has the strange effect of making their results applicable to a wider 

1027
01:04:49,706 --> 01:04:51,360
variety of circumstances.

1028
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,418
So the way I'm going to generalize this, again, 

1029
01:04:55,418 --> 01:04:59,940
it might look kind of bizarre and unmotivated, but run with me for a second, 

1030
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:04,462
is rather than thinking of a single value, I'm going to put an x in here and 

1031
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:09,102
consider this a function where I'm taking x over 1 minus x squared over 2 plus 

1032
01:05:09,102 --> 01:05:11,040
x cubed over 3, on and on and on.

1033
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,973
And I want to know, in general, what does this approach for various values of x, 

1034
01:05:15,973 --> 01:05:18,600
and then I just have to plug in the value x equals 1.

1035
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,260
Now, like I said, that might make it seem harder, infinitely harder.

1036
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,133
Previously we just had to know one value, now 

1037
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:25,900
you're asking me to compute infinitely many values?

1038
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:30,116
But if you know calculus, you might recognize that the exponents of 

1039
01:05:30,116 --> 01:05:34,580
your polynomial terms might just play nicely with the denominators here.

1040
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:39,546
And in particular, if we were to take the derivative of this series, 

1041
01:05:39,546 --> 01:05:41,100
it behaves quite nicely.

1042
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,076
The derivative of x is 1, the derivative of x squared over 2, 

1043
01:05:45,076 --> 01:05:49,640
well that 2 hops down and cancels out the denominator, so it becomes negative x.

1044
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,900
Similarly, that 3 hops down and cancels the denominator, so it becomes x squared.

1045
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:01,087
And while you might not know why we're taking a derivative of something here, 

1046
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:06,064
and how that would be helpful for actually evaluating the ultimate sum that 

1047
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:11,696
we care about, it is an interesting fact, and it's something that is playful and fun, 

1048
01:06:11,696 --> 01:06:16,280
that we've somehow simplified the expression by taking its derivative.

1049
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,153
And the simplification is actually quite important, 

1050
01:06:20,153 --> 01:06:24,383
because there's a well-known fact within math that you can take a 

1051
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:29,640
series where each term is the product of the last with a constant kind of product.

1052
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:34,665
So here, as we go from one term to the next, we're always multiplying by negative x, 

1053
01:06:34,665 --> 01:06:38,468
so to go from negative x to x squared, you multiply by negative x, 

1054
01:06:38,468 --> 01:06:43,180
and then similarly x squared to negative x cubed, you're multiplying by negative x.

1055
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:49,086
And when that's the case, the series as a whole is going to approach 1 divided by, 

1056
01:06:49,086 --> 01:06:52,066
or wherever you start, but here we started at 1, 

1057
01:06:52,066 --> 01:06:56,930
so the thing you started at divided by 1 minus the thing that you're constantly 

1058
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,120
multiplying by, which is negative x.

1059
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,087
So to give another example of where this comes up, 

1060
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:09,479
is if we were to take something like 1 plus 1 half plus 1 fourth, 

1061
01:07:09,479 --> 01:07:15,689
where each time in our sequence we are multiplying the last term by 1 half, 

1062
01:07:15,689 --> 01:07:22,880
this will equal 1 divided by 1 minus the thing we were multiplying by, which was 1 half.

1063
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:27,140
And 1 divided by 1 minus 1 half ends up being the same as 2.

1064
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:33,264
And that actually kind of feels intuitive, that if we take 1 plus 1 half plus 1 fourth 

1065
01:07:33,264 --> 01:07:36,507
plus 1 eighth, you could even draw out a picture, 

1066
01:07:36,507 --> 01:07:41,243
where let's say I've got a rectangle whose side length is 1, and 1 here, 

1067
01:07:41,243 --> 01:07:46,044
I can say the 1 represents this area, and then half represents this area, 

1068
01:07:46,044 --> 01:07:50,974
and then a fourth represents this area, and an eighth represents that area, 

1069
01:07:50,974 --> 01:07:55,840
and kind of keep playing this game, and eventually it'll fill an area of 2.

1070
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,886
Now the more general version of that is this geometric sum, 

1071
01:07:59,886 --> 01:08:04,150
which someone who's done a lot of problem solving in math is able to recognize kind 

1072
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:08,212
of quickly, which is why they might enjoy this series much more than they would 

1073
01:08:08,212 --> 01:08:09,380
enjoy the one above it.

1074
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:15,560
So this whole thing ends up looking like 1 divided by 1 plus x.

1075
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:16,560
Great.

1076
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,663
But what this suggests is that if we somehow take an antiderivative, 

1077
01:08:21,663 --> 01:08:26,949
if we somehow integrate this, we might have an alternate expression for what the 

1078
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:28,319
initial sequence was.

1079
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,285
So from here, I'm going to go ahead and pose a quiz, 

1080
01:08:32,285 --> 01:08:38,421
and part of this quiz is seeing who in the audience is comfortable with calculus, 

1081
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:43,060
and again if you're not, calculus series, go and check it out.

1082
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:48,194
But what we have here is the question, what is the 

1083
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:52,740
integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x, dx?

1084
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:59,120
I want you to evaluate that integral, and I'll give you a little moment for this one.

1085
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,180
So, let's see.

1086
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,185
And you know, tell you what, while answers are rolling in, before locking it in, 

1087
01:09:44,185 --> 01:09:46,560
I'm going to go ahead and just start describing the answer here.

1088
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:54,149
So, if you want to know the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x, dx, 

1089
01:09:54,149 --> 01:10:00,997
well we know that the antiderivative of 1 over x is the natural log of x, 

1090
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:08,401
so it's going to be the natural log of that inside divided by the derivative of 

1091
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:09,420
the inside.

1092
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,700
That's kind of the inverse chain rule, or something you can get with u-substitution.

1093
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,299
But the derivative of the inside is just 1, so you can check yourself that if 

1094
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:19,852
you take the derivative of this, you get 1 over the inside, 1 over 1 plus x, 

1095
01:10:19,852 --> 01:10:23,360
but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1, so it stays the same.

1096
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,570
So then we evaluate this at the bounds, 1 and 0, 

1097
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:32,363
and what this ends up getting us is the natural log at the top, 

1098
01:10:32,363 --> 01:10:38,880
which is 1 plus 1, minus the natural log of 1 plus x at the bottom, which was 1 plus 0.

1099
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,038
The natural log of 1 plus 1 is of course ln of 2, 

1100
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,980
and then we're subtracting off the natural log of 1, which is 0.

1101
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,720
So, the proper answer here comes out to be the natural log of 2.

1102
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,803
And it looks like 1600 of you have correctly answered that, 

1103
01:10:56,803 --> 01:10:58,500
so well done, well done indeed.

1104
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:04,286
And if you wanted to kind of visualize this in your head or get some sort of gut 

1105
01:11:04,286 --> 01:11:08,121
instinct on which of those answers seemed loosely correct, 

1106
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:11,827
even if you didn't know how to calculate it immediately, 

1107
01:11:11,827 --> 01:11:16,963
the graph of 1 over 1 plus x is going to look just like the graph of 1 over x, 

1108
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:22,164
but shifted to the left, so it's actually going to pass through the input 0, 1, 

1109
01:11:22,164 --> 01:11:25,220
and then we're looking for the area under here.

1110
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,706
So you know that it's going to be an area somewhere between 0 and 1, 

1111
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:34,717
probably filling up more than a half of it, and the natural log of 2 is around 0.69, 

1112
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:36,780
so that actually seems about right.

1113
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,832
But what's quite cool here is that if we say that the, 

1114
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:49,796
well I can just write it out again here, if I say I want to integrate 

1115
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:56,960
this bottom expression from 0 up to 1, which is the same as integrating 

1116
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:04,920
1 over 1 plus x from 0 up to 1, I know that that should be the value 2, ln of 2.

1117
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:06,440
Okay?

1118
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,079
But on the other hand, if I picture taking my antiderivative and getting this 

1119
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,467
whole sequence here, and evaluating it between 0 and 1, 

1120
01:12:15,467 --> 01:12:20,731
what I'm doing is I'm plugging in the number 1, which gets me my alternating sequence, 

1121
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:25,451
then I'm subtracting off the value of 0, which when I plug it in just gets 0, 

1122
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:29,928
so evaluating this at 0 and 1 is the same thing as integrating the bottom 

1123
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:34,708
expression from 0 to 1, which is the same thing as integrating 1 over 1 plus x 

1124
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,673
from 0 to 1, which is the same thing as ln of 2, 

1125
01:12:37,673 --> 01:12:40,880
and hence that whole top thing ends up being ln of 2.

1126
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:41,900
Very clever!

1127
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,458
Just such a sneaky sequence of manipulations that, like I said, 

1128
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:49,137
if you just see it plopped down, almost as intimidating because you wonder, 

1129
01:12:49,137 --> 01:12:53,203
how on earth do you go from seeing this sequence up here to thinking about, ah yes, 

1130
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:57,221
if I generalize it with lots of powers of x and then take the derivatives of those 

1131
01:12:57,221 --> 01:13:01,287
and then use a geometric series sum and then integrate that using natural log, yes, 

1132
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:02,740
then it'll all become obvious.

1133
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,141
And I think the answer is that that's probably 

1134
01:13:05,141 --> 01:13:06,940
not what the problem solving process looks like.

1135
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,113
Instead, you build up a familiarity with a lot of these things, 

1136
01:13:10,113 --> 01:13:12,826
like derivatives of polynomial terms, and then you build up 

1137
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:15,720
familiarity with other things, like derivatives of natural logs.

1138
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,296
And the more familiarity you have with a lot of different pieces of math, 

1139
01:13:19,296 --> 01:13:21,584
then sometimes when you see one particular pattern, 

1140
01:13:21,584 --> 01:13:25,500
you're able to draw in your mind a connection to things that make you look like a genius.

1141
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,480
I think Euler did this all the time.

1142
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,150
If you look at some of the great discoveries of Euler, 

1143
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,880
they just come really out of nowhere.

1144
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,854
I mean the very opening thing that I talked about, 

1145
01:13:35,854 --> 01:13:40,320
I guess it wasn't the very opening, but early on, where are we?

1146
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,500
I seem to have...

1147
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:49,110
The sum of the reciprocals of squares, which, somewhere in my notebook here, 

1148
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:51,500
we were just looking at the pages.

1149
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,100
Maybe I tore it out.

1150
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,639
Oh, yeah, there we are.

1151
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,960
Things can become a little bit of a mess over here.

1152
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,028
But if we look at this long sum where we're taking 1 over 1 squared, 

1153
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:08,595
1 over 2 squared, and equals pi squared over 6, the way that Euler found this, 

1154
01:14:08,595 --> 01:14:12,527
I mean, it involves this very strange thing where you start looking 

1155
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:15,880
at an infinite product associated with sine of pi times x.

1156
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,080
And if you think of it as starting with this sum and then dreaming up out of your head 

1157
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,783
an infinite product associated with sine of pi times x, 

1158
01:14:22,783 --> 01:14:26,162
or it might have been cotangent of pi times x or something like that, 

1159
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,480
it really does seem like it came out of nowhere.

1160
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:35,461
But in general, I think you build up these bits of familiarity with different pieces, 

1161
01:14:35,461 --> 01:14:41,515
and then once you see something, like Euler seeing that Basel problem sum or 

1162
01:14:41,515 --> 01:14:48,041
someone seeing this alternating harmonic sum, you're able to use those connections 

1163
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:53,860
to kind of make yourself look smarter than you actually are, which is fun.
