00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's go ahead and open things up today with a question that might seem like it's incredibly unrelated to the title of the video.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
So if you guys go to 3b1b.co.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,200
Live, link is in the description. You've all been there for some of the warm-up animations.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,080
I want you to just make an estimate for the following question.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,120
It looks like a couple of you have already started coming in with answers here.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,360
Consider the numbers between 1 trillion and a trillion plus a thousand. Okay, so this range of a thousand integers

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,960
that's pretty high. Which of the following would you guess is closest to the proportion of these numbers that are prime?

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,840
So if you were to go through the painstaking process of, you know,

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,720
looking at all of those numbers between a trillion and a trillion plus a thousand, considering which of them are prime,

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,280
what do you guess is the relevant proportion there? So don't worry about getting it right or wrong.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm mostly curious where people's intuitions are on this one.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,440
So while we don't necessarily have to do those painstaking calculations,

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,880
I have gone ahead and written up a simple program that can do that for us.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,560
So if we hop on over to Python, it's not exactly the most sophisticated program for getting primes in the world,

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,480
but it'll get the job done for us. So if I type something like get primes between 0 and 50,

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,160
you know, we take a look. Okay, it's got 2, 3, 5, 7, all your favorite prime numbers between 0 and 50,

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,080
you're gonna find in there. But maybe you don't like that range. Maybe you want to look between a thousand and a thousand fifty.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,160
And there you go. There's the primes between a thousand and a thousand fifty.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,160
And there's fewer of them. In general, as you get bigger and bigger, the primes get sparser and sparser,

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,040
essentially because each one has more options for what it could factor into. You know,

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,960
if you're just doing the guess and check on something like 143, you just have to check all the numbers up to around its square root.

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,360
Whereas if you're checking around a trillion, you have to check on the order of,

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,360
you know, something like a million numbers, all the primes up to a million, whether or not they go into it.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,240
So you might think that when we, let's say we define the list where we're going to get all of the primes,

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,760
you know, get the primes between a trillion, which is 10 to the 12th, and a trillion

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
plus a thousand.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,200
This involves a lot of number crunching to actually find those primes. And you can see by the fact that, you know,

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,880
the program I wrote isn't going to be the most efficient thing in the world.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,200
It takes a little bit of time before it gets there.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,400
So we can look at that list in just a moment.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,880
But before I want to properly take a look at what everybody thinks. And we have a great split!

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, I love questions that split up the audience like this. That's always fun. So what do you think?

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
What do you think is the actual density of primes up there?

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,200
Ooh, the correct answer is only third place. Usually in lockdown math, the correct answer is always at top.

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,120
So this is exciting for me. It seems like most, or

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
the largest number of people thought that D, one out of

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,280
250, that there would only be four primes in that range.

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,120
After that, it was people who thought only one in a thousand, that up there, you know, primes are so rare

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,800
they only come one in every thousand. The correct answer,

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,840
the closest proportion here, would have been one in 25.

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,280
So a lot more frequent than people might have thought. And what's interesting is actually if you ask this question to a mathematician,

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,000
they would be able to pretty quickly tell you what the correct answer is, not because they're doing all that number crunching. And in fact,

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,120
if you were to talk to a mathematician, they would look at this problem

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,400
they would do a small little calculation in their head and they'd say, the closest is one in 25,

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,800
but really it's going to be closer to, you know, one in every 27 or 28. That would be a bit more accurate.

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,160
You might wonder how they do that.

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,600
Because if we look at the number crunching that our computer had to do, it had to check all of the potential factors for all

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,680
of the numbers we were looking at, and it does give us all of the primes between a trillion and a trillion plus a thousand.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,880
So you can see they're, they're sparser than they are for just the numbers between zero and a thousand.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,280
But there's a meaningful number of them. You know, we've got

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:55,080
1 trillion 751, 1 trillion 787. The Boeing engineers are probably pleased that that's in there. And the actual length of that list is

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,760
37. So there's 37 primes in there. So the proportion out of the thousand is

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
0.37. Or the way we were phrasing it, it was one out of something,

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,520
so we might take the reciprocal of that and do a thousand divided by the number in there. And it's about one in every

55
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,960
27. But what the mathematician would do is they would say, I know this very cute fact about prime numbers,

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,600
which is that the density of prime numbers near a given value, like a trillion, is around the natural log.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,520
So I'm going to type math dot log here, which takes a natural logarithm of that number. And we can, you know,

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,960
check if you want, what does the documentation tell us.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,760
It says this returns the logarithm of x to a given base. If the base is not specified, it returns the natural logarithm,

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
which is log base e of x.

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,400
And just as a reminder, if anyone needs a little reminding on what logarithms mean, we talked about this all in the last lecture,

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,000
so feel free to pop over. But when you have an expression like l in x, which is telling us the log with base e of x,

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,800
equals y, that is saying the same thing as e to the power y equals x. It's asking the question e to the what equals x.

64
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
So for example,

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,160
the natural log of 10, it's around 2.3.

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,360
And that's a kind of useful value to know if you want to make conversions between

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,160
exponentials written with e versus exponentials written with 10, but the natural log of 10 is around 2.3.

68
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,600
So that's saying the same thing as e to the 2.3 equals 10. Now the cutesy fact here is that prime numbers,

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,380
their density is actually kind of related to this natural logarithm. If we went over and we took

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,280
the natural log of a trillion, which was the number defining our range at the lower end of that range,

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,480
you'd see that it's 27. And that was about the

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,040
the ratio we were looking at before, right? A thousand divided by the length of our list of primes.

73
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,240
I mean, that's that's quite close.

74
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,400
And the fact that

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,860
that happens at all is, I don't, I might not call that my favorite piece of math because I use that term a lot,

76
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,320
but it's definitely going to make the list of top five favorite pieces of math. That the log with base e

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,920
has anything to do with prime numbers.

78
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,760
So I want to show you another kind of cute fact associated with

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,760
the relationship between natural logs and primes, because you might wonder why is it that we call this thing the natural logarithm?

80
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,880
There's lots of logarithms, lots of different bases.

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,220
What makes this one more natural? And I think the more often you see it show up in nature,

82
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,380
the more that name starts to kind of make sense. So I'm going to play a game that will seem truly strange for a moment.

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm going to take an infinite series,

84
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,860
for example one that's, you know, a favorite among a lot of people. If you take 1 over 1 plus 1 over 4 plus 1

85
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,760
over 9 plus 1 over 16, and in general you're always taking 1 over n squared, and you add up all of those numbers,

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
if you keep adding and adding them,

87
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,120
they'll stay below a certain bound and they'll actually approach a certain number. And it was this open question in Europe,

88
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,740
it was posed in Basel by I think one of the Bernoulli's for a while, like what is the number that this equals, and

89
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,660
eventually Euler, genius of the day, was able to prove that it equals pi squared divided by 6,

90
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,800
which is very beautiful, the idea that pi is it all related to

91
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,700
just adding up the reciprocals of squares. But it gets crazier than that. I'm going to play this weird game

92
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,780
that's going to kick out terms that don't look like prime numbers, keep the prime numbers, and then

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,100
also scale down ones that are sufficiently prime similar for us.

94
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,820
I'll show you what I mean. So 1 is not at all a prime. We're not even going to include it.

95
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,500
2 is a prime, so I'm going to keep that 1 over 2 squared term. 3 is a prime,

96
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,220
so I'm going to keep the 1 over 3 squared term. 4, it's not a prime.

97
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,860
But I'm not going to kick it out because it is the power of a prime.

98
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,360
So I'm going to say that 1 over 4 squared term can stay, but because you're only the square of a prime,

99
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm going to scale you down by a half. Okay?

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,880
It's kind of a way of saying you look sort of like a prime, but because you're only a power of it,

101
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I'm scaling you down by that power.

102
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
5 is a prime, so we keep the fifth term.

103
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,120
6, not a prime, not a power of a prime. We don't like it at all. It gets kicked out.

104
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,480
7, we keep it. And you can sort of see where I'm going here,

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,200
but I'll write a couple more examples because it's such a bizarre way to manipulate a series.

106
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,480
You would think that this isn't going to get us anything nice at all.

107
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,120
8, it's a power of a prime, but because it's a cube, I'm going to scale it down by a factor of 3.

108
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,240
So I'm going to take 1 third of the eighth term.

109
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,680
9, it's the square of a prime, so I'll take 1 half of the ninth term. 10 gets kicked out, we ignore it entirely.

110
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:42,440
11 stays as is, and on and on. So each one of your terms looks like the power of a prime.

111
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,040
1 over pk, and because this series, we're squaring them all, it's 1 over the power of that prime squared.

112
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,080
But we scale it down by whatever that power is.

113
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,740
Alright, now because we've manipulated this in a pretty chaotic way,

114
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,120
I mean the primes are distributed in a pretty random fashion, you might think that this is completely uncomputable.

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
It's just a crazy situation.

116
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,460
It's going to be smaller, you know, for sure

117
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,780
it's going to be smaller than the pi squared over 6, because we left out the 1, we left out a lot of composite numbers,

118
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,580
and prime powers bigger than, with a power bigger than 1, we scaled down. So it's definitely a smaller number.

119
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,700
You might be able to guess where this is going based on the title of the video.

120
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,060
What it ends up equaling is the natural log of what it was before, of pi squared over 6.

121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,700
And that's not just true for this particular sequence of sums of squares.

122
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:40,660
There's a number of other formulas that get us something related to pi,

123
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,260
which is evidently related to primes, in a way that's, um,

124
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:51,460
I mean, you play the same game and you have this weird fashion of taking logarithms, and not just any logarithm, the log base e.

125
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,500
So just to talk through what I mean in this other context,

126
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,580
if you take 1 minus a third plus a fifth minus a seventh plus a ninth and kind of alternate back and forth between the odd numbers,

127
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,860
you get pi divided by 4. I have a video all about this. Mathologer also has a video about it, if you're curious. Very beautiful why it's true.

128
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,420
But even stranger is when we play this game of keeping the primes and kicking out others.

129
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,500
So 1 we're going to kick out. If we keep the third term, that's negative 3.

130
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,580
Then the 5 we keep that. The 7, I guess it's a minus 1 7th.

131
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,300
The 9, we keep it but we scale it down because it's the square of a prime.

132
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,660
And in this case, because we're only looking at odd numbers,

133
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,500
it looks like we're keeping quite a few of them. We have to get bigger before we kick them out.

134
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
So like 15, that gets kicked out.

135
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,700
17 is positive, it gets to stay as is.

136
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,940
19 gets to stay as is.

137
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,620
21 gets kicked out.

138
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,300
23 gets to stay.

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,060
So a very bizarre thing. I mean, now the pluses and minuses, they don't alternate nicely.

140
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,300
It's like minus plus, minus plus, minus plus, plus, minus, minus.

141
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,420
It's a, um, it almost seems like a random sequence.

142
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,940
25, we can scale that down because it's 5 squared.

143
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,340
1 over 25.

144
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,780
And this doesn't equal pi fourths anymore, but it does equal the natural logarithm of pi fourths.

145
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,580
So evidently there's this relationship between taking logarithms with base e,

146
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,820
which is to say answering the question e to the what equals a value,

147
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,420
and, um, these sort of prime patterns.

148
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,620
And it's quite beautiful when you think about it, because if you look at like this entire sequence up here,

149
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,180
it's going to equal some number such that e to that number is related to pi.

150
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,300
So you have this formula that's interrelating all of the prime numbers,

151
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,660
and their powers for that matter,

152
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,300
excluding the composite, so it's still a cool sequence, it's not just like all the integers.

153
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,780
We're taking e, raising e to the power of that sum, and you get something related to pi.

154
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,580
I mean, clearly better than Euler's formula. I think you'd have to agree.

155
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,620
So, we might at the end of the lesson get to why that's true.

156
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,460
It'll depend on how much time there is,

157
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,820
but the next two facts I'll show you we will definitely explain why they're true.

158
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,860
So we're going to play a couple more games with series here.

159
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,380
These ones are going to be a little bit simpler facts to think about than the first two that I showed,

160
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,700
but the relation with primes is just, oh man, if that doesn't make you love math, I don't know what would.

161
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,020
But if we played an alternating game that doesn't go through all the odd numbers,

162
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,540
but it goes through every number.

163
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,740
So I'm going to take one minus a half plus a third minus a fourth on and on,

164
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,980
and you might visualize this with a number line where I'm going between zero and one here.

165
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,500
When we take one minus a half, you're hopping backwards by a half,

166
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,260
and then plus a third, you're hopping forward by a smaller amount,

167
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,540
minus a fourth, you hop backwards by a still smaller amount,

168
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,500
then plus a fifth, and then backwards might get you here,

169
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
and then forward might get you something like that,

170
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,180
and you're alternating back and forth, and because each one is smaller than the last,

171
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,460
you can probably see that it has to zero in on some kind of value.

172
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,700
And as a matter of fact, it does.

173
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,300
It zeros in on a value that's around 0.69 or so,

174
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,580
and more precisely, it comes in on the natural log of two.

175
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,580
The answer to the question e to what is equal to two.

176
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Kind of strange, don't you think?

177
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,340
That something like e would show up with relation to just odd numbers

178
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,780
oscillating back and forth like this.

179
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,940
And there's another relation that natural logarithms have

180
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,700
to a sequence that looks like this.

181
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,300
You might ask what happens if we don't alternate back and forth,

182
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
but we add them all together, right?

183
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,660
What does that approach?

184
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,300
Because in the same way that, you know, when we added all the squares,

185
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,980
the sum of the reciprocals of the squares,

186
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,700
that approached a beautiful thing, it was pi squared over six,

187
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,780
you might think an even more natural question to ask is don't square them at all.

188
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,820
Take one plus a half plus a third plus a fourth, on and on.

189
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,420
What is this approach?

190
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,260
Now as it happens, it actually, it doesn't approach anything.

191
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,140
No matter how small a number you choose,

192
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,620
this sequence is eventually going to get bigger than it.

193
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,940
So I could say keep adding terms and eventually you'll get bigger than 100.

194
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,020
If you have some patience, keep adding terms and eventually you'll get bigger than a million.

195
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,260
And that's kind of surprising because each one of these numbers is getting smaller and smaller.

196
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,620
So as you're making your additions, you would think it's going to slow down.

197
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,380
It won't get you past something like 100.

198
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,180
But I can explain to you why this is going to happen.

199
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,020
It's actually a very pretty proof.

200
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,220
If I group my terms appropriately, so I'm going to group a third and a fourth together,

201
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,340
I'm going to group all the numbers between a fifth and an eighth,

202
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,540
all of the numbers between a ninth and a sixteenth,

203
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,460
all of the numbers between one over 17 and one over 32.

204
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,540
So into these groups that grow in size by powers of two,

205
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,620
what I can say is that a third plus a fourth,

206
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,500
well both of those numbers are bigger than a fourth,

207
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,460
a third is bigger than a fourth, and well a fourth isn't bigger but it's exactly equal to,

208
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,460
but that does mean that their sum,

209
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,740
yeah their sum is definitely going to be bigger than one fourth times one fourth,

210
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,380
which is the same as taking two times a fourth.

211
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,900
Similarly, this sum here, one fifth plus one sixth plus one seventh plus one eighth,

212
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,620
each one of those terms is bigger than an eighth.

213
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,300
All four of those terms are bigger than one eighth.

214
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,980
So the group of them together is bigger than four eighths.

215
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,420
Similarly over here, all of the numbers between a ninth and a sixteenth,

216
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,700
all eight of those numbers are bigger than one in 16,

217
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,100
so the sum all together is bigger than eight times one over 16.

218
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,300
And you might see where I'm going with this, you know, here I have

219
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,420
16 numbers that are all bigger than one in 30, excuse me,

220
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,420
bigger than one in 32, talking while writing,

221
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,660
and of course all of these are just equal to one half,

222
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,060
so this two fourths is the same as a half, four eighths is the same as a half,

223
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,660
eight sixteenths, that's a half.

224
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,300
So in other words what I can do is group all of my terms so that the sum instead looks like taking

225
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,900
one plus a half plus a half plus a half on and on forever.

226
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,260
And that you can see, okay if I keep going sufficiently long it is going to get bigger.

227
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,260
And it also gives you a little instinct that this might actually be related to logarithms,

228
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,820
because the size of our groupings grow according to powers of two.

229
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,820
So if you're wondering how long do I have to go before this sum gets bigger than 10,

230
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,060
you might have the instinct that, hmm, I'm going to have to add together,

231
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,340
let's see, I have one and then the rest of them are halves,

232
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,380
so I'm going to have to add together 18 different groups that each look like a half,

233
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,020
so I might have to get up to the point where the size of my group is like two to the 17th,

234
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,260
something like that.

235
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,820
And you would be spot on that it grows, well it doesn't grow exponentially,

236
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,100
it grows logarithmically, because if you're asking how far do you need to go in order to get to that

237
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,860
point, it would be logarithmic.

238
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,060
And as you might guess, it's actually the natural logarithm.

239
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,420
So if I add up all of the terms to about 1 over n,

240
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,900
it ends up being approximately the natural log of n.

241
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,660
And if you want to get even more accurate, it's the natural log of n plus a certain constant,

242
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,100
this is a constant we'll talk about later on in the lesson.

243
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,260
But just for an order of approximation,

244
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,100
this gives you the idea that you need to get up to around the natural log of n.

245
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,540
So I'm going to go ahead and pull up the quiz and ask you another question,

246
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,940
just to see if you've been paying attention so far.

247
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,100
So our question asks, which of the following is closest to the smallest value of n

248
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,500
for which the sum 1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth on and on,

249
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,180
you keep adding until you get 1 over n.

250
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
How long do you have to go until that sum is bigger than a million?

251
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,460
Okay, so remember your first instinct here might have been that this entire sum

252
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,620
converges to something in the same way that when you add the reciprocals of squares,

253
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,660
it converges to pi squared divided by 6, very beautiful.

254
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,380
You might have thought that you keep going to this and it converges.

255
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,420
In fact, what happens is it'll always get larger,

256
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,260
but you can be more quantitative than that.

257
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,660
And you can ask, how long does it take before this gets larger than a million?

258
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,060
So I'll give you a little bit of time to think through what the answer to that will be.

259
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:22,540
And I will say, because we're kind of converting between E-related things and base 10-related

260
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,140
things, if you wanted a little reminder, I can pull up the fact that the natural log

261
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,700
is around 2.3, if you wanted to use that for estimation purposes.

262
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,620
So just to see if you were paying attention to the result that I've just described of this

263
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,020
thing growing like a natural logarithm, let's see how you answer.

264
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:56,300
And I'll give another 20 seconds or so here.

265
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:06,300
So

266
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,740
all right, even if you're not necessarily finished, I'll go ahead and see where people

267
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,020
are on this one, lock in the answers, and then explain where it comes from.

268
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,660
So the correct answer is that it's around 10 to the 400,000 or so, which is a huge,

269
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,220
huge number. The estimated number of atoms in the universe is around 10 to the 80th.

270
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,380
So it would be as if each atom in the universe had a universe inside of it, that would get us to

271
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,260
10 to the 160, then each one of those had a universe inside it, that only gets us to

272
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,100
10 to the 240. You'd have to keep iterating like that over and over.

273
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,820
And even that crazy idea, like mental thought for how you can get up to a big number,

274
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,980
would take forever to get you to something of the size 10 to the 400,000.

275
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,220
All right, now the way that you would think about something like this is to take a look at what I

276
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,940
just said. When we add up all these numbers up to the point 1 over n, it's about the natural log of

277
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,540
n. So what you're looking for is the value when the natural log of n is approximately a million.

278
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,340
That's how long you have to go before the sum gets bigger than a million.

279
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,820
This is the same statement as saying that n is about e to the power of a million.

280
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,260
Okay, but of all of our answers we're expressed in terms of powers of 10.

281
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,940
So in order to make the conversion, I would think to myself, 10 to the what is equal to e?

282
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,060
That way I'm going to be able to make a little substitution in here with the power of 10.

283
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,820
Well, this is asking me what is the log base 10 of e?

284
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,380
And from properties of logarithms like what we learned last time,

285
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:59,900
this is the same as asking log base e of 10, but we're taking the reciprocal of that.

286
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:09,100
Okay, and another way you could think about that is that e to the 1 over x equals 10.

287
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,780
That these two expressions are the same, so we're looking for the natural log of 10,

288
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,980
but we take 1 over it. Now our estimation for the natural log of 10, if you happen to know,

289
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,940
it's around 2.3. All you would really need to know for this one is like that it's roughly 2,

290
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,380
or even that it's on the order of 1, because all the exponents in our options were looking

291
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,700
very different. So if you're asking what's 1 divided by 2.3, I mean very roughly, it's like

292
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,580
like a half. So we could think of n as being very very roughly something that's like 10 to the 1

293
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:49,980
half to the 1 million, just to get us something kind of close. So that looks like it's 10 to the

294
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,220
500,000, and we know that that one half really should be a little bit smaller because we're

295
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,940
taking 1 divided by 2.3, not 1 divided by 2, so the number should be something a little smaller

296
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,540
than 500,000. And indeed, of all the options here, there's one that's much closer to 10 to

297
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,940
500,000 than anything else, so our like very rough approximation would get us there.

298
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,260
All right, so that's pretty fun. Now to start explaining where on earth some of these things

299
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,660
are coming from, like why is the natural log present in these circumstances, I want to take

300
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,780
a moment to start talking about e and the role that e plays in math in a way that I think sometimes

301
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,420
it can be a little bit misunderstood. So just to start off, I'm going to pick a number from the

302
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:35,180
audience, so in your own time feel free to go to 3b1b.co and enter whatever your favorite number is.

303
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,140
But the thing I want to talk about to begin here is how, lots of answers coming in, that's always

304
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,820
fun. When you see a family of functions, okay, so let's say we see something that looks like,

305
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:55,340
I'll pop on over here, something that looks like e to the r times x for various different values of

306
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,140
r. This is something you see all the time in engineering and math and physics, we describe

307
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,460
a bunch of different exponentials with some kind of parameter like r sitting there, and we say

308
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,780
depending on what r is this can give us a shallower exponential growth, something that grows

309
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:15,340
exponentially but a little bit more slowly, versus a steep exponential growth. Okay, once you're

310
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,500
writing things in terms of a family, I think a lot of people have this instinct that like these are

311
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,900
all of the functions that e produces, like e the number is producing this beautiful family of

312
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,700
functions. But it's important to realize this is the same statement as creating a family of

313
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,060
functions that just like look like a to the x with various different bases, where it could tweak what

314
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,260
that value of a is and say you know sometimes it looks like 2 to the power x, sometimes it looks

315
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,020
like 3 to the power x, okay, or 4 to the power x. Tweaking that base gets us various different

316
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,740
exponentials, that's actually playing the same game for any one that you have here like you know

317
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:57,580
the function 3 to the x, taking powers of 3. I can choose an r such that e to the r x equals that,

318
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,220
and in fact there's nothing special about e. I could have chosen as the base here something

319
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,740
like pi. I could say look at the family of exponentials that look like pi to the r times x.

320
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,860
It's not that pi is producing these numbers or pi is related to this family in a particular way,

321
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,660
it's a choice that we're making to write it that way. And almost always the choice that we make

322
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,900
in physics and engineering and math all over the place to write families of exponentials is with e.

323
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,780
So the right question to ask isn't what does e have to do with such a family,

324
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,580
but why is it the right choice? I'll give you another example of where this can come up.

325
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,660
I mean they're all over the place, things that look like exponential curves,

326
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,620
but one that's very important for probability and statistics is the bell curve. So it's something

327
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:48,380
that we almost always write in the form e to the negative x squared. And a way you might think

328
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,500
about this by the way is you know if we take just e to the x we get this thing that grows and it

329
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,700
kind of decays as you go to the left, and if we made it negative it would decay as you go to the

330
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,220
right. So whenever the input to e to the x is getting very negative it decays. So to make it

331
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,020
decay on both sides you could take e to the negative x squared and then it's decaying on

332
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,900
both sides and you get this nice bell curve. And because of that square it sort of smooths things

333
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,260
out whereas if we had taken something like the you know the absolute value of x but negated it

334
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,900
okay then it decays on both sides but we get this awkward cusp. That doesn't explain why this very

335
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,140
specific curve comes up in statistics but if you ever kind of want to remember oh what was the

336
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,380
what was the formula for a bell curve again you can kind of think through the fact that this

337
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,540
should have roughly that shape. And quite often it comes with some kind of parameters though.

338
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,140
For example I could put in something maybe a value I'll call s in there that will determine how wide

339
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,740
and skinny this bell curve is something like a standard deviation in the context of statistics.

340
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,780
s wouldn't be that standard deviation we would have to reciprocate it and square it and do some

341
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,940
things but the idea that when you tweak what's in that exponent it changes the bell curve. That's the

342
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,060
only point I want to make here. You can think just looking at this that somehow bell curves are

343
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,100
produced by the number e but that's not exactly true because I could also write a to the negative

344
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:16,380
x squared and I get the same family of curves as I tweak the value of a I'm also changing what that

345
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,780
width is so I could come up with other ways of describing the standard deviation of this in terms

346
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,260
of a and it's it's the same family of curves it's not just that they look similar they are in fact

347
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,260
the same thing. And this is not too hard to show algebraically it almost makes it look a little bit

348
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,660
more deceptively simple than it really is. So we've got a lot of answers for what people wanted

349
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,580
to enter as an example number to go with so let's go ahead and see. It seems like the most popular

350
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,940
answer by a little margin above i is 69 which I assume is because if you take all of the natural

351
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,420
numbers between 1 and 9 and then you look at the divisors for each one of those look at the numbers

352
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:59,100
you list all their divisors and you add up the divisors it adds up to 69 and adding up divisors

353
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,020
like this is a very fun and common thing in number theory so I assume that's why people

354
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:09,420
chose it but the point here is that if you see some kind of function like let's see how should

355
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:17,340
I write it 69 to the power x I could also write that I could write the same thing as e to the

356
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,820
power of the natural log of 69 okay that's I've written that kind of sloppily let me do it again

357
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:32,300
e to the natural log of 69 that's the same thing as the number 69 right because it's saying

358
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,460
e to the what equals 69 but then I've taken e to that so I should get 69 back

359
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,580
all of that to the power x and by the rules of exponentials this is the same thing as e to

360
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,900
just some constant whatever the natural log of 69 is times x so I could replace that with a constant

361
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,820
which happens to be around 4.234 as any mathematician will be able to tell you well

362
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:03,260
known constant of nature the natural log of 69 and the point here is that this just looks like e

363
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,740
to some constant times x so you might wonder why do we make this choice right because it didn't

364
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,540
have to be pi I could write that same function sorry it didn't have to be e I could write that

365
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:21,740
same function as pi raised to a special power namely the log base pi and I'm writing quite

366
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,420
sloppily here log base pi of 69 times x that would be the same function we could describe everything

367
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:35,020
with a base of pi if we wanted to and to just give one more example of where I think this even though

368
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,460
it's a like it's a simple conversion if you know logarithms that anything that looks like a to the

369
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:47,900
x can be expressed as e to something times that I think it's clearly not very appreciated that you

370
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,660
can make that conversion because anytime that we talk about imaginary exponentials and I get that

371
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:59,260
it's kind of a weird thing to talk about e to the i times t once someone learns you know and I've

372
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,180
made a number of videos in this series about it Mathologer has videos lots of people have videos

373
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:09,980
about it the idea is that e to the imaginary constant times some value t walks you around the

374
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:18,620
unit circle and in fact it walks you a distance of t radians okay and the importance of this the way

375
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,340
that it comes up in for example electrical engineering is it gives you this oscillating

376
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,580
pattern as you scale up t you have something that's oscillating and it gives a very nice way

377
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,780
to describe sine waves and cosine waves and signals that oscillate and there's actually one

378
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,660
electrical engineer that I used to know and he would always say oh I love the number e what I

379
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,140
like about e is it's the number that spins that's really what makes e special I realized this e is

380
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,620
the number that spins but the problem is that's not that's not exactly true what it is true that

381
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:56,060
e to the it spins around but that's not special to e I could also take 2 to the i times t and that

382
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,820
will also produce values that walk around a circle and we can think through more exactly 2 is the

383
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:09,740
same thing as e to the natural log of 2 so 2 to the it is the same as e to the natural log of 2

384
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,340
times t all of that times the imaginary number i which basically means it's doing the same thing

385
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,940
as e to the it it's just rescaling time it's walking a little bit more slowly and then similarly

386
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,780
if you were to take something like your favorite number to the i times t that would look like e to

387
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:35,020
the approximately 4.234 times t all times the imaginary number which just means you're walking

388
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,700
around at a different rate so e is not the number that spins the idea of complex exponents walking

389
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,060
around a circle doesn't have to do with e per se it really just has to do with a lot of what we

390
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,780
talked about I think in lectures four and five and I'll go over it again in just a moment here

391
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:57,260
as a quick reminder so the thing that's special about e the reason that we always choose to write

392
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,220
things in this way has to do with rates of change that when you take the derivative

393
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:13,340
of e to the power t right this is the same thing as itself which is to say if we were to graph this

394
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,100
you know maybe e to the t represents an amount of money you have over time or something like that

395
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,340
and we were to look above a value of t the slope of this graph the rate at which it's increasing

396
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,820
is actually equal to its own height so the farther you are along the curve meaning you

397
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,340
have a greater height the steeper it is so you know the more money you have the faster it grows

398
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,220
this is the power of compound growth but that's actually true of any exponential what makes e

399
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,380
special is that they're exactly the same it's not just that they grow in proportion with each other

400
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:54,140
so if we were to write a family of exponential curves as e to the r times t as opposed to writing

401
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:00,700
it as a to the power t and thinking of changing that value a the value in doing that is that taking

402
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,700
the derivative by the chain rule we take the derivative of the inside which looks like r

403
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,700
and we multiply by the derivative of the outside which is e to the r t and if anybody here doesn't

404
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,340
know calculus by the way we're about to start doing a fair amount of it i have a whole series

405
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,260
on it that you can pop over and take a look at lots of other places on youtube and such to give

406
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,140
a quick primer but if you're coming in and you're not familiar with calculus like just be warned that

407
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,220
that's where we're about to start going because if you want to understand natural logarithms and

408
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,380
by extension the number e the importance that they have has everything to do with rates of change and

409
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,980
the inverse of that operation as you'll see so anyway why would it be nice to express a function

410
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,700
like this well what it's telling you let's say this was something like the size of your

411
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,980
investment this is an expression saying how much money you have at a given point in time

412
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,300
if you want to know the rate of change of that how much is it changing per unit time

413
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:02,620
it's proportional to itself and r gives you that proportionality constant if r was 0.01 it's

414
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,580
telling you that the rate of growth is 10 of the size of the thing itself so the choice that we

415
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:13,420
make to write things this way is it's basically a way to make all the constants involved more

416
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,380
readable so if you're to look at these statistics associated with bell curves and the way that we

417
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:25,420
actually tend to write things the pattern ends up looking something like 1 divided by s squared and

418
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:33,500
sometimes that x instead of writing it as x strange parentheses i might say x minus m for

419
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:41,820
some value of m both of these terms end up having really nice readable meanings where m this isn't

420
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,580
specific to the e fact but it's just a common thing you'll see m gives you the mean of the

421
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:52,220
distribution where this pile is and s gives you the standard deviation and when we choose to

422
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,660
write this family with e it's giving those constants readable meanings okay and a similar

423
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,860
thing happens with how we describe complex exponentials when we choose to write the idea

424
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,140
of walking around a circle with e it gives a very readable meaning to what this term t is it's

425
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,700
saying what is the distance that you've walked along the unit circle and you can actually

426
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:19,020
understand this with derivatives pretty well where if we say what is the derivative what is the rate

427
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:25,340
of change of some value that looks like e to the i times t by the chain rule this is going to look

428
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:32,220
like i times itself e to the i times t now what would that actually mean that means that if you're

429
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:38,700
sitting at some kind of number okay if this is your current value for e to the i times t

430
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:46,460
the rate of change is i multiplied by that value which is a 90 degree rotation of this vector

431
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:52,940
maybe i would draw it like this this right here would give you your rate of change so you might

432
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,100
move that over and consider it a velocity vector so this is kind of like your velocity vector this

433
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,820
is kind of like your position vector which i might write something like an s so what this

434
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,260
whole expression of e to the i times t is essentially saying is whatever this does if it's

435
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,900
somewhere in the complex plane at every given point the rate of change of my vector is a 90

436
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,420
degree rotation of itself and so that's why we're walking around the circle at a speed of one unit

437
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,940
per second because the length of the position vector is one so the length of the velocity

438
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,660
vector is one and it's also why if you were to look at two to the it it walks around at a

439
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:36,620
different rate because there the constant is not just i a 90 degree rotation it's i times

440
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:44,540
natural log of two i times something would mean that this where are we this operation here

441
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,540
is not just a 90 degree rotation it's a 90 degree rotation and a scaling so your velocity vector

442
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,540
would end up looking a little bit shorter and you'd be walking around the unit circle more

443
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,220
slowly so that's kind of the important thing to understand about e the fact that it's a choice

444
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,180
that we're making to write families of exponentials this way but because it is its own derivative that

445
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,180
ends up making these things play much more nicely now this lets us take derivatives of anything else

446
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,140
if you wanted if you did describe your money's rate of growth with a to the t to take its

447
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:22,460
derivative you could first do a conversion write the whole thing as e to the natural log of a

448
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:29,740
times t and the reason you would is then when we're sort of squished my font here then when

449
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:36,380
you're taking the derivative of that the derivative of the inside is the natural log of a and then

450
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:43,340
that's multiplied by itself e to the natural log of a times t which you could then spell out even

451
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:51,020
further convert it back into a to the t so if you did describe all of your investments as a to the

452
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,140
power t which kind of feels more natural to a lot of people that oh you might say rather than e to

453
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,820
some investment rate times t just think of 1.05 to the t and that describes you know something like

454
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,540
five percent growth if you were thinking of that growth in a continuous sense not you know year

455
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,020
over year what's the new percentage but moment by moment what's the rate of growth you would have to

456
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,300
say the rate of growth is the natural log of that base which just feels a little bit more awkward

457
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,220
you could do it but it would feel more awkward now all of this leaves open the question of why

458
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:31,260
why on earth is the derivative of e to the t equal to itself it's this very nice property

459
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,860
so you might wonder where this thing comes from and it really has everything to do with how you

460
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,140
how you define the number e and this can be a little bit frustrating where in some contexts

461
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,780
you'll see people say what is the number e well it's the number defined such that this derivative

462
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:54,060
equals itself and then other contexts you might find e defined in it in a different way that is

463
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,020
very conducive to whatever the circumstance there is so you might wonder okay can we come up come

464
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,540
at this a little bit more directly and try to understand derivatives of exponentials and see

465
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:12,060
why the special value 2.718 would fit into it and to do that let me draw myself a new graph here

466
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,100
let's say have some kind of exponential and if i want to understand the rate of change

467
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:31,100
okay the slope tangent to that point x the way we often think about it is think of two nearby

468
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,660
points so another one that might be x plus a little constant times h and then we're going to

469
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,220
look at the slope between those two points and consider what happens as h goes towards zero

470
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:48,460
so if this whole graph was a function a to the x if we wanted to give a very direct look at what

471
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,260
might the derivative of this expression be we can make an attempt to calculate it ourselves without

472
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,460
depending on a pre-established fact handed down from on high that e to the t is or i guess in this

473
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,420
case e to the x is its own derivative and then manipulate based on natural logs and such so what

474
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,820
does this look like if you try to come at it directly well what you would say is that the

475
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:16,060
change in the height of the graph divided by the change in the width the sort of rise over run dy dx

476
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,820
looks like the difference in the outputs at those two values so the output at the high value which

477
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:32,700
is x plus h minus the value at the low value a to the x all of that divided by the step in the x

478
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,460
direction which is just of size h and the fact that we are doing calculus here that we have

479
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,220
the little d's that is a signal to us that we don't just want this ratio for a particular value

480
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:51,180
of h we want to consider what that ratio change in y change in x looks like as the change in x goes

481
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,980
to zero and here i'm writing that change in x is h so it's a limit as h goes to zero of this

482
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:02,220
expression and from here you can try to manipulate it a little bit and see what you might find the

483
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:08,540
first step take advantage of the exponential properties to write this as a to the x times a

484
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:13,820
to the h and what's nice about that is it lets us factor out an a to the x because it shows up both

485
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:20,940
in the first term and the second so i could write this whole thing as a limit of a to the x outside

486
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:30,620
of a to the h minus one all over h and this was the limit as h goes to zero all right well x has

487
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,340
nothing to do with the h here so we're allowed to pull out the a to the x term itself as far as h

488
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,460
is concerned it's just some constant rescaling the thing and the limit of a constant times a thing is

489
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:49,180
that constant times the limit of the thing a times or a to the x times the limit as h goes to zero of

490
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:57,420
a to the h minus one over h and at this point we're a little bit stuck

491
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,940
we've found a very interesting fact which is that any kind of exponential e or whatever you want

492
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,860
based pi to the x 2 to the x 69 to the x those have derivatives that are proportional to themselves

493
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,740
but we want to understand this proportionality constant and i could ask you to guess just to

494
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,500
see if you can get a feel for it in the context of one particular example so let's say that i'm

495
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,140
choosing a base of something like two and i want to understand rates of change of two to the x

496
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,820
our question asks us the limit below i guess it tells us it tells us a little bit about what it is

497
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:38,460
the limit below is a number between zero and one so this is we're looking at two to a small value

498
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,540
minus one divided by that same small value don't worry about calculating it exactly i'm just kind

499
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,340
of curious if you guessed enter some kind of guess for what this value is and then round it

500
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,940
to two decimal places so we can have some consistency so we'll give you a moment to just

501
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,620
think of what it might be but don't think too hard if you don't want to it's it's totally

502
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:09,420
okay to get this one wrong we just want to see what people think

503
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:27,420
so

504
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,900
looks like we've got a couple things coming in from the audience here

505
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,260
which is always fun so robert points out that in french the notation reads

506
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:47,580
logarithm and is wondering why this word is used i asked this on twitter the other day evidently

507
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:55,980
it's in reference to a person i think john napier and so it's like in reference to him and then there

508
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:02,540
was a truly terrible french pun about like an exponential and a logarithm walk into a bar and

509
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:08,540
they order a beer and like who pays and the answer is that the exponential has to pay because the

510
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:15,340
logarithm which anyone who speaks french will like groan and laugh at but that made me laugh a little

511
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,780
bit um do i have a personal vendetta against e yeah yeah i do i think it's an overrated constant

512
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,860
i think it's beautiful but i think it's beautiful in ways that aren't what people think they are

513
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,020
um and i also think that i'm going to talk about this in a moment we should write we shouldn't

514
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,020
write the exponential function as e to the x because when it's more general that doesn't make

515
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,740
sense and i think it confuses people we should just write it as what it is which is a certain

516
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,220
polynomial and just be honest up front rather than letting e like e has nothing to do with e

517
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:48,780
to the pi i that's a frustrating fact it shouldn't be in there anyway um german here uh is normal for

518
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,220
how you do maths on a ruled paper instead of graph paper uh i mean graph paper is definitely nicer

519
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:59,020
but um i don't know this this was the paper that i just had on hand and in general if you want to

520
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,580
make any comments or um questions about the lesson uh you can do so on twitter with the

521
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,340
hashtag lockdown math and those will be pulled up as we go so it seems like we have strong

522
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:13,500
consensus um on our guess here which is people guessing that the correct answer to this limit

523
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:19,900
is that it's around 0.69 which i assume the reason everybody guessed that is because it's the correct

524
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,180
answer that this limit does in fact approach around 0.69 and we could play with python if we

525
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:30,460
wanted to see that experimentally python's kind of overkill here you could do it with any calculator

526
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:36,380
but if i raise two to some small power right i get some kind of number and if i subtract one from

527
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,340
that then i get a small number and if i divide it by the same small power so here i had three

528
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,140
zeros than a one it looks like we get around 0.6931 and if i made it a smaller value that i

529
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:54,940
was doing uh it seems to stay pretty stable around there it's around 0.69314 so uh congratulations to

530
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:00,300
the majority of you who had the right guess here and in fact it's no coincidence that that's what

531
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:06,540
it is because uh like i said earlier if you're taking the derivative where where have i written

532
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:12,060
it i've written it somewhere sloppily as i am want to do i've written that if you take the derivative

533
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,540
of something that looks like a to the t the constant sitting in front is the natural log of a

534
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:23,580
so for something like two you would be looking at the natural log of two which is in fact um around

535
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:29,660
0.69 now all of that was dependent on the fact that e to the x is its own derivative right

536
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,580
there's one avenue that you could take here if you want to uh come up with a definition of e

537
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:41,100
what you could say and this is totally valid is the number e is to define defined to be the

538
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,140
constant such that this limit is one if that's the case then e to the x is its own derivative

539
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:53,340
by definition pretty much and then from there you will get the fact that um anything else

540
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,860
its derivative can be expressed in terms of the log base e of of itself that's one way that you

541
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:05,420
could go um another avenue that you could take is to say that when we write e to the x this is

542
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:11,500
actually shorthand for a certain polynomial i'm partial to this because i think this is an honest

543
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,940
representation of the role that it plays more generally like when we start talking about complex

544
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:24,060
numbers it's weird to me that in high school i saw euler's formula as the polar representation for

545
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:29,260
complex numbers before it was ever really explained that e to the x does not refer to

546
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:34,220
the repeated multiplication that it's a shorthand for this long polynomial you might give it another

547
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:41,100
name like exp right and then that's something that it makes sense to plug in complex numbers to

548
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:47,340
traditionally the way that you see the series in uh high school is you might go through a calculus

549
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,620
class where you learn about e to the x being its own derivative and then maybe at the end of a

550
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:56,940
second calculus class the fact that its own it is its own derivative in conjunction with

551
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:04,460
a very wonderful topic called taylor series right so it being its own derivative and taylor series

552
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,980
um like proves that e to the x must equal this long polynomial which is absolutely the case right

553
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:18,060
if you have a function that is its own derivative and at the value zero it equals one um you uh you

554
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,300
will find that it has to equal this polynomial an alternate approach that you could take if you

555
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:28,060
wanted in setting the foundations is to say don't worry about taylor series start with this sequence

556
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:34,620
as a primitive object and then something we talked about a couple lectures ago was because of a nice

557
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:41,740
property that this function has which is basically that when you add the inputs basically this

558
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,980
polynomial behaves like an exponential and you can prove that just from the polynomial itself without

559
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:53,820
calculus or anything x of a plus b equals x of a times x of b and it's a very pleasing exercise

560
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,900
to kind of work out the expansion and see that that works and the fact that that works we talked

561
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:04,460
about this a couple lectures ago implies that the whole sequence looks like whatever x of one is

562
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,980
raised to the x so what you could say is the number e is defined to be this particular sequence

563
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,420
evaluated at x equals one and if you go that direction that's all well and good and it becomes

564
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,980
a kind of substantive thing to talk about e to the x being its own derivative and it's one of

565
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,580
the most pleasing exercises that you'll ever do because we can take a look at this and if you know

566
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:33,420
how to take derivatives of polynomial terms well let's just work it out actually i'll turn over a

567
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:39,180
new leaf so that it can be nice and cleanly seen it's really one of the most pleasing i don't know

568
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,340
times that you'll have in a calculus class if you're just sitting you're looking at this

569
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:48,540
particular infinite polynomial and you're saying i wonder what the derivative of this happens to be

570
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,620
and all you need to know is the power rule for polynomial terms and you'll say that the derivative

571
00:48:54,620 --> 00:49:03,260
let me take d dx well the derivative of a constant uh ends up being zero the derivative of x is one

572
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:12,620
so the derivative of x squared over two you know you might think of that two is kind of hopping

573
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:21,020
down in front and leaving one less than itself so it uh it becomes two times x to the one just x to

574
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:29,020
the one over two and those twos cancel so we're adding x x cubed over three factorial i might

575
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:35,340
x cubed over three times two times one this ends up being three times x squared you know the

576
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:41,500
exponential the exponent kind of hopped down and left behind one minus itself over three times two

577
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:48,780
times one the threes cancel so we can see that that's actually the same as x squared over two

578
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:54,540
factorial and in general each one of our terms as the exponent hops down it cancels out one of the

579
00:49:54,540 --> 00:50:03,180
things from the factorials below it and what we get is the exact same sequence but shifted

580
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,100
which is quite nice and like i said the uh the traditional way that you see this series

581
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,100
is that you're using the fact that e to the x is its own derivative in conjunction with Taylor

582
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,820
series to show that it must equal this but if you start with this as a primitive and you say this is

583
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:24,460
the thing that defines a special function for which we use the shorthand e to the x then it

584
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:29,980
feels a little bit more contentful and quite fun to say that e to the x ends up being its own

585
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,060
derivative and like we showed earlier that then lets you take the derivative of all sorts of other

586
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:39,980
things which in turn explains why we adopt the convention of writing all of our exponentials

587
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:46,540
as e to something times t as opposed to writing them all as a to something times t even though

588
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:53,500
those are equivalent and often weirdly hard to appreciate so with all of that said we can turn

589
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,980
ourselves back in the direction of natural logarithms because let's say i wanted to know

590
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:05,900
the derivative of the natural log you might wonder why i want to know that but if i have a bit you

591
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,940
know a deeper relationship with the natural log of x in terms not just of how it relates to these

592
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,900
series but in all facets of math maybe we can then start drawing connections and if you build up that

593
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,620
relationship by knowing things like its derivative it actually helps you come back and understand

594
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:27,100
things like the alternating series we were looking at before so can we use the fact that e to the x

595
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:38,380
is its own derivative to figure out the slope of a natural log curve well what that slope is asking

596
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:45,980
us is to look at a given input x we consider a tiny step dx to the right look at the corresponding

597
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:54,220
step dy up and we want to understand the ratio dy over dx now at this point which has some kind

598
00:51:54,220 --> 00:52:03,580
of output y what we can say is by definition y is the natural log of x now this is the same statement

599
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:09,340
as saying e have i written this right y is natural yeah great so this is the same as saying e to the

600
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:16,620
y is equal to x okay now from there i can understand the relationship between tiny nudges to x and tiny

601
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:25,020
nudges to y by taking derivatives if i ask about you know some tiny nudge to the value x and the

602
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:32,860
corresponding tiny nudge to e to the y well what it means for e to the x or in this case e to the y

603
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:38,620
to be its own derivative is that the size of that tiny nudge is e to whatever the y value at that

604
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:47,900
point is times dy and we're saying that that equals dx and what this lets us do then is express the

605
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:56,780
slope that we want dy over dx if we just rearrange things it looks like one divided by e to the y so

606
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:02,860
what this is saying is that if we look at our graph it's got some x coordinate some y coordinate

607
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,820
and i want to know what the slope is this change to y over change in x i can't immediately express

608
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:14,300
it in terms of x maybe but i do know whatever this value of y is if i take e to the power of that and

609
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,540
then reciprocate that gives me the slope but of course what it means to be on our graph is that

610
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,020
y is the natural log of x which is the same as saying e to the y equals x so this whole thing

611
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,300
is the same as taking one divided by x so if i want to know that slope i can say what is your

612
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:37,820
x coordinate take one divided by that and that gets me the slope of the natural log which is

613
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:45,260
we've just gone through a process called implicit differentiation if you're not inclined to believe

614
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:50,700
that this manipulation is legitimate that we can just move around the dx's and dy's like that i

615
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,780
have a whole video about implicit differentiation in the calculus series that you can take a look at

616
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:01,980
but the point for us is that we have a very nice fact that the derivative of ln of x looks like

617
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,540
one divided by x and that's quite nice and it kind of passes a gut check that ln of x gets

618
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,500
shallower and shallower as you go on which means the slope gets smaller and smaller

619
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,260
and the graph of one over x you know what does that look like

620
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:23,340
well at the input let's say we have the input one somewhere like here it'll be at one

621
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,980
at the input two it'll be sitting at a half at the input three it'll be sitting at a third

622
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:38,300
and in general it gets lower and lower and closer to zero okay so the idea that this would describe

623
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,300
the slope of that you know something that gets lower and lower closer to zero seems to pass

624
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,740
a little bit of a sanity check now the relevance that this is going to have to us will involve

625
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:53,340
the inverse operation to differentiation so instead of talking about what is the slope

626
00:54:53,340 --> 00:55:02,300
of the natural log curve what i might do is ask about the area under this particular curve let's

627
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:08,540
say take the area up to my stomach was just rumbling i don't know if that's audible on the

628
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:15,340
microphone clearly gotta eat lunch before these things so let's say i want to understand the area

629
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:22,620
up to n of something like this okay what that what that involves is taking the integral

630
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:31,500
between one and our value n of one divided by x by dx now this actually looks quite similar

631
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,740
in spirit the idea of adding up a bunch of things that look like one over x to what we were looking

632
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,940
at earlier how much earlier i guess over here where we're adding up one plus a half plus a third

633
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,340
plus a fourth on and on and already it gives a little bit of an intuitive instinct for why

634
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:51,100
something like this sum would be related to natural logs because we now know that in calculus

635
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,380
land natural logs are intimately related to the idea of one divided by x but i want you to think

636
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:02,460
of this spelled out a little bit more exactly and so we'll pop on over to our quiz one more time

637
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,060
second to last question for today

638
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:14,140
and the question asks us all right we're gonna let s be the sum from n equals one up to capital

639
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:20,300
n of one divided by n okay that's s and then we're going to let i be an analogous integral where

640
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:29,340
we're integrating dx over x between one and n and it asks you to compare s and i okay i'll give you

641
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:42,220
s and i okay i'll give you a moment to think about that

642
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:08,700
so interestingly we don't have a ton of consensus around this one so there's only three options and

643
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,500
we've got a nice split and as you guys know this is actually one of my favorite things when we do

644
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,300
any of these lockdown live quizzes um is when it's not you know everyone hopping on to one

645
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:24,380
particular thing but we have a division among folks and i think that's great i'm curious

646
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:32,220
i'm curious actually what the uh what the answer is going to be here and in fact even if it's not

647
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,700
been enough time to you know thoroughly think through i'm going to go ahead and grade it just

648
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,180
so that we can see what it happens to be and a lot of these the spirit of it is that you kind of

649
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,900
hazard a guess so feel no shame if you entered an answer and then it's not what turns out to be

650
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:53,580
correct so in this case um the sum does in fact end up being bigger than the integral and the

651
00:57:53,820 --> 00:58:00,780
and it looks like uh 900 of you got that correct which is awesome and then um following that was

652
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,020
people thinking that it was less and then to those in b thinking that they were identical you know

653
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,580
that's uh that's a reasonable thought because they're such similar expressions but there's a

654
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:15,420
picture that really makes the answer kind of shine out to us here which is if i look at the curve 1

655
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,460
over x which is what this white curve is it's 1 over x and then i'm going to consider a bunch of

656
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:27,180
bars each of whose area corresponds to 1 over n for some value of n so for example for the value

657
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:34,540
1 this bar has a width of 1 and then the height is 1 and that means that right above the input 1

658
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:40,140
on its upper left corner it's hitting the graph now for the next term if i want 1 over 2 that

659
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:46,380
means it's going to hit the graph above the input 2 since the graph is defined to be 1 over x so its

660
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:53,020
upper left corner hits that and then the area of this bar whose height is one half is well one half

661
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,740
because its width is 1 similarly this bar has an area of one third this bar has an area of one

662
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:04,780
fourth and so what you have is a sequence of rectangles whose total area is going to be similar

663
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,260
to the area under the curve definitely similar but you can tell that it's going to be bigger because

664
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:14,060
some of the area is leaking out in this context we've got a lot of area leaking out from the

665
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,180
first bar a little bit less leaking out from the second and on and on but as you go because the

666
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,660
graph flattens out it becomes quite a good approximation once you account for the area

667
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:29,020
that's leaked out there now something kind of bizarre is happening here where usually we think

668
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:34,060
of these rectangles as being something like a Riemann sum that defines integration where we say

669
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,380
oh we don't know what the area under a curve is but we like areas of rectangles so we use the

670
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,940
rectangles to approximate the curve here we're going to do something that's backwards to that

671
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:48,220
if we know calculus we do know the area under the curve it's very nice it involves the anti-derivative

672
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,380
of 1 over x like we'll show in a moment what we don't know is the sum of the areas of the

673
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,020
rectangles that was the sum that we were looking at earlier and trying to understand so here we're

674
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:02,220
going backwards and using the area under a curve to approximate the area of a bunch of rectangles

675
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,940
which i think is fun it shows that calculus has this back and forth it's not just geometry

676
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:12,060
informing understanding of curves but it's an understanding of curves informing an understanding

677
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:18,300
of geometry and number theory and things of that sort so what this means for us is that if we take

678
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:24,860
a look back at our paper and we look at my much more sloppily drawn graph than the beautiful exact

679
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:31,340
illustrations can give us if we want to understand that area taking this integral the task is to do

680
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:37,740
an inverse derivative to ask what function has a derivative that equals the inside here if that's

681
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,860
something you haven't learned about again calculus series take a look at the fundamental theorem of

682
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,340
calculus video or even the first video in that series i think shows a little of an instinct for

683
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:53,980
why you have this relationship between slopes and areas but what it means for us is that we take the

684
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,860
inverse derivative which we now know is the natural log the thing whose derivative is 1 over x is the

685
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:05,980
natural log and we evaluate it at the bounds at n and 1 and this notation where i kind of put

686
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:11,900
brackets around it and then a number in the upper right corner and lower right corner means i take

687
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:19,740
that expression evaluated at the top minus that expression evaluated at the bottom okay and that

688
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:30,620
well natural log of 1 what is that e to the what equals 1 well it's 0 right pretty much anything

689
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:37,500
to the 0 will equal 1 so this term goes away entirely and what we're left with is the natural

690
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:46,460
log of n and what this means for us is if we were using our rectangles to approximate the sum or

691
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:51,740
using the the integral to approximate those rectangles it's saying that 1 over 1 plus 1

692
01:01:51,740 --> 01:02:01,420
over 2 plus 1 over 3 on and on up to a given bound is about equal to the natural log of n

693
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:07,900
and more specifically if you were to account for how much area is leaking out here that area

694
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:13,260
actually does converge as n toward tends towards infinity the area that's leaked out

695
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:18,300
approaches a certain constant and it's a it's called euler's constant or the euler

696
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:26,620
macheroni constant and it happens to be around 0.577 so in the same way that pi and e are

697
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:32,540
constants of nature this is another constant of nature also bearing euler's name and what it

698
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:39,420
what it describes is the deviation between this sum often called the harmonic sum and the natural

699
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:45,580
log of x a thing that is related to e so euler has really got his fingerprints all over the situation

700
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:50,380
at least as far as naming is concerned in our little expression here so that's quite nice that's

701
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:55,260
quite fun but that only answers one of the mysteries that we had earlier because if you'll

702
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:00,300
remember i opened this whole thing up by talking not just about this series that grows like the

703
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:06,540
natural log we also alternated it we went 1 minus a half plus a third minus a fourth and the claim

704
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:12,300
is that that was the natural log of 2 so let's see if we can try to understand why that's true and

705
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:18,620
i might i might actually postpone explaining the even more bizarre fact that this interrelates

706
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:23,100
with primes in a certain way depending on how long i want this particular stream to go but

707
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,620
let's at least finish off by understanding the alternating series because it's extremely

708
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:31,660
satisfying so to do that let me just rewrite what our series looks like

709
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:40,380
and this is one of those things where as i go through the answer it has a feeling of

710
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:47,340
magic and sometimes not in a great way you might find yourself looking at how we go about this

711
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:53,980
and asking how on earth would anyone ever come up with that and maybe after we plop it all down we

712
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:58,300
can try to introspect and think about the reasonable ways that someone would come up

713
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:04,140
with the following line of reasoning but it it is not unique to this situation it's kind of a useful

714
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:09,180
set of tricks to be familiar with and there's a couple general principles in there the first

715
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,420
general principle is that if we have a hard question in this case figuring out what this

716
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:19,340
sum approaches bizarrely it can become easier if we make it more general you might think that

717
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:25,980
making things more general would make it harder because you have to answer a more powerful fact

718
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,940
but math does this bizarre thing where sometimes by trying to make it more general

719
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:38,220
you actually make the problem more tractable which is quite cool actually because what it means is

720
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,300
when a mathematician is motivated only by making their own life easier it has the strange effect of

721
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:52,540
making their results applicable to a wider variety of circumstances so the way i'm going to

722
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:56,940
generalize this again it might look kind of bizarre and unmotivated but run with me for a second

723
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:03,420
is rather than thinking of a single value i'm going to put an x in here and consider this a

724
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:10,780
function where i'm taking x over 1 minus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 3 on and on and on

725
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:16,620
and i want to know in general what does this approach for various values of x and then i just

726
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,900
have to plug in the value x equals 1 and like i said that might make it seem harder infinitely

727
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,420
harder previously we just had to know one value now you're asking me to compute infinitely many

728
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:31,660
values but if you know calculus you might recognize that the exponents of your polynomial

729
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:37,420
terms might just play nicely with the denominators here and in particular if we were to take the

730
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:44,460
derivative of this series it behaves quite nicely the derivative of x is 1 the derivative of x

731
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:49,500
squared over 2 well that 2 hops down and cancels out the denominator so it becomes negative x

732
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:56,140
similarly that 3 hops down and cancels the denominator so it becomes x squared and while

733
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:01,340
you might not know why we're taking a derivative of something here and how that would be helpful

734
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:08,540
for actually evaluating the uh the ultimate sum that we care about it is an interesting fact and

735
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:15,820
it's something that is playful and fun that we've somehow simplified the expression by taking its

736
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:22,540
derivative and the simplification is actually quite important because uh there's a um a well

737
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:28,460
known fact within math that you can take a series where each term is the product of the last with a

738
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:33,980
constant kind of product so here as we go from one term to the next we're always multiplying by

739
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:39,980
negative x so to go from negative x to x squared you multiply by negative x and then similarly x

740
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:46,940
squared to negative x cubed you're multiplying by negative x and when that's the case the series as

741
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:52,300
a whole is going to approach 1 divided by or wherever you start but here we started at 1 so

742
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:57,900
the thing you started at divided by 1 minus the thing that you're constantly multiplying by which

743
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:05,660
is negative x so to give another example of what where this comes up is if we were to take something

744
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:13,100
like 1 plus one half plus one fourth where each time in our sequence we are multiplying the last

745
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:22,220
term by one half this will equal 1 divided by 1 minus the thing we were multiplying by which was

746
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:28,620
one half and 1 divided by 1 minus a half ends up being the same as 2 and that actually kind of

747
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:33,180
feels intuitive that if we take 1 plus a half plus a fourth plus an eighth you could even draw out a

748
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:43,820
picture where let's say I've got a rectangle whose side length is 1 and 1 here I can say the 1

749
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:49,820
represents this area and then half represents this area and then a fourth represents this area

750
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:54,860
then an eighth represents that area and kind of keep playing this game and eventually it'll fill

751
01:07:54,860 --> 01:08:00,940
an area of two now the more general version of that is this geometric sum which someone who's

752
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,100
done a lot of problem solving in math is able to recognize kind of quickly which is why they might

753
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:12,060
enjoy this series much more than they would enjoy the one above it so this whole thing ends up

754
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:19,740
looking like 1 divided by 1 plus x great but what this suggests is that if we somehow take an

755
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:26,380
anti-derivative if we somehow integrate this we might have an alternate expression for what the

756
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:34,780
the initial sequence was okay so from here I'm going to go ahead and pose a quiz and part of this

757
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:41,580
quiz is seeing who in the audience is comfortable with calculus and again if you're not calculus

758
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:49,260
series go and check it out but what we have here is the question what is the integral from 0 up to

759
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:57,820
1 of 1 divided by 1 plus x dx okay I want you to evaluate that integral and I'll give you a little

760
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,660
moment for this one

761
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:21,660
so

762
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:31,740
so

763
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:44,220
and you know tell you what while answers are rolling in before locking it in I'm going to go

764
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:52,300
ahead and just start describing the answer here so if you want to know the integral from 0 up to 1

765
01:09:53,500 --> 01:10:01,260
of 1 divided by 1 plus x dx well we know that the anti-derivative of 1 over x is the natural log of x

766
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:09,500
so it's going to be the natural log of that inside divided by the derivative of the inside that's

767
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,580
kind of the inverse chain rule or something you can get with u substitution but the derivative

768
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:18,060
of the inside is just 1 so you can check yourself that if you take the derivative of this you get 1

769
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:22,940
over the inside 1 over 1 plus x but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1 so it stays the

770
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:31,580
same so then we evaluate this at the bounds 1 and 0 and what this ends up getting us is the natural

771
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:39,100
log at the top which is 1 plus 1 minus the natural log of 1 plus x at the bottom which was 1 plus 0

772
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:45,500
the natural log of 1 plus 1 is of course ln of 2 and then we're subtracting off the natural log of

773
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:54,940
1 which is 0 so the proper answer here comes out to be the natural log of 2 and it looks like 1600

774
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:00,860
of you have correctly answered that so well done well done indeed and if you wanted to kind of

775
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,660
visualize this in your head or get some sort of like gut instinct on which of those answers seemed

776
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:13,100
loosely correct even if you didn't know how to calculate it immediately the graph of 1 over 1

777
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:18,380
plus x is going to look just like the graph of 1 over x but shifted to the left so it's actually

778
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:26,060
going to pass through the input 0 1 and then we're looking for the area under here so you know that

779
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:30,540
it's going to be an area somewhere between 0 and 1 probably filling up more than a half of it and

780
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:37,980
the natural log of 2 is around 0.69 so that that actually seems about right but what's quite cool

781
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:47,820
here is that if we say that the well I can just I guess write it out again here if I say I want to

782
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:55,740
integrate this bottom expression from 0 up to 1 okay which is the same as integrating

783
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:04,700
1 over 1 plus x from 0 up to 1 I know that that should be the value 2 ln of 2

784
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:12,300
okay but on the other hand if I picture taking my anti-derivative and getting this whole sequence

785
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:20,540
here and evaluating it between 0 and 1 what I'm doing is I'm plugging in the number 1 which gets

786
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:25,020
me my alternating sequence then I'm subtracting off the value of 0 which when I plug it in just

787
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:31,340
gets 0 so evaluating this at 0 and 1 is the same thing as integrating the bottom expression from

788
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:36,380
0 to 1 which is the same thing as integrating 1 over 1 plus x from 0 to 1 which is the same thing

789
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:42,460
as natural log of 2 and hence that whole top thing ends up being the natural log of 2 very clever just

790
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:47,980
such a sneaky sequence of manipulations that like I said if you just see it plopped down almost as

791
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:52,620
intimidating because you wonder how on earth do you go from seeing this sequence up here to

792
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:57,500
thinking about ah yes if I generalize it with lots of powers of x and then take the derivatives

793
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,660
of those and then use a geometric series sum and then integrate that using natural log yes then

794
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,980
it'll all become obvious and I think the answer is that that's probably not what the problem solving

795
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:10,380
process looks like instead you build up a familiarity with a lot of these things like

796
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,860
derivatives of polynomial terms and then you build up familiarity with other things like derivatives

797
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:19,180
of natural logs and the more familiarity you have with a lot of different pieces of math then

798
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:23,100
sometimes when you see one particular pattern you're able to draw in your mind a connection

799
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:28,060
to things that make you look like a genius I think Euler did this all the time if you look at some of

800
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:33,100
the great discoveries of Euler they just come really out of nowhere I mean the very opening

801
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:39,580
thing that I talked about I guess it wasn't the very opening but early on where are we

802
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:49,420
I seem to have the the sum of the reciprocals of squares which somewhere in my notebook here

803
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:55,500
we were just looking at the pages maybe I tore it out oh yeah no there we are

804
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,300
things can become a little bit of a mess over here but if we look at this uh this long somewhere

805
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:06,220
we're taking one over one squared one over two squared and equals pi squared over six the way

806
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:12,060
that Euler found this um I mean it involves this very strange thing where you start looking at an

807
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:19,180
infinite product associated with sine of pi times x and if you think of it as starting with this sum

808
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:23,820
and then dreaming up out of your head an infinite product associated with sine of pi times x or

809
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:27,660
it might have been cotangent of pi times x or something like that it really does seem like it

810
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:32,140
came out of nowhere but in general I think you build up these bits of familiarity with different

811
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:37,100
pieces and then once you see something like Euler seeing that basel problem sum or someone seeing

812
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:42,300
this alternating harmonic sum you're able to use those connections to kind of make yourself look

813
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,500
smarter than you actually are which is fun and if nothing else it helps motivate the idea of just

814
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,980
being playful with your calculus and being playful with your math purely for the motivation of

815
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,740
exposing yourself to more patterns and more
