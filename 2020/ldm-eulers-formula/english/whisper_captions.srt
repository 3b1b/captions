00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to Lockdown Math! Today we are going to be talking about Euler's formula.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,300
And just to give you a little sense of where we're going to be ending up with this lesson,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm going to go ahead and show you what we're aiming for at the end, which is a certain visualization.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,960
So, I don't expect you to necessarily understand this immediately,

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,400
but the point is that this is something we're going to walk towards.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,040
What we're going to analyze is an extension of the idea of exponentials in a way that works in the complex plane.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,260
And the illustration that you're looking at is showing very literally what the claim of Euler's formula is.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,800
Because what I want you to appreciate is what the actual statement says,

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,900
rather than letting it be shrouded in a certain mystery or a certain question of what the conventions are.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,660
Now, needless to say, this is kind of a confusing thing. We've got this spiral of vectors, and if it's not entirely clear, don't worry about it.

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,560
I just want to give you a little sense of where we're going to be going with this.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,160
But before any of that, let's take a step back and remember where were we.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,900
Back in the end of the last lesson, when we were talking about complex numbers,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,140
one of the key types of complex numbers that we were looking at were those that existed on the unit circle.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,220
So here I have a little complex plane drawn. We've got the real number line with the points 1 and negative 1 indicated.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,200
We've got the imaginary number line, i being the square root of negative 1.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:27,300
And if you remember, one of the main points that we emphasized last time is that when you have a number who's sitting one unit away from the origin at some angle theta,

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,060
multiplying by this number has the effect of rotating things by that angle.

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,320
This is incredibly important throughout physics, throughout electrical engineering, all throughout math.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,900
You see these numbers everywhere. They describe wave mechanics, they're very important for polynomials.

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,000
It's really hard to overstate how important numbers that sit on this unit circle are.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,220
Now one way that you could write them is with the real and imaginary parts.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,960
And based on lecture 2, if we know our trigonometry, the x coordinate is going to be the cosine of that angle,

24
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,900
and the y coordinate, which is the imaginary part, is going to be i times the sine of that angle.

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,840
So you might think, all throughout physics, all throughout electrical engineering, you see the expression cosine of theta plus i sine of theta.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,580
In fact, what you often see is another form of this.

27
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,620
Almost always, you see this written down as e to the power i times theta.

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,620
And this relationship is what's known as Euler's formula.

29
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,640
Now e is a special constant of nature, and I always remember in high school, it was never crystal clear to me exactly what it was.

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,660
It was something that was just kind of handed down, okay, it's 2.71828, on and on.

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,260
And we were just taking, you know, we were to take this as an analog of pi.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,620
It's an irrational number that evidently the universe finds significant.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,580
I had one calculus teacher who would tell us it was the Andrew Jackson number, because the president, Andrew Jackson, served two terms.

34
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,880
He was the seventh president, and he was elected in 1828.

35
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,520
So, there you go.

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't know if Andrew Jackson appreciated this relationship that he had to Euler, but it always helped me remember the number.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,480
Now, just to gauge sentiment, because I'm not entirely sure where the audience is, I want to know what your current relationship with this particular formula is.

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,520
So we're going to do a poll to start, and this poll is mostly going to be helpful to me.

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:28,060
So, polling up some of the warm-up questions that we had, where evidently most of you, if you were to choose one of Euler's formulas, would have gone with the one that we're talking about today, which is great, you know, appropriate given where we want to head.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:42,340
As a poll that's actually going to be helpful to me, let me ask you, which of the following best describes your relationship with the formula e to the power i theta equals cosine of theta plus i times the sine of theta?

41
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:42,840
Okay?

42
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:55,040
And the options here are that you've never seen it before, totally understandable, that you've seen it but you're confused by it, that you still don't understand it but you've grown used to it, or that you understand it well.

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:08,040
So, as you can see, answers are rolling in. Please participate! This is going to be way fun if more of you participate. You can go to 3b1b.co slash live, link is also in the description, that forwards you to the place where you can answer this poll.

44
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:19,800
And while answers are rolling in, I just want to remind us of a more famous variant of this expression that you often see, which is basically what happens when you plug in pi.

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:38,580
So, if we say e to the i times pi, now we're thinking of pi as an angle, it's a number of radians, a distance around the unit circle, you would plug in cosine of pi plus i times the sine of pi.

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,620
Okay? And the way to think about that is to look at the unit circle and ask, what if you walked around until you'd walked a total distance of pi?

47
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:57,160
You know, if it's a lake with a radius 1 and you walk around the boundary until you've gone a distance of pi, kind of by the definition of what pi is, that takes you halfway around the circle.

48
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:06,980
So the x component, cosine, is going to be negative 1, and then the y component, sine, is actually 0, so there's no imaginary part, it's just negative 1.

49
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:15,080
And this gets us, you know, what might be the most celebrity equation in all of math, e to the i times pi is equal to negative 1.

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:25,700
Okay? But it's baffling, genuinely baffling, because you've got this idea of raising a constant, which is a little wishy-washy to start with, what is e, but you're raising it to an imaginary power.

51
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,220
And if you don't understand what that means, you're in good company, I think very few people in the world actually do.

52
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:41,560
Now turning back to our poll, where we've got a good number of responses, and a pretty good spread too, I'm genuinely curious to know, who am I talking to right now?

53
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,860
Okay? Because it looks like we have a pretty even distribution among all camps.

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,620
Alright, so the number one most common answer is c, which is those who still don't understand it but they've grown used to it.

55
00:05:51,620 --> 00:06:02,800
This, I'm going to guess, includes people like math majors or engineering majors or people who have gone into a technical field, where it comes up a lot, so you have to grow used to it.

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:16,920
This is also revealing the fact that even though these lectures are targeted at high school students, that this channel has a certain base demographic to start with, so sometimes those sitting in the audience, it's more like adults who have walked in and are sitting in the back of the class.

57
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,260
Very happy to see that d, I understand it well, is the second most common answer.

58
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:32,400
I'm curious among those who answer d, if by the end of the lecture they would say that what they understood about this is the same as what I'm going to teach.

59
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,860
Because for example, I would make the claim that this formula actually has nothing to do with the number e, okay?

60
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,400
That the number e doesn't actually play a role in what this formula is computationally saying.

61
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,400
And I'd be curious if those who claim that they understand it well would agree with that statement.

62
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,300
After that we have those who've seen it but are confused by it, and at the very end is the actual target demographic of those who've never seen it before.

63
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:04,260
Oh, I don't know if it's fair to call that the target demographic because I think sometimes you see it in an odd circumstance here or there, but definitely those who answered a or b, you're my people.

64
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,660
You're the ones that I want to talk to about this, okay?

65
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,640
But let's say you see this, okay? You see this weird formula e to the pi i, or the generalization e to the i times some angle.

66
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:24,580
I think the healthy reaction to have to this, okay, if you're just seeing this for the first time, the healthy question to ask is w t f, okay?

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,400
What is the function at play and how is it defined, okay?

68
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,940
What's the function? Because in this case the function is e to the x, and we're plugging in certain imaginary inputs.

69
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:51,680
And I think a lot of people think that that refers to taking a number e and multiplying by itself some number of times, and that x describes how often you're multiplying by itself.

70
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:01,400
And that yeah, there's some notion of extending that to things like one half or negative one, or any kind of real number, but that it's based in this idea of repeated multiplication.

71
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:11,020
Now the thing that makes this equation misleading is that that's not the function. That is not what e to the x is referring to. Let's emphasize that very heavily.

72
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,820
This is not what e to the x means. This is not its convention.

73
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:23,060
Instead, what has emerged in math is that we use e to the x to be a shorthand for another function.

74
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,820
A function which I'm going to give the name exp. This is how you often see it in literature.

75
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:45,000
And it's defined to be a certain polynomial. It's one plus x plus x squared divided by two plus x cubed divided by six plus x to the power four divided by twenty four.

76
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,260
And in fact it's not a polynomial, it's an infinite polynomial. We add infinitely many terms, each of which look like x to the n divided by n factorial.

77
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:07,160
The proper term for this is a series. In practice, if you're actually computing this, because that denominator grows so quickly, you can chop off the series pretty early to get an approximate value for what this actually is.

78
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:25,920
Now right away, we can see that this is going to work for lots of kinds of x that we could plug in. Anything where we know how to raise x to a power, just a whole number power, multiply it by itself, and where we know how to divide by a factorial and add those together, we can come up with a nice meaning for what this exp function means.

79
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:36,560
But before we jump into things like complex numbers and throwing that in, I think it would be very unsatisfying to do that if we didn't first draw the connection to the number e.

80
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:47,280
And the idea of repeated multiplication. Because on the surface, this infinite polynomial seems very different from the idea of some special constant of nature e and raising it to a power.

81
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:58,460
So let's build up a little familiarity. We're going to take, you know, a couple minutes to do this. And it's a very healthy exercise I think to become friends with this function by starting to plug in a couple different values.

82
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:09,920
One of the first you might plug in is the number 1. So that way we get 1 and then x is 1, so that's 1. x squared is still 1, so that's 1 half.

83
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:20,640
And then 1 sixth. And then 1 twenty fourth. And in general, we're adding 1 divided by n factorial.

84
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:31,380
In math we say that this is a series that converges in the sense that as we add more and more terms, it approaches a certain value and it gets closer and closer to some specific value.

85
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,360
And that value ends up being around 2.71828, the Andrew Jackson number.

86
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,180
But at this point, just think of it as it was going to be something. x of 1 was going to be something. This is what x of 1 happens to be.

87
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,280
At the moment, there isn't necessarily anything special about that. But let's say you wanted to plug in other values.

88
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:06,700
Just to get a little practice with what that would look like, if I wanted x of 2, it would look like 1 plus 2 plus 2 squared over 2 plus 2 cubed over 6.

89
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:15,380
And in principle, if you were on a desert island and you just needed to compute x of 2, you could work this all out by hand if you were comfortable with long division.

90
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:28,820
But of course, we live in the modern world. We have computers, we have programming. So I think to make this especially concrete, let's go ahead and actually implement this function so that we can calculate a couple values and so that it's not a black box.

91
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,660
It's not just a calculator that's been handed to us. We implement it so we know exactly what it's doing.

92
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,180
So for that, let's go ahead and pull up a little Python. This is Desmos. We might look at that a little bit later. Right now, let's be a little bit more programmatic.

93
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,240
Let's pull up some Python. Let's import some math because that's a sign you're always going to have some fun.

94
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,980
Then I'm going to define the exp function that's going to take in some number x.

95
00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:05,640
And what I want is to return something that looks like 1 plus x plus x squared over 2, where in Python this double, what do you call it, an asterisk, this double asterisk sign is how we do exponentiation.

96
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,160
And then x cubed over 6. And we kind of want to add that up a whole bunch.

97
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:21,060
Of course, instead of typing all that out, we can use a little special syntax where I'm going to say, I want you to return a sum of a bunch of terms.

98
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,940
Each term is going to look like raising x to some power, and it knows what x is because that's what was handed to it.

99
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,700
x to some power divided by the factorial. Factorial of n. And that's built into this math package that we imported.

100
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,440
And I'm just going to do this for values of n that start at 0. 0 factorial is defined to be 1, if you're curious.

101
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,520
We could talk all about factorials of weird values at a later date, but that's all you need to know here.

102
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,360
And I'm just going to have it range up to 100 because 100 factorial is going to be huge.

103
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,400
So that's going to be plenty big enough for a denominator to be small enough that those later terms don't contribute a lot.

104
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:08,960
So even if you don't know Python, I hope that this is a reasonably clear way to turn the math into something that our computer can chew on,

105
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,480
and crunch through the numbers so that we don't have to.

106
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,080
So for example, if we type x of 1, we get the Andrew Jackson number. 2.71828, on and on.

107
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:27,000
And I could type in x of 2, and it looks like that's around 7.389. So maybe we even write that in our notes.

108
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,920
We go over here and say, interesting, x of 2 was about 7.389.

109
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:45,820
Okay. And if you spend a long time just kind of playing around with this, okay, I think it's not obvious that you might find this,

110
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:54,000
but if you were just plugging in a couple values, x of 3, x of 4, one important fact you might stumble across

111
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,020
is that if I add two numbers in the input, okay, so in this case I get 1096 when I plug in 7, which is 3 plus 4,

112
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,620
that actually ends up being the same as if I plug in x of 3 times x of 4.

113
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,740
Okay. So adding the input corresponds to multiplying in the output.

114
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:24,560
And 3 and 4 weren't special here, I could have done, you know, 5.5 and 3.2, and that would have gotten me some value.

115
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,240
And if instead I had added those together, okay, it gets the same value.

116
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:37,960
That is not at all obvious, okay? So I think that would be a genuine discovery to have with respect to this function, with this polynomial,

117
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,820
if that was something that you found. And it's important enough that I want to write it down.

118
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:56,380
Exp of a plus b is actually the same thing as exp of a times exp of b.

119
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,060
Now if you just look at the polynomial, this is not clear.

120
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,060
This is not something that, like, you look at it and say, oh yes, of course, it couldn't have been any other way.

121
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,740
At the end of today's lesson though, I'm going to give you guys some homework, and yes, homework will make you learn better.

122
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,000
And what we're going to do is go through a couple problems that are going to have you show that this fact is true.

123
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,520
That simply from the polynomial, and the fact that it includes these factorial terms, excuse me,

124
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,440
that's going to be enough to show this very special property.

125
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,920
Now why am I calling it a very special property?

126
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,420
Well, I want to ask you a certain question that will hopefully make this clear.

127
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,100
And it really is important that you think this through yourself.

128
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:45,900
Because I think if we, uh, if I just kind of tell you the implications here, it's not going to sink in to the same extent as if you really noodle with it yourself.

129
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,560
So I'm going to pull up another question, and I'm going to give you some time to think on this one.

130
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:59,340
What the question asks us is to suppose that we have some function f of x that has this special property.

131
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:07,160
We're adding two numbers in the input, f of a plus b, gives the same result as multiplying in the output, f of a times f of b.

132
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,040
And that this is true for any real number, a and b.

133
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,420
Okay? Suppose you have some function that satisfies this property, who cares how it's defined?

134
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,700
Whether it's through this polynomial, through other means.

135
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,800
Which of the following is true?

136
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,960
One of the options is that f of five is equal to f of one raised to the power five.

137
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,780
Another is that f of one half is equal to the square root of f of one.

138
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,760
And the other is f of negative one equals one divided by f of one.

139
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,560
Now very important, I'm not asking does there exist some function f where these three things will be true.

140
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm asking which of these necessarily has to be true only from that property.

141
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,880
So you shouldn't be able to contrive some sort of adversarial function that doesn't satisfy it.

142
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,180
And then you have various options for which collection of these three things is true.

143
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,760
I'm going to give you some time to think about this because I really do think it's important.

144
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,820
So I'm going to turn up our pause and ponder music to get us in the mood.

145
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,700
And take a desperately needed drink of water.

146
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,280
While you're noodling on that, I'm going to go ahead and take a question from the audience.

147
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,460
Where it looks like Serft asks, what do you think is more interesting to someone who is a newcomer to higher level math?

148
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,420
Special case theorems like e to the i pi or more general cases like e to the i x.

149
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,880
Oh that is such a great question. By the way, anyone who wants to ask questions go to Twitter and just use the hashtag lockdown math.

150
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,300
Those will be forwarded to me.

151
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:58,100
I think the best way to learn is to have specific examples and really let yourself understand the patterns represented by those specific examples and then generalize them.

152
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:08,340
For the specific one that you have here, I think if you just see e to the i pi, that doesn't really count as a good specific example that explains the generality.

153
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,680
It's more that you're plugging in one particular number into a formula.

154
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:22,940
So in this case e to the i x, as you'll see, it has everything to do with circular motion and between this lecture and the next one, we're going to talk about why that relation might be there.

155
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,100
So the form of having specific examples that aids your understanding wouldn't be, you know, a number like e to the i pi.

156
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:40,380
It would be building a relationship with circular motions and other circumstances like studying physics where you have a tetherball with some kind of centripetal force and it's orbiting or like orbital mechanics.

157
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:48,840
Anything where you're really understanding the nature of circular motion, that actually prepares you for understanding e to the i x as a generality a little bit better.

158
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,740
So with all of that, answers are still rolling in and I don't want you to feel rushed.

159
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,340
So I'm going to give a little bit more time here actually.

160
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:13,540
Because remember, you need to really be sure that if you're saying that something like 2 or 3 or 1 is included in your answer that any function with this special property necessarily follows that.

161
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,880
Oh, let's see if we can grade it when the top answer is the year.

162
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:31,340
So 2017, that's a little bit in the past. 2013, we're losing the top answer. Interesting, people are changing their mind. It's like we're going back in time.

163
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,440
So it looks like a couple people are, oh now we're in the future, 2023.

164
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, so we're actually seeing people think about it and thinking, hang on, you know, is it the case that option 3 here is necessarily true?

165
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,200
And they're really being critical about that. So that's a good sign.

166
00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:02,180
If you want to keep thinking about it, please do. But for the sake of continuing with the lesson, I'm going to go ahead and lock things in here and see how people ended up answering.

167
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,080
So it looks like 2030 of you, the decade in the future, believe that all three of these are necessarily true.

168
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,240
So, second most common answer was B, they only believe that the first one is true.

169
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:21,560
And then after that, people who either included number 2 or number 3. And the correct answer is that all of them are.

170
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,940
And it's very interesting to walk through why. I do think it's very elucidating. So let's go ahead and do this.

171
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:41,940
The first one, which it seems like a majority of you believe, is that if we plug in something like 5 to a function with this special property, that it'll be the same as taking f of 1 raised to the fifth.

172
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:50,180
Now the reason is that we could also write 5 as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

173
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:01,780
And this property of addition in the input becoming multiplication in the output means that's the same thing as writing x of 1 multiplied by itself 5 times.

174
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,980
Okay? It lets you rewrite the whole thing in terms of x of 1, which I'm going to say 5 times.

175
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:24,340
This is the same as taking x of 1 raised to the power 5. And here when I'm writing exponentials, anytime you see a natural number or a whole number, it can literally mean multiplying by itself that number of times.

176
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:32,460
That's not the same as the fact that e to the x is a shorthand for this crazy polynomial. So that can sometimes get a little confusing, the exponent is playing two different roles.

177
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:41,160
And we might give x of 1 a special name, a shorthand. Let's just call it e for short. That's not why we call this number e, by the way.

178
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:52,080
It's also not because this is what Euler's name starts with. It's just because whenever Euler was using this, the first time in a particular book, he was partial to vowels and the vowel a had already been used.

179
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,800
So e was just his arbitrary letter.

180
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,020
Okay, so simply by virtue of this property, we can see that x of 5 has to be written in terms of x of 1.

181
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,380
Now a little bit trickier was the question about plugging in 1 half. Okay?

182
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:13,320
And the key to solving this, it's a little bit tricky, is to think about what happens when we multiply that by itself.

183
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:24,780
x of 1 half times x of 1 half, because of this property, has to satisfy, or I should say has to equal, x of 1 half plus x of 1 half.

184
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,080
Which is of course x of 1, which let's say we're using the shorthand and we call it e.

185
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,940
So what does that mean? x of 1 half has to be a number such that multiplying it by itself equals e.

186
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,940
Well that's what we mean when we write square roots. Okay?

187
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,200
And the last one was talking about negative inputs. So just as an example, if we inputted something like negative 1.

188
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:57,460
So the key here is to ask about multiplying it by the value when you plug in 1.

189
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:07,380
By this rule, that addition in the input turns into multiplication in the output, that has to be the same as exp of 0.

190
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,340
Now what is exp of 0? Ooh, you know what I'm realizing. Hmm.

191
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,540
I think I might have actually made the, entered a wrong answer there.

192
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Because in our case, in our case exp of 0 actually does come out to be the number 1.

193
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Okay, so if we plug in 0 for x, then all of these, you add them together, the only term that matters is 1.

194
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,080
So exp of negative 1 times exp of 1 is equal to exp of 0, which is 1.

195
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:46,380
So this is true in the case of exp. I, I can't actually think to myself right now if that's necessarily true.

196
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,380
You know, if we look at our question, where it's saying all we know about f is that f of a plus b is f of a times f of b.

197
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,580
If that necessarily implies that f of 0 is going to be 1.

198
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,180
And I, I don't think it does. I think we could construct a function. Yeah, because we could just scale e to the x by some other amount.

199
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,920
Okay, yeah, so actually what's graded here is not entirely correct. The correct answer would be only 1 and 2.

200
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,420
I think. Someone correct me on Twitter if I'm wrong about that. But, very interesting.

201
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,540
So if we go back to our paper, let's see. In the case of exp, this, this value at 0 would be 1. What does that imply?

202
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,540
Well, if we call exp of 1 e, that means we're asking what is the number which when you multiply by e equals 1.

203
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:43,360
And it would be 1 divided by e. But yeah, for the general case, we need the added condition that when you plug in 0 you do get 1.

204
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,700
Now the point of all of this, right, the reason that I'm saying this, is to emphasize why it's reasonable that we use the shorthand.

205
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,020
That when we say exp of x, for real numbers x, why it would be very reasonable to write this as e to the power x.

206
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:10,600
Because basically this special property means that because you can use the number 1 to access pretty much all the real numbers by adding it to itself or dividing as needed or negating.

207
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,860
And then if you have certain continuity restrictions that will let you extend from rational numbers to all the reals.

208
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,500
But that's a technical point, you don't need to fuss over for what we're doing right now.

209
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,620
It lets you basically express everything that this polynomial can output in terms of what it outputs at the number 1.

210
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:37,660
So you might read e to the x as just, whatever this polynomial is at the input 1, we can start exponentiating in terms of that.

211
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:45,300
So that's the connection, right, we could, we could if we wanted define the number e to simply be where is this polynomial at the number 1.

212
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,160
And then all of this would follow.

213
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,860
But I really want to emphasize that only makes sense for real numbers.

214
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,720
Because as soon as we start introducing things like complex numbers, you can't just add 1 to itself or subtract and divide and get the number i.

215
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,160
And in math you often do even crazier things where you plug in things like matrices into this polynomial.

216
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,140
Which seems weird, but you know, you can take a matrix and square it, you can divide it by 2, you can add all of those together.

217
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,240
And that's actually a very useful thing.

218
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,080
It's very useful for a field called differential equations, which in turn is useful for physics.

219
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:25,140
In quantum mechanics you often plug in these things called operators, which are kind of like the mature older brother of matrices.

220
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,980
And all of that looks totally nonsensical if we're talking about a constant raised to some kind of power.

221
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,440
But what you have to understand is that it's being plugged into this polynomial.

222
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,600
So I understand why we have the convention of writing this as e to the x.

223
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,380
It makes sense for real numbers.

224
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,240
But I think that's actually a bad convention as soon as we start extending it.

225
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,380
And I think that causes a lot of undue confusion.

226
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,180
So with all of that said, let's finally have some fun and plug in some complex values.

227
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,860
And before we do that, just as kind of a warm up, I want to make sure that we're comfortable with powers of i.

228
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,720
Because that's what's going to be important here.

229
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,640
So let's pull up our quiz and let's go ahead and ask one more question.

230
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,940
And then I'll take a question from the audience too while you guys think about this.

231
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,720
Remember that i is defined to be a value that satisfies i squared equals negative one.

232
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,220
So that's defined.

233
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,020
For which values of n does i to the power n equal negative i?

234
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,580
So the spirit of this question is to have people thinking deeply about powers of i.

235
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,020
And I wanted it to be a question that's not totally obvious.

236
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,200
So one that you do have to put a little mental energy into.

237
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,620
So let's go ahead and take a question from the audience while I take a drink of water.

238
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,060
F of x equals zero doesn't work with f of negative one equals one over f of one.

239
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah, f of x equals zero.

240
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,120
Oh, interesting. Yeah, okay.

241
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,500
So they're saying that if f of x ever outputs zero.

242
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,220
Actually, I'm not entirely sure what Sam is saying.

243
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,380
F of x equals zero doesn't work with f of negative one equals one over f of one.

244
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,840
So I guess that fact that f of negative one is one over f of one doesn't imply that the output will ever be zero.

245
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,720
So I could ask for some clarification, but I think that might be getting at the general point of the mistake of the question.

246
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,340
Which was to assume, to extend the idea of exp a little bit too much.

247
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,940
Where the fact that exp of zero equals one gives us this other property.

248
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,440
And then Crispin Simmons says three is included because f of x plus zero.

249
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,540
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Great. Great.

250
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:55,020
Yeah, someone thought this through a little bit more deeply than I can while live and on camera and under some pressure.

251
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,840
F of x plus zero is the same as f of x times f of zero, which implies f of x equals one.

252
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,820
Awesome. Crispin, you saved me. You saved me on this one.

253
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,000
That's a beautiful way of thinking about it.

254
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,180
Yeah, all of these questions where you have like a property of a function and you're supposed to deduce facts.

255
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,540
They can be very subtle.

256
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
And so in this case, okay, the question was graded correctly.

257
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:27,200
The property simply that addition in the input becomes multiplication in the output is enough to imply f of zero equals one, which in turn locks in the value for f of negative one.

258
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,180
Oh, it's so pleasing.

259
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:35,600
One little property can just lock in basic, not the whole real number line because it didn't assume continuity, but it locks in pretty much any value you want.

260
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,560
Awesome. Excellent questions.

261
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,040
I love live stuff. Even if I make errors, it does feel a little more interactive than the usual videos.

262
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,140
So let's see how we're doing on the quiz.

263
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,740
Looks like we've still got some answers rolling in.

264
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,400
We're trying to understand which powers of i are equal to negative i.

265
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,660
And the options include multiples of three or multiples of three as long as they're positive,

266
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,720
or integers one below a multiple of four or those where you're restricted to them just being positive.

267
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,740
And I'm going to go ahead and grade this question.

268
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,600
And as always, if you feel like you weren't done by the time I'm locking it in,

269
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,740
know that that's just for the sake of letting the lesson progress forward.

270
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:26,380
If you wanted to pause and think about it further yourself, especially if you're watching this later, that would be totally in the spirit of these lessons.

271
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,520
Okay.

272
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:36,540
So the majority, or the plurality, I guess, of you answered that it's all integers one below a multiple of four, which is correct.

273
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,080
And the second most common answer was basically the same but restricted to positives.

274
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,600
Great.

275
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,740
So let's think through what powers of i actually look like,

276
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:52,320
because this is going to be the only thing we really need to plug in complex values into this exp function.

277
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,160
And the way this can work, if I pull out my infinite supply of unit circles,

278
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:03,340
is to remember that multiplication in the complex plane includes a rotation component.

279
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,980
And because i has a magnitude of one, there's only rotation.

280
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,880
So multiplying by i has the effect of rotating 90 degrees.

281
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,700
If you multiply by i twice, okay, i squared, you end up 180 degrees around.

282
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,640
Reassuring, it's supposed to have a square of negative one, and this geometry lines up with that fact.

283
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:30,600
If we multiply by itself three times to get i cubed, it ends up being a vector pointing straight down.

284
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,740
Multiplying by itself a fourth time, 90 degrees, takes us back to one.

285
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,040
So i to the fourth is one, and then after that they all start repeating.

286
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,580
So basically all you need to know is where is that exponent with respect to powers of four.

287
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,480
If it's a power of four, you're at one.

288
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,440
If it's one above a power of four, you're at i.

289
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,340
Now the trickiness of the question was to also include the nuance of whether this is only for positive powers or negative powers.

290
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:05,280
But what a negative power means, if we write something like i to the negative one, that's defined to be one over i,

291
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,960
the number such that when you multiply by it, you get one.

292
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,320
And you can see that that's actually the same as i cubed.

293
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,400
This is the same as i cubed because that's a number where when we multiply it by i, we get one.

294
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,960
Negative one, that's also one below a multiple of four.

295
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,660
And in general, anything that's one below all the negative multiples of four will also satisfy this property.

296
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:38,300
So it's a little tricky question, but it's just because I wanted you to think deeply about this idea that powers of i, of whole numbers, just have us ticking forward by 90 degrees.

297
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,380
And finally, we can have our fun.

298
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:49,580
We can take our crazy exp function, and we could plug it into Python if we wanted to and see how things play there.

299
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,120
But first, let me go ahead and visualize it for you.

300
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,080
So I'm going to, uh, let's see, that circle is already suggestively drawn, but I don't want that to be there.

301
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:07,160
I just want you to think about this polynomial where I'm going to plug in i scaled by some kind of constant, which very suggestively I'm going to give the name theta.

302
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,580
And then what that means is taking one plus i times theta plus i theta squared over two, on and on.

303
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,280
And just as an example, let's crank theta on up until it equals one.

304
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,980
And let's try to think pretty deeply about what this actually means computationally.

305
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,900
The first term is one, which we might draw with this green vector on the bottom, pointed one unit to the right.

306
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,620
The next term is going to be i times one, so just i. It's pointed straight up with magnitude one.

307
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,200
Now think about what the next term is.

308
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:46,300
It's going to be i squared, or i theta squared, but theta is one, so it's i squared, which is negative one over two.

309
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,240
So that's why this next vector is pointed to the left, and it has length one half.

310
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,480
Okay? Then after that, i cubed is pointed straight down, and we divide it by six.

311
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,800
So now we just have an itty bitty vector that is of magnitude one sixth, and then they just get smaller from there.

312
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,500
The next one is pointed to the right, but it has magnitude one over twenty four, and they just shrink a whole bunch.

313
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,720
And so we get something. It's clear that this is a computation that makes sense to do.

314
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,920
It's not clear how we would know where it ends up. That feels like it's going to require real math to have some kind of theory behind it.

315
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,360
We could be computational, and pull up Python, and remember that it actually has built-in support for complex numbers.

316
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,480
If I write something like complex of two three, it gives me a complex number with real part two and imaginary part three,

317
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,940
and what's cool is that it already knows the rules for multiplication.

318
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,380
So I could multiply this by other things, it knows how to take their product, very cool.

319
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:48,940
Now given that our definition of this exponential function, if you'll remember, was only ever in terms of raising something to a power and scaling it by a factorial,

320
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,400
and then adding all those terms up, well it should make sense to plug in something like complex zero one,

321
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,520
which is how we write i in Python, and see what it pops out.

322
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,660
And indeed, it crunches through the numbers, and it gets for us something whose real part is evidently around point five four, who knew?

323
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:13,560
And whose imaginary part is around point eight four, and in terms of our visual, you know, that checks out.

324
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,460
It looks like the real part is a little above point five, so point five four, I believe that.

325
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,740
And the imaginary part is, it claimed what, point eight four? Yeah, that seems about right.

326
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,500
So at this point, we can actually think, what is the claim of Euler's formula?

327
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,340
What is it telling us about the behavior here?

328
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:38,920
And my hope is that Euler's formula might have started off mysterious, but mysterious in a bad way, okay?

329
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,260
Because when you initially see this expression, e to the i theta is equal to cosine theta plus i sine theta,

330
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,420
telling you that, oh, I guess imaginary exponents get us on the unit circle,

331
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,880
it doesn't leave you wondering about a real pattern, it leaves you wondering what the convention is, right?

332
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,740
It leaves you wondering, WTF.

333
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,580
However, right now what we can see is what this is saying is if I plug in i times theta,

334
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,460
evidently that's the same as walking around a unit circle.

335
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,620
Now that feels very substantive, there's a lot of content to be had in that expression,

336
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,060
because if we go to our visual, what it's telling us is that if I, if I crank up this value of theta,

337
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,680
the place that the sum of vectors converges always sits on a circle that's one of radius one.

338
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,560
That's not obvious. If you just look at this expression and you think through what it's saying very literally,

339
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,460
that is definitely not something that just pops right out of it.

340
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,460
But it becomes a lot more beautiful, in my opinion, because you're no longer asking questions of convention,

341
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,120
you're asking questions of the universe, of actual patterns.

342
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,640
So just to take the most famous input that there is, plugging in pi around 3.14,

343
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
let's think about what this is actually saying.

344
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,300
It's saying, okay, the first term is one, so we've got our vector pointed one unit to the right.

345
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,040
The next term is i times pi.

346
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,420
Okay, so that's going to be a vector that's pointed up because of the i with a length of pi around 3.14,

347
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,140
which it looks like it is.

348
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,540
The next one is going to be i squared times pi squared over two.

349
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,660
So that i squared means that it's negative, okay, it's pointing to the left.

350
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,320
And I guess the magnitude is pi squared over two.

351
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,860
We could do a quick gut check if we wanted and just ask ourselves, you know, what is pi squared?

352
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:29,480
It's around 9.8, same as the gravity on Earth in terms of meters per second squared, which is always fun.

353
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,260
And dividing that by two, it looks like it's 4.93.

354
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,940
Okay, does that check out?

355
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,200
Yeah, I buy it that the length of this vector is just less than five, so 4.93.

356
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,400
And then the next one, because of the i cubed, is pointed down and the magnitude is pi cubed over six.

357
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,420
Evidently that's around the magnitude of pi cubed over six.

358
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,480
And so far the vectors have been getting bigger, but it's at this point they start turning around

359
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,980
because basically each time on the, for each new term, the numerator gets an extra pi thrown in.

360
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,940
But the denominator now gets an extra four thrown in.

361
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,480
Like going from six to 24, you're multiplying by a four.

362
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,240
And then it's going to get an extra five and then a six.

363
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,780
So the denominator is going to start growing much more than the numerator,

364
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,940
which is why the vectors shrink and shrink and start to converge to a point.

365
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,220
So the i in there is what's letting these vectors all turn 90 degrees each time and give us this very pretty spiral sum.

366
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,340
And the claim of Euler's formula is this very fascinating fact,

367
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,340
that evidently when the vectors are rotating according to powers of i,

368
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,420
and when their lengths are changing according to powers of pi divided by n factorial,

369
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,920
they all conspire in just the right way, that they land at the point negative one.

370
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,500
That's interesting. Still mysterious, but mysterious in a good way.

371
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,600
And it's making an even stronger claim, which is that any other angle that we might put in,

372
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,620
it puts us on a unit circle at that angle.

373
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,580
Now this is especially mysterious when we consider the fact that as we let this value just continue increasing,

374
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,820
it's not even clear that the function would be periodic, right?

375
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,000
Because as theta increases, more and more of the vectors become relevant,

376
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,260
because it takes longer and longer for the denominator of our terms to win out,

377
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,500
and yet they stay very nicely constrained onto the unit circle.

378
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,180
I think that's interesting.

379
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,960
So just to do a last little concept check here,

380
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm going to ask you one final question to basically see if you've been paying attention,

381
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,260
see if the claims made stand to reason.

382
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,500
So getting rid of our powers of i,

383
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,080
the last question is a wind-down question of sorts for the evening.

384
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,580
Which of the following values is closest to e to the 3i?

385
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,040
So as usual, this is the link you can go to.

386
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,980
Which of the following values is closest to e to the 3i?

387
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:25,760
Now as you're answering, let me just remind you that the main takeaway I want you to have from this lesson

388
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,180
is that the way that you read this is not to think about a constant e raised to an imaginary power.

389
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,560
Because that doesn't really make sense when we're thinking of powers as repeated multiplication.

390
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,760
However, what does...

391
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,640
Let's see...

392
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,700
Seems like we have some controversy over the last question.

393
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,880
We'll address that in a moment.

394
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,700
But what you should think about here is the fact that e to the x is shorthand for this general polynomial, okay?

395
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,480
And this general polynomial, it turns out to be very relevant in things like calculus in a future lecture.

396
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:08,480
I'd like to start talking about why this idea of x to the n over n factorial and adding them up.

397
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,000
Why is that useful? Why would anyone care? Why would it give rotation?

398
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,380
But if you know that that's how to read it, hopefully this isn't a nonsense question.

399
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,920
And it's not one that just asks you to blindly believe convention.

400
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:26,800
It kind of asks you to blindly believe a claim about the fact that this follows a circle, but we'll address that in the next lecture.

401
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,020
And I think that's enough time to go ahead and grade this.

402
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,120
And the correct answer is b, which around 3800 of you nicely got. Well done, well done indeed.

403
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,380
And it's around negative 0.99 plus 0.14i.

404
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,560
So the expectation isn't that you're a machine who can calculate that in your head.

405
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,440
It's instead the idea that if we go over to our visual, where we're plugging in values of theta,

406
00:41:52,760 --> 00:42:01,160
and you ask what happens when you plug in 3, that the claim of Euler's formula is that we walk three units around a unit circle.

407
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:08,880
Knowing that pi units takes us all the way around, three units should take us so that the real part is really quite close to negative 1,

408
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,440
and the imaginary part is something positive.

409
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,420
And of the options you were given, those were the only ones in there.

410
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:23,180
Now the very last thing that I would like to emphasize here is that nothing about this actual expression has to do with the number E.

411
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,520
Has to do with the number 2.71828, on and on.

412
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:35,980
If we were to go to the computation taking place, if I plug in something like exp of a complex number whose real part is 0 and whose imaginary part is pi,

413
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:43,280
which at first it might look like it's outputting something other than negative 1, but it's saying the real part is negative 1,

414
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,400
and then some numerical error because, partly because of how we defined it, you know, only doing so many terms,

415
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,300
and partly because computers can't do infinite precision.

416
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,540
The imaginary part, it might look like it's saying 3.45, but really it's saying times 10 to the negative 16th, that's what that means.

417
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:09,520
So it's basically 0. If you wanted to see this we could maybe import numpy and do something like round it.

418
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,080
So I can round this thing to, I don't know, 8 decimal places, and we see that, okay, it's basically negative 1.

419
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,220
So this is the function that we wrote, showing us that e to the pi i is negative 1.

420
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,160
But what I'd like to emphasize is that nowhere in that function did we include the value 2.718.

421
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,480
In fact, nowhere in the computer's memory during the execution of this computation would it encounter the value 2.718.

422
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:43,220
I would submit to you that that value is not relevant to the equation e to the pi i equals negative 1, which is kind of funny, right?

423
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:52,080
Let's at least write out what the relationship is, because, you know, I'm not going to say there's no connection between e and pi, there is one,

424
00:43:52,080 --> 00:44:04,100
but I think when you write the very famous celebrity equation e to the pi i equals negative 1, it heavily overstates the connection that there is between this e and that pi.

425
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:14,240
What's really going on is that we have this function exp that we've defined, and that when you plug in real values, okay,

426
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:26,380
when you plug in real numbers, for the reasons we talked about earlier, it makes sense to write exp of x in terms of whatever its value at 1 happens to be, exp of 1 raised to the x.

427
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,520
And that we often call that value exp of 1 e, okay? This is a property of the function.

428
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:48,260
Another fact about this is that when we plug in imaginary numbers, the claim of Euler's formula, which I haven't shown why it's true, but the claim that it's making is that it's periodic, basically.

429
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,940
That it walks around a circle, and it's periodic with a period of 2 pi i.

430
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:06,040
Basically when you increase that input by 2 pi i, you get back to where you started, and even more specifically that you do so by walking along a circle.

431
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:16,380
So it's saying that each of these constants is a child of the function exp of x, right? But the way that they're related kind of happens along different dimensions.

432
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,960
That I think is the healthy way to understand this formula.

433
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,260
Now in the next lecture, we are going to be talking about why this thing walks around in circles.

434
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:35,240
And that necessarily involves a little bit of calculus, so we're going to get a little bit of calculus into the mix here, but as minimal as I can.

435
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,420
And before then, I want to leave you with some homework.

436
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:49,780
Because if you remember, the core property that related this strange polynomial with factorials to the number e was that addition in the input is the same as multiplication in the output.

437
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:59,220
So before next time, I won't grade this, this is just, you know, to do on your own time in your own way.

438
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:11,940
Question number 1, I want you to show that when you fully expand exp of x times exp of y, and you know, you might have written down for yourself what this function is, it's all those factorial things.

439
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:23,840
Show that when you expand that out, each term has the form x to the k times y to the m divided by k factorial m factorial for certain whole numbers k and m.

440
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,580
And remember, 0 factorial is defined to be 1.

441
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:44,840
Question number 2, show that when you expand exp of x plus y, so addition in the input, each term is going to look like 1 over n factorial times n choose k times x to the k times y to the n minus k.

442
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:54,080
If you're not familiar with this term n choose k, take a look at the binomial formula, I'm sure there's plenty of excellent videos on YouTube about it, I'll leave links in the description as I find them.

443
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,020
But show that that's true.

444
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,220
Question 3, compare the two results that you just found to explain this key property.

445
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,060
The thing that relates this function to some special constant and the idea of raising it to powers.

446
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:20,440
And then if you're up for the bonus question, this is kind of the, this is for all of the extra credit in the world, justify, see if you can say, will this result still be true if x and y are complex numbers?

447
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,160
And will it still be true if they're matrices?

448
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:30,580
That actually I think is a very important exercise to go through to understand when this is true for what kinds of inputs.

449
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:39,060
Because like I said, as you get deeper and deeper into math, this exp function remains very relevant and you start plugging in things that seem wilder and wilder.

450
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:44,780
It's useful, it is genuinely useful, and it's important to know what properties carry over and which ones don't.

451
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:53,400
Now, I was talking a little about this lecture with a friend beforehand, and I mentioned the spirit of the lockdown math series being like high school classes.

452
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,320
And you know, he looks at me quizzically and he's like, is this, is that a high school topic?

453
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,480
And the honest answer is I don't know.

454
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,400
What I can say is that it is the case that in high school, we came across the formula e to the i theta.

455
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,660
I think the first time that I ever saw it, it was in, you know, learning about complex numbers.

456
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:21,960
It was just taught as the polar representation of complex numbers to emphasize this idea that when you multiply two things, you multiply their magnitudes and you add their angles.

457
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,020
But it was just this strange thing handed from on high.

458
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:32,660
The usual way that we teach a relationship between e to the x in this polynomial comes from a piece of calculus called Taylor series.

459
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:39,600
And you start with the function e to the x, always defined in a little bit of a wishy-washy way, depending on the course that you're taking.

460
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,240
And then you show that it's connected to this polynomial.

461
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
But I think there's no reason we can't go the other way around.

462
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,960
And I actually wish that I had seen this.

463
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:55,280
I wish that I had known from the beginning that through math, especially through deeper math, that this is what the expression e to the x actually means.

464
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,560
So with that, I'm going to call an end to the proper lecture and just take a couple more questions from the audience to finish things off.

465
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,120
Maintain the interactivity that is the spirit of our lectures.

466
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,140
All right. Great, great. We have more discussion. I love this.

467
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:17,600
Crispin's proof is wrong. The constant function f of x equals zero. Ah, wonderful. Excellent counter example.

468
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,040
I think this was maybe niggling in the back of my mind. It's like, I don't think this is unique. Great.

469
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,200
So you have the case of a function that is constantly equal to zero.

470
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:34,020
And I think whoever was asking a question earlier that I didn't quite understand, I think this must be what you were getting at.

471
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:42,180
And I didn't. I just wasn't reading it properly. But yeah, that would be a function where f of zero is not necessarily one. Beautiful.

472
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,380
All right. So that question that I said was wrong and then I said it wasn't wrong, it actually was wrong.

473
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:52,500
So thank you very much, Eric Moss. And to everyone who can think more clearly about things than I can while live on camera.

474
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:59,180
And then another person points out exactly the same thing. I love this. This is just like a real class.

475
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,160
I'm up here. I get to make mistakes. You're down there. You get to correct them. And I think it makes it better for everyone watching.

476
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:12,200
There's a legitimate discussion to be had. What's relevant in the case of the exp function is just that it's not constantly zero.

477
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:19,240
That it does, in fact, equal one at the input x equals zero. But I love this discussion.

478
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,660
And I think I can imagine no better place to end things than right there. So as always, thank you for joining.

479
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:33,540
I hope this helped provide a little bit of a different perspective than what you usually see in other classes on what's a very popular topic on the Internet, at least as math goes.

480
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,160
And next time we're going to talk about why it's true, where the circle would come from. I hope to see you then.

481
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,000
.
