00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to Lockdown Math! Today we are going to be talking about Euler's formula.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
And just to give you a little sense of where we're going to be ending up with this lesson,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to go ahead and show you what we're aiming for at the end, which is a certain visualization.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, I don't expect you to necessarily understand this immediately,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but the point is that this is something we're going to walk towards.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What we're going to analyze is an extension of the idea of exponentials in a way that works in the complex plane.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the illustration that you're looking at is showing very literally what the claim of Euler's formula is.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because what I want you to appreciate is what the actual statement says,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
rather than letting it be shrouded in a certain mystery or a certain question of what the conventions are.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, needless to say, this is kind of a confusing thing.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We've got this spiral of vectors, and if it's not entirely clear, don't worry about it.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I just want to give you a little sense of where we're going to be going with this.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But before any of that, let's take a step back and remember where were we.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Back in the end of the last lesson, when we were talking about complex numbers,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
one of the key types of complex numbers that we were looking at were those that existed on the unit circle.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So here I have a little complex plane drawn. We've got the real number line with the points 1 and negative 1 indicated.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've got the imaginary number line, i being the square root of negative 1.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And if you remember, one of the main points that we emphasized last time is that when you have a number who's sitting one unit away from the origin at some angle theta,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
multiplying by this number has the effect of rotating things by that angle.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is incredibly important throughout physics, throughout electrical engineering, all throughout math.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You see these numbers everywhere. They describe wave mechanics, they're very important for polynomials.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's really hard to overstate how important numbers that sit on this unit circle are.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now one way that you could write them is with the real and imaginary parts.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And based on lecture 2, if we know our trigonometry, the x coordinate is going to be the cosine of that angle,

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and the y coordinate, which is the imaginary part, is going to be i times the sine of that angle.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So you might think, all throughout physics, all throughout electrical engineering, you see the expression cosine of theta plus i sine of theta.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In fact, what you often see is another form of this.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Almost always, you see this written down as e to the power i times theta.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And this relationship is what's known as Euler's formula.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now e is a special constant of nature, and I always remember in high school, it was never crystal clear to me exactly what it was.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It was something that was just kind of handed down, okay, it's 2.71828, on and on.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And we were just taking, you know, we were to take this as an analog of pi.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's an irrational number that evidently the universe finds significant.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I had one calculus teacher who would tell us it was the Andrew Jackson number, because the president, Andrew Jackson, served two terms.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He was the seventh president, and he was elected in 1828.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, there you go. I don't know if Andrew Jackson appreciated this relationship that he had to Euler, but it always helped me remember the number.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, just to gauge sentiment, because I'm not entirely sure where the audience is, I want to know what your current relationship with this particular formula is.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So we're going to do a poll to start, and this poll is mostly going to be helpful to me.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, polling up some of the warm-up questions that we had, where evidently most of you, if you were to choose one of Euler's formulas, would have gone with the one that we're talking about today, which is great, you know, appropriate given where we want to head.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As a poll that's actually going to be helpful to me, let me ask you, which of the following best describes your relationship with the formula e to the power i theta equals cosine of theta plus i times the sine of theta?

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay? And the options here are that you've never seen it before, totally understandable, that you've seen it but you're confused by it, that you still don't understand it but you've grown used to it, or that you understand it well.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, as you can see, answers are rolling in. Please participate! This is going to be way fun if more of you participate. You can go to 3b1b.co slash live, link is also in the description, that forwards you to the place where you can answer this poll.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And while answers are rolling in, I just want to remind us of a more famous variant of this expression that you often see, which is basically what happens when you plug in pi.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, so, if we say e to the i times pi, now we're thinking of pi as an angle, it's a number of radians, a distance around the unit circle, you would plug in cosine of pi plus i times the sine of pi.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay? And the way to think about that is to look at the unit circle and ask, what if you walked around until you'd walked a total distance of pi?

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know, if it's a lake with a radius 1 and you walk around the boundary until you've gone a distance of pi, kind of by the definition of what pi is, that takes you halfway around the circle.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So the x component, cosine, is going to be negative 1, and then the y component, sine, is actually 0, so there's no imaginary part, it's just negative 1.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And this gets us, you know, what might be the most celebrity equation in all of math, e to the i times pi is equal to negative 1.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay? But it's baffling, genuinely baffling, because you've got this idea of raising a constant, which is a little wishy-washy to start with, what is e, but you're raising it to an imaginary power.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And if you don't understand what that means, you're in good company, I think very few people in the world actually do.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now turning back to our poll, where we've got a good number of responses, and a pretty good spread too, I'm genuinely curious to know, who am I talking to right now?

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay? Because it looks like we have a pretty even distribution among all camps.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Alright, so the number one most common answer is c, which is those who still don't understand it but they've grown used to it.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This, I'm going to guess, includes people like math majors or engineering majors or people who have gone into a technical field, where it comes up a lot, so you have to grow used to it.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is also revealing the fact that even though these lectures are targeted at high school students, that this channel has a certain base demographic to start with, so sometimes those sitting in the audience, it's more like adults who have walked in and are sitting in the back of the class.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Very happy to see that d, I understand it well, is the second most common answer.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm curious among those who answer d, if by the end of the lecture they would say that what they understood about this is the same as what I'm going to teach.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because for example, I would make the claim that this formula actually has nothing to do with the number e, okay?

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That the number e doesn't actually play a role in what this formula is computationally saying.

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I'd be curious if those who claim that they understand it well would agree with that statement.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
After that we have those who've seen it but are confused by it, and at the very end is the actual target demographic of those who've never seen it before.

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, I don't know if it's fair to call that the target demographic because I think sometimes you see it in an odd circumstance here or there, but definitely those who answered a or b, you're my people.

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're the ones that I want to talk to about this, okay?

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But let's say you see this, okay? You see this weird formula e to the pi i, or the generalization e to the i times some angle.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think the healthy reaction to have to this, okay, if you're just seeing this for the first time, the healthy question to ask is w t f, okay?

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What is the function at play, and how is it defined, okay?

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's the function? Because in this case the function is e to the x, and we're plugging in certain imaginary inputs.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I think a lot of people think that that refers to taking a number e and multiplying by itself some number of times, and that x describes how often you're multiplying by itself.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And that yeah, there's some notion of extending that to things like one half or negative one, or any kind of real number, but that it's based in this idea of repeated multiplication.

70
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now the thing that makes this equation misleading is that that's not the function. That is not what e to the x is referring to.

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's emphasize that very heavily. This is not what e to the x means. This is not its convention.

72
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Instead, what has emerged in math is that we use e to the x to be a shorthand for another function.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A function which I'm going to give the name exp. This is how you often see it in literature.

74
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And it's defined to be a certain polynomial. It's one plus x plus x squared divided by two plus x cubed divided by six plus x to the power four divided by twenty four.

75
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And in fact it's not a polynomial, it's an infinite polynomial. We add infinitely many terms, each of which look like x to the n divided by n factorial.

76
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The proper term for this is a series. In practice, if you're actually computing this, because that denominator grows so quickly, you can chop off the series pretty early to get an approximate value for what this actually is.

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now right away we can see that this is going to work for lots of kinds of x that we could plug in. Anything where we know how to raise x to a power, just a whole number power, multiply it by itself, and where we know how to divide by a factorial and add those together, we can come up with a nice meaning for what this exp function means.

78
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But before we jump into things like complex numbers and throwing that in, I think it would be very unsatisfying to do that if we didn't first draw the connection to the number e and the idea of repeated multiplication.

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because on the surface, this infinite polynomial seems very different from the idea of some special constant of nature e and raising it to a power.

80
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So let's build up a little familiarity. We're going to take a couple minutes to do this. And it's a very healthy exercise, I think, to become friends with this function by starting to plug in a couple different values.

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
One of the first you might plug in is the number 1. So that way we get 1 and then x is 1, so that's 1. x squared is still 1, so that's 1 half.

82
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And then 1 sixth. And then 1 twenty fourth. And in general we're adding 1 divided by n factorial.

83
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In math we say that this is a series that converges in the sense that as we add more and more terms, it approaches a certain value and it gets closer and closer to some specific value.

84
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And that value ends up being around 2.71828, the Andrew Jackson number.

85
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But at this point, just think of it as it was going to be something. x of 1 was going to be something. This is what x of 1 happens to be.

86
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
At the moment there isn't necessarily anything special about that. But let's say you wanted to plug in other values.

87
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Just to get a little practice with what that would look like, if I wanted x of 2, it would look like 1 plus 2 plus 2 squared over 2 plus 2 cubed over 6.

88
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And in principle if you were on a desert island and you just needed to compute x of 2, you could work this all out by hand if you were comfortable with long division.

89
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But of course we live in the modern world, we have computers, we have programming. So I think to make this especially concrete, let's go ahead and actually implement this function so that we can calculate a couple values.

90
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And so that it's not a black box, it's not just a calculator that's been handed to us, we implement it so we know exactly what it's doing.

91
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So for that, let's go ahead and pull up a little Python. This is Desmos, we might look at that a little bit later. Right now let's be a little bit more programmatic.

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's pull up some Python, let's import some math, because that's a sign you're always going to have some fun.

93
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Then I'm going to define the exp function that's going to take in some number x.

94
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And what I want is to return something that looks like 1 plus x plus x squared over 2, where in Python this double, what do you call it, an asterisk, this double asterisk sign is how we do exponentiation.

95
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then x cubed over 6, and we kind of want to add that up a whole bunch.

96
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Of course instead of typing all that out, we can use a little special syntax where I'm going to say, I want you to return a sum of a bunch of terms.

97
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Each term is going to look like raising x to some power, and it knows what x is because that's what was handed to it.

98
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
x to some power divided by the factorial. Factorial of n. And that's built into this math package that we imported.

99
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I'm just going to do this for values of n that start at 0. 0 factorial is defined to be 1 if you're curious.

100
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We could talk all about factorials of weird values at a later date, but that's all you need to know here.

101
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And I'm just going to have it range up to 100 because 100 factorial is going to be huge.

102
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So that's going to be plenty big enough for a denominator to be small enough that those later terms don't contribute a lot.

103
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So even if you don't know Python, I hope that this is a reasonably clear way to turn the math into something that our computer can chew on,

104
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and crunch through the numbers so that we don't have to.

105
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So for example, if we type x of 1, we get the Andrew Jackson number. 2.71828, on and on.

106
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I could type in x of 2, and it looks like that's around 7.389.

107
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So maybe we even write that in our notes. We go over here and say, interesting, x of 2 was about 7.389.

108
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay. And if you spend a long time just kind of playing around with this, okay, I think it's not obvious that you might find this,

109
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but if you were just plugging in a couple values, x of 3, x of 4,

110
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
one important fact you might stumble across is that if I add two numbers in the input, okay,

111
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
so in this case I get 1096 when I plug in 7, which is 3 plus 4,

112
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that actually ends up being the same as if I plug in x of 3 times x of 4.

113
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay. So adding the input corresponds to multiplying in the output.

114
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And 3 and 4 weren't special here, I could have done, you know, 5.5 and 3.2, and that would have gotten me some value.

115
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And if instead I had added those together, okay, it gets the same value.

116
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That is not at all obvious, okay? So I think that would be a genuine discovery to have with respect to this function,

117
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
with this polynomial, if that was something that you found.

118
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And it's important enough that I want to write it down.

119
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:57,000
exp of a plus b is actually the same thing as exp of a times exp of b.

120
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Now if you just look at the polynomial, this is not clear.

121
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay, this is not something that, like, you look at it and say, oh yes, of course, it couldn't have been any other way.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
At the end of today's lesson, though, I'm going to give you guys some homework, and yes, homework will make you learn better.

123
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And what we're going to do is go through a couple problems that are going to have you show that this fact is true.

124
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That simply from the polynomial, and the fact that it includes these factorial terms, excuse me,

125
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that's going to be enough to show this very special property.

126
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Now why am I calling it a very special property?

127
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Well, I want to ask you a certain question that will hopefully make this clear.

128
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And it really is important that you think this through yourself, because I think if we, uh, if I just kind of tell you the implications here,

129
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
it's not going to sink in to the same extent as if you really noodle with it yourself.

130
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I'm going to pull up another question, and I'm going to give you some time to think on this one.

131
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What the question asks us is to suppose that we have some function f of x that has this special property,

132
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
where adding two numbers in the input, f of a plus b, gives the same result as multiplying in the output, f of a times f of b,

133
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and that this is true for any real number, a and b.

134
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay? Suppose you have some function that satisfies this property, who cares how it's defined?

135
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Whether it's through this polynomial, through other means.

136
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Which of the following is true?

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
One of the options is that f of 5 is equal to f of 1 raised to the power 5.

138
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Another is that f of 1 half is equal to the square root of f of 1.

139
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And the other is f of negative 1 equals 1 divided by f of 1.

140
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Now very important, I'm not asking does there exist some function f where these three things will be true.

141
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm asking which of these necessarily has to be true only from that property.

142
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So you shouldn't be able to contrive some sort of adversarial function that doesn't satisfy it, okay?

143
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And then you have various options for which collection of these three things is true.

144
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to give you some time to think about this because I really do think it's important.

145
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So I'm going to turn up our pause and ponder music to get us in the mood.

146
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And take a desperately needed drink of water.

147
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
While you're noodling on that, I'm going to go ahead and take a question from the audience.

148
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Where it looks like Serft asks, what do you think is more interesting to someone who is a newcomer to higher level math?

149
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Special case theorems like e to the i pi, or more general cases like e to the i x.

150
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh that is such a great question. By the way, anyone who wants to ask questions, go to Twitter and just use the hashtag lockdown math.

151
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Those will be forwarded to me.

152
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think the best way to learn is to have specific examples and really let yourself understand the patterns represented by those specific examples and then generalize them.

153
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
For the specific one that you have here, I think if you just see e to the i pi, that doesn't really count as a good specific example that explains the generality.

154
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's more that you're plugging in one particular number into a formula.

155
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So in this case e to the i x, as you'll see, it has everything to do with circular motion and between this lecture and the next one, we're going to talk about why that relation might be there.

156
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So the form of having specific examples that aids your understanding wouldn't be a number like e to the i pi.

157
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It would be building a relationship with circular motions in other circumstances, like studying physics where you have a tetherball with some kind of centripetal force and it's orbiting.

158
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Or like orbital mechanics. Anything where you're really understanding the nature of circular motion.

159
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That actually prepares you for understanding e to the i x as a generality a little bit better.

160
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So with all of that, answers are still rolling in and I don't want you to feel rushed.

161
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So I'm going to give a little bit more time here, actually.

162
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Because remember, you need to really be sure that if you're saying that something like 2 or 3 or 1 is included in your answer, that any function with this special property necessarily follows that.

163
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay?

164
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, let's see if we can grade it when the top answer is the year.

165
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So 2017, that's a little bit in the past. 2013, we're losing the top answer. Interesting, people are changing their mind. It's like we're going back in time.

166
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So it looks like a couple people are, oh now we're in the future, 2023.

167
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, so we're actually seeing people think about it and thinking, hang on, is it the case that option 3 here is necessarily true?

168
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And they're really being critical about that. So that's a good sign.

169
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you want to keep thinking about it, please do. But for the sake of continuing with the lesson, I'm going to go ahead and lock things in here and see how people ended up answering.

170
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So it looks like 2030 of you, the decade in the future, believe that all three of these are necessarily true.

171
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Second most common answer was B, they only believe that the first one is true.

172
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then after that, people who either included number 2 or number 3.

173
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And the correct answer is that all of them are. And it's very interesting to walk through why. I do think it's very elucidating.

174
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So let's go ahead and do this.

175
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The first one, which it seems like a majority of you believe, is that if we plug in something like 5 to a function with this special property, that it'll be the same as taking f of 1 raised to the fifth.

176
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Now the reason is that we could also write 5 as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

177
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And this property of addition in the input becoming multiplication in the output means that's the same thing as writing x of 1 multiplied by itself 5 times.

178
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It lets you rewrite the whole thing in terms of x of 1, which I'm going to say 5 times.

179
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This is the same as taking x of 1 raised to the power 5.

180
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And here when I'm writing exponentials, anytime you see a natural number or a whole number, it can literally mean multiplying by itself that number of times.

181
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's not the same as the fact that e to the x is a shorthand for this crazy polynomial.

182
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So that can sometimes get a little confusing, the exponent is playing two different roles.

183
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And we might give x of 1 a special name, a shorthand. Let's just call it e for short.

184
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's not why we call this number e, by the way. It's also not because this is what Euler's name starts with.

185
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's just because whenever Euler was using this, the first time in a particular book, he was partial to vowels and the vowel a had already been used.

186
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So e was just his arbitrary letter.

187
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay, so simply by virtue of this property, we can see that exp of 5 has to be written in terms of x of 1.

188
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Now a little bit trickier was the question about plugging in one half.

189
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay? And the key to solving this, it's a little bit tricky, is to think about what happens when we multiply that by itself.

190
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Exp of one half times exp of one half, because of this property, has to satisfy, or I should say has to equal exp of one half plus exp of one half.

191
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Which is of course exp of 1, which let's say we're using the shorthand and we call it e.

192
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So what does that mean? Exp of one half has to be a number such that multiplying it by itself equals e.

193
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well that's what we mean when we write square roots.

194
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And the last one was talking about negative inputs. So just as an example, if we inputted something like negative 1.

195
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So the key here is to ask about multiplying it by the value when you plug in 1.

196
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
By this rule, that addition in the input turns into multiplication in the output, that has to be the same as exp of 0.

197
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Now what is exp of 0? Ooh, you know what I'm realizing? Hmm.

198
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think I might have actually made the, entered a wrong answer there.

199
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Because in our case, in our case exp of 0 actually does come out to be the number 1.

200
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay, so if we plug in 0 for x, then all of these, you add them together, the only term that matters is 1.

201
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So exp of negative 1 times exp of 1 is equal to exp of 0, which is 1.

202
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So this is true in the case of exp. I, I can't actually think to myself right now if that's necessarily true.

203
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You know, if we look at our question, where it's saying all we know about f is that f of a plus b is f of a times f of b.

204
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If that necessarily implies that f of 0 is going to be 1.

205
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And I don't think it does, I think we could construct a function.

206
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, because we could just scale e to the x by some other amount.

207
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay, yeah, so actually what's graded here is not entirely correct.

208
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The correct answer would be only 1 and 2. I think.

209
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Someone correct me on Twitter if I'm wrong about that.

210
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But, very interesting.

211
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So if we go back to our paper, let's see.

212
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
In the case of exp, this value at 0 would be 1. What does that imply?

213
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, if we call exp of 1 e, that means we're asking what is the number which when you multiply by e equals 1.

214
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And it would be 1 divided by e.

215
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But yeah, for the general case, we need the added condition that when you plug in 0 you do get 1.

216
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Now the point of all of this, the reason that I'm saying this, is to emphasize why it's reasonable that we use the shorthand.

217
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That when we say exp of x, for real numbers x, why it would be very reasonable to write this as e to the power x.

218
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Because basically this special property means that because you can use the number 1 to access pretty much all the real numbers by adding it to itself or dividing as needed or negating.

219
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And then if you have certain continuity restrictions that will let you extend from rational numbers to all the reals.

220
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But that's a technical point, you don't need to fuss over for what we're doing right now.

221
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It lets you basically express everything that this polynomial can output in terms of what it outputs at the number 1.

222
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So you might read e to the x as just, whatever this polynomial is at the input 1, we can start exponentiating in terms of that.

223
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So that's the connection, right? We could, if we wanted, define the number e to simply be, where is this polynomial at the number 1?

224
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And then all of this would follow.

225
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But I really want to emphasize that only makes sense for real numbers.

226
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because as soon as we start introducing things like complex numbers, you can't just add 1 to itself or subtract and divide and get the number i.

227
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And in math you often do even crazier things, where you plug in things like matrices into this polynomial, which seems weird, but you know, you can take a matrix and square it, you can divide it by 2, you can add all of those together.

228
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And that's actually a very useful thing. It's very useful for a field called differential equations, which in turn is useful for physics.

229
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In quantum mechanics you often plug in these things called operators, which are kind of like the mature older brother of matrices.

230
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And all of that looks totally nonsensical if we're talking about a constant raised to some kind of power.

231
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But what you have to understand is that it's being plugged into this polynomial.

232
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So I understand why we have the convention of writing this as e to the x. It makes sense for real numbers.

233
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But I think that's actually a bad convention as soon as we start extending it, and I think that causes a lot of undue confusion.

234
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So with all of that said, let's finally have some fun and plug in some complex values.

235
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And before we do that, just as kind of a warm up, I want to make sure that we're comfortable with powers of i, because that's what's going to be important here.

236
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So let's pull up our quiz, and let's go ahead and ask one more question, and then I'll take a question from the audience too while you guys think about this.

237
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Remember that i is defined to be a value that satisfies i squared equals negative 1.

238
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So that's defined. For which values of n does i to the power n equal negative i?

239
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So the spirit of this question is to have people thinking deeply about powers of i.

240
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And I wanted it to be a question that's not totally obvious, so one that you do have to put a little mental energy into.

241
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So let's go ahead and take a question from the audience while I take a drink of water.

242
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
f of x equals 0 doesn't work with f of negative 1 equals 1 over f of 1.

243
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, f of x equals 0. Oh, interesting, yeah, okay.

244
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So they're saying that if f of x ever outputs 0, actually I'm not entirely sure what Sam was saying.

245
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
f of x equals 0 doesn't work with f of negative 1 equals 1 over f of 1.

246
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So I guess that fact that f of negative 1 is 1 over f of 1 doesn't imply that the output will ever be 0.

247
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So I could ask for some clarification, but I think that might be getting at the general point of the mistake of the question,

248
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:41,000
which was to assume, to extend the idea of exp a little bit too much, where the fact that exp of 0 equals 1 gives us this other property.

249
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And then Crispin Simmons says 3 is included because f of x plus 0- Oh, okay, yeah, okay, great, great.

250
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah, someone thought this through a little bit more deeply than I can while live and on camera and under some pressure.

251
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
f of x plus 0 is the same as f of x times f of 0, which implies f of x equals 1. Awesome, Crispin, you saved me.

252
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You saved me on this one. That's a beautiful way of thinking about it.

253
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, all of these questions where you have like a property of a function and you're supposed to deduce facts, they can be very subtle.

254
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And so in this case, okay, the question was graded correctly.

255
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The property simply that addition in the input becomes multiplication in the output is enough to imply f of 0 equals 1,

256
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
which in turn locks in the value for f of negative 1.

257
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh, it's so pleasing. One little property can just lock in basic, not the whole real number line, because it didn't assume continuity,

258
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but it locks in pretty much any value you want. Awesome, excellent questions.

259
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I love live stuff. Even if I make errors, it does feel a little more interactive than the usual videos.

260
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So let's see how we're doing on the quiz. Looks like we've still got some answers rolling in.

261
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We're trying to understand which powers of i are equal to negative i.

262
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And the options include multiples of 3 or multiples of 3 as long as they're positive,

263
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
or integers 1 below a multiple of 4 or those where you're restricted to them just being positive.

264
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And I'm going to go ahead and grade this question.

265
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And as always, if you feel like you weren't done by the time I'm locking it in,

266
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
know that that's just for the sake of letting the lesson progress forward.

267
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If you wanted to pause and think about it further yourself, especially if you're watching this later,

268
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
that would be totally in the spirit of these lessons.

269
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Okay, so the majority, or the plurality I guess, of you answered that it's all integers 1 below a multiple of 4, which is correct.

270
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And the second most common answer was basically the same but restricted to positives.

271
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Great, so let's think through what powers of i actually look like,

272
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because this is going to be the only thing we really need to plug in complex values into this exp function.

273
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And the way this can work, if I pull out my infinite supply of unit circles,

274
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
is to remember that multiplication in the complex plane includes a rotation component.

275
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And because i has a magnitude of 1, there's only rotation.

276
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So multiplying by i has the effect of rotating 90 degrees.

277
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If you multiply by i twice, i squared, you end up 180 degrees around.

278
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Reassuring it's supposed to have a square of negative 1, and this geometry lines up with that fact.

279
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If we multiply by itself three times to get i cubed, it ends up being a vector pointing straight down.

280
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Multiplying by itself a fourth time, 90 degrees, takes us back to 1.

281
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So i to the fourth is 1, and then after that they all start repeating.

282
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So basically all you need to know is where's that exponent with respect to powers of 4.

283
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
If it's a power of 4, you're at 1. If it's 1 above a power of 4, you're at i.

284
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Now the trickiness of the question was to also include the nuance of whether this is only for positive powers or negative powers.

285
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But what a negative power means, if we write something like i to the negative 1, that's defined to be 1 over i,

286
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the number such that when you multiply by it, you get 1.

287
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And you can see that that's actually the same as i cubed.

288
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
This is the same as i cubed because that's a number where when we multiply it by i, we get 1.

289
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Negative 1, that's also 1 below a multiple of 4.

290
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And in general, anything that's 1 below all the negative multiples of 4 will also satisfy this property.

291
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So it's a little tricky question, but it's just because I wanted you to think deeply about this idea,

292
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that powers of i, of whole numbers, just have us ticking forward by 90 degrees.

293
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And finally, we can have our fun.

294
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,000
We can take our crazy exp function, and we could plug it into Python if we wanted to and see how things play there.

295
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But first, let me go ahead and visualize it for you.

296
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So I'm going to, uh, let's see, that circle is already suggestively drawn, but I don't want that to be there.

297
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I just want you to think about this polynomial where I'm going to plug in i, scaled by some kind of constant,

298
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
which very suggestively I'm going to give the name theta,

299
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and then what that means is taking 1 plus i times theta plus i theta squared over 2, on and on.

300
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And just as an example, let's crank theta on up until it equals 1.

301
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And let's try to think pretty deeply about what this actually means, computationally.

302
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The first term is 1, which we might draw with this green vector on the bottom, pointed one unit to the right.

303
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The next term is going to be i times 1, so just i. It's pointed straight up with magnitude 1.

304
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Now think about what the next term is.

305
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's going to be i squared, or i theta squared, but theta is 1, so it's i squared, which is negative 1 over 2.

306
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So that's why this next vector is pointed to the left, and it has length one half.

307
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Then after that, i cubed is pointed straight down, and we divide it by 6.

308
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So now we just have an itty bitty vector that is of magnitude one sixth, and then they just get smaller from there.

309
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The next one is pointed to the right, but it has magnitude 1 over 24, and they just shrink a whole bunch.

310
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And so we get something. It's clear that this is a computation that makes sense to do.

311
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's not clear how we would know where it ends up.

312
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That feels like it's going to require real math to have some kind of theory behind it.

313
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
We could be computational, and pull up Python, and remember that it actually has built-in support for complex numbers.

314
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
If I write something like complex of 2, 3, it gives me a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part 3.

315
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And what's cool is that it already knows the rules for multiplication.

316
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So I could multiply this by other things. It knows how to take their product. Very cool.

317
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Now given that, our definition of this exponential function, if you'll remember, was only ever in terms of raising something to a power and scaling it by a factorial.

318
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And then adding all those terms up. Well it should make sense to plug in something like complex 0, 1, which is how we write i in Python, and see what it pops out.

319
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And indeed, it crunches through the numbers, and it gets for us something whose real part is evidently around .54. Who knew?

320
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And whose imaginary part is around .84. And in terms of our visual, you know, that checks out.

321
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It looks like the real part is a little above .5, so .54, I believe that.

322
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And the imaginary part is, it claimed, what, .84? Yeah, that seems about right.

323
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So at this point, we can actually think, what is the claim of Euler's formula?

324
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What is it telling us about the behavior here?

325
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And my hope is that Euler's formula might have started off mysterious, but mysterious in a bad way.

326
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay? Because when you initially see this expression, e to the i theta is equal to cosine theta plus i sine theta, telling you that, oh, I guess imaginary exponents get us on the unit circle.

327
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It doesn't leave you wondering about a real pattern, it leaves you wondering what the convention is, right? It leaves you wondering, WTF.

328
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
However, right now what we can see is what this is saying is if I plug in i times theta, evidently that's the same as walking around a unit circle.

329
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Now that feels very substantive, there's a lot of content to be had in that expression.

330
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Because if we go to our visual, what it's telling us is that if I crank up this value of theta, the place that the sum of vectors converges always sits on a circle that's one of radius one.

331
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's not obvious. If you just look at this expression and you think through what it's saying very literally, that is definitely not something that just pops right out of it.

332
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But it becomes a lot more beautiful, in my opinion, because you're no longer asking questions of convention, you're asking questions of the universe, of actual patterns.

333
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So just to take the most famous input that there is, plugging in pi around 3.14, let's think about what this is actually saying.

334
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's saying, okay, the first term is one, so we've got our vector pointed one unit to the right.

335
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The next term is i times pi. Okay, so that's going to be a vector that's pointed up because of the i with a length of pi around 3.14, which it looks like it is.

336
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The next one is going to be i squared times pi squared over two. So that i squared means that it's negative, okay, it's pointing to the left.

337
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I guess the magnitude is pi squared over two. We could do a quick gut check if we wanted and just ask ourselves, you know, what is pi squared?

338
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's around 9.8, same as the gravity on Earth in terms of meters per second squared, which is always fun.

339
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And dividing that by two, it looks like it's 4.93. Okay, does that check out? Yeah, I buy it that the length of this vector is just less than five, so 4.93.

340
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And then the next one, because of the i cubed, is pointed down and the magnitude is pi cubed over six.

341
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Evidently that's around the magnitude of pi cubed over six. And so far the vectors have been getting bigger, but it's at this point they start turning around.

342
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Because basically each time on the, for each new term, the numerator gets an extra pi thrown in.

343
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But the denominator now gets an extra four thrown in. Like going from six to 24, you're multiplying by a four.

344
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And then it's going to get an extra five and then a six. So the denominator is going to start growing much more than the numerator, which is why the vectors shrink and shrink and start to converge to a point.

345
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So the i in there is what's letting these vectors all turn 90 degrees each time and give us this very pretty spiral sum.

346
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And the claim of Euler's formula is this very fascinating fact that evidently when the vectors are rotating according to powers of i, and when their lengths are changing according to powers of pi divided by n factorial,

347
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
they all conspire in just the right way, that they land at the point negative one. That's interesting. Still mysterious, but mysterious in a good way.

348
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And it's making an even stronger claim, which is that any other angle that we might put in, it puts us on a unit circle at that angle.

349
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Now this is especially mysterious when we consider the fact that as we let this value just continue increasing, it's not even clear that the function would be periodic.

350
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Right? Because as theta increases, more and more of the vectors become relevant, because it takes longer and longer for the denominator of our terms to win out, and yet they stay very nicely constrained onto the unit circle.

351
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think that's interesting. So just to do a last little concept check here, I'm going to ask you one final question to basically see if you've been paying attention, see if the claims made stand to reason.

352
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So getting rid of our powers of i, the last question is a wind-down question of sorts for the evening.

353
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Which of the following values is closest to e to the 3i?

354
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay, so as usual, this is the link you can go to. Which of the following values is closest to e to the 3i?

355
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Now as you're answering, let me just remind you that the main takeaway I want you to have from this lesson is that the way that you read this is not to think about a constant e raised to an imaginary power.

356
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Because that doesn't really make sense when we're thinking of powers as repeated multiplication. However, what does...

357
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Let's see... Seems like we have some controversy over the last question. We'll address that in a moment.

358
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But what you should think about here is the fact that e to the x is shorthand for this general polynomial, okay?

359
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And this general polynomial, it turns out to be very relevant in things like calculus in a future lecture. I'd like to start talking about why this idea of x to the n over n factorial and adding them up.

360
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Why is that useful? Why would anyone care? Why would it give rotation?

361
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But if you know that that's how to read it, hopefully this isn't a nonsense question, and it's not one that just asks you to blindly believe convention.

362
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It kind of asks you to blindly believe a claim about the fact that this follows a circle, but we'll address that in the next lecture.

363
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And I think that's enough time to go ahead and grade this.

364
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And the correct answer is b, which around 3800 of you nicely got. Well done, well done indeed.

365
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And it's around negative 0.99 plus 0.14i.

366
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So the expectation isn't that you're a machine who can calculate that in your head.

367
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's instead the idea that if we go over to our visual, where we're plugging in values of theta, and you ask what happens when you plug in 3.

368
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That the claim of Euler's formula is that we walk 3 units around a unit circle.

369
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Knowing that pi units takes us all the way around, 3 units should take us so that the real part is really quite close to negative 1, and the imaginary part is something positive.

370
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And of the options you were given, those were the only ones in there.

371
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Now the very last thing that I would like to emphasize here is that nothing about this actual expression has to do with the number E.

372
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Has to do with the number 2.71828 on and on.

373
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If we were to go to the computation taking place, if I plug in something like exp of a complex number whose real part is 0 and whose imaginary part is pi.

374
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Which, at first it might look like it's outputting something other than negative 1, but it's saying the real part is negative 1 and then some numerical error.

375
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Partly because of how we defined it, you know, only doing so many terms, and partly because computers can't do infinite precision.

376
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The imaginary part, it might look like it's saying 3.45, but really it's saying times 10 to the negative 16th.

377
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That's what that means.

378
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So it's basically 0. If you wanted to see this we could maybe import numpy and do something like round it.

379
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So I can round this thing to, I don't know, 8 decimal places, and we see that, okay, it's basically negative 1.

380
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So this is the function that we wrote showing us that e to the pi i is negative 1.

381
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But what I'd like to emphasize is that nowhere in that function did we include the value 2.718.

382
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,000
In fact, nowhere in the computer's memory during the execution of this computation would it encounter the value 2.718.

383
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I would submit to you that that value is not relevant to the equation e to the pi i equals negative 1.

384
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Which is kind of funny, right?

385
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Let's at least write out what the relationship is, because, you know, I'm not going to say there's no connection between e and pi, there is one.

386
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But I think when you write the very famous celebrity equation e to the pi i equals negative 1, it heavily overstates the connection that there is between this e and that pi.

387
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:16,000
What's really going on is that we have this function exp that we've defined, and that when you plug in real values, okay, when you plug in real numbers,

388
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:26,000
for the reasons we talked about earlier, it makes sense to write exp of x in terms of whatever its value at 1 happens to be, exp of 1 raised to the x.

389
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And that we often call that value exp of 1 e, okay? This is a property of the function.

390
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Another fact about this is that when we plug in imaginary numbers, the claim of Euler's formula, which I haven't shown why it's true,

391
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
but the claim that it's making is that it's periodic, basically.

392
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That it walks around a circle, and it's periodic with a period of 2 pi i.

393
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Basically when you increase that input by 2 pi i, you get back to where you started.

394
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And even more specifically that you do so by walking along a circle.

395
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So it's saying that each of these constants is a child of the function exp of x, right?

396
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But the way that they're related kind of happens along different dimensions.

397
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
That I think is the healthy way to understand this formula.

398
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Now in the next lecture, we are going to be talking about why this thing walks around in circles.

399
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And that necessarily involves a little bit of calculus, so we're going to get a little bit of calculus into the mix here.

400
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But as minimal as I can.

401
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And before then, I want to leave you with some homework.

402
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Because if you remember, the core property that related this strange polynomial with factorials to the number e,

403
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
was that addition in the input is the same as multiplication in the output.

404
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So before next time, I won't grade this, this is just, you know, to do on your own time in your own way.

405
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Question number one, I want you to show that when you fully expand exp of x times exp of y,

406
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and you know, you might have written down for yourself what this function is, it's all those factorial things.

407
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Show that when you expand that out, each term has the form x to the k times y to the m divided by k factorial m factorial.

408
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
For certain whole numbers k and m.

409
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And remember, zero factorial is defined to be one.

410
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Question number two, show that when you expand exp of x plus y, so addition in the input,

411
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:45,000
each term is going to look like one over n factorial times n choose k, times x to the k times y to the n minus k.

412
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
If you're not familiar with this term n choose k, take a look at the binomial formula,

413
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm sure there's plenty of excellent videos on YouTube about it, I'll leave links in the description as I find them.

414
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But show that that's true.

415
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Question three, compare the two results that you just found to explain this key property.

416
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The thing that relates this function to some special constant and the idea of raising it to powers.

417
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And then if you're up for the bonus question, this is for all of the extra credit in the world,

418
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
justify, see if you can say, will this result still be true if x and y are complex numbers,

419
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
and will it still be true if they're matrices?

420
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That actually I think is a very important exercise to go through to understand when this is true for what kinds of inputs.

421
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Because like I said, as you get deeper and deeper into math, this exp function remains very relevant

422
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and you start plugging in things that seem wilder and wilder.

423
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's useful, it is genuinely useful, and it's important to know what properties carry over and which ones don't.

424
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Now, I was talking a little about this lecture with a friend beforehand,

425
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
and I mentioned the spirit of the lockdown math series being like high school classes.

426
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And you know, he looks at me quizzically and he's like, is this, is that a high school topic?

427
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And the honest answer is I don't know.

428
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What I can say is that it is the case that in high school we came across the formula e to the i theta.

429
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I think the first time that I ever saw it, it was in learning about complex numbers.

430
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It was just taught as the polar representation of complex numbers to emphasize this idea that when you multiply two things,

431
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
you multiply their magnitudes and you add their angles.

432
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
But it was just this strange thing handed from on high.

433
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The usual way that we teach a relationship between e to the x in this polynomial comes from a piece of calculus called Taylor series.

434
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And you start with the function e to the x, always defined in a little bit of a wishy-washy way,

435
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
depending on the course that you're taking, and then you show that it's connected to this polynomial.

436
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
But I think there's no reason we can't go the other way around.

437
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And I actually wish that I had seen this. I wish that I had known from the beginning that through math, especially through deeper math,

438
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that this is what the expression e to the x actually means.

439
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So, with that I'm going to call an end to the proper lecture and just take a couple more questions from the audience to finish things off.

440
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Maintain the inner activity that is the spirit of our lectures.

441
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Alright. Great, great, we have more discussion. I love this.

442
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Crispin's proof is wrong. The constant function f of x equals zero. Ah, wonderful! Excellent counter example.

443
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think this was maybe niggling in the back of my mind. It's like, I don't think this is unique. Great.

444
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So, you have the case of a function that is constantly equal to zero.

445
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I think, okay, whoever was asking a question earlier that I didn't quite understand, I think this must be what you were getting at, and I didn't, I just wasn't reading it properly.

446
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But yeah, that would be a function where f of zero is not necessarily one. Beautiful!

447
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Alright, so that question that I said was wrong and then I said it wasn't wrong, it actually was wrong.

448
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So, thank you very much Eric Maas, and to everyone who can think more clearly about things than I can while live on camera.

449
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And then another person points out exactly the same thing.

450
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I love this! This is just like a real class. I'm up here, I get to make mistakes, you're down there, you get to correct them.

451
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And I think it makes it better for everyone watching. There's a legitimate discussion to be had.

452
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What's relevant in the case of the exp function is just that it's not constantly zero, that it does in fact equal one at the input x equals zero.

453
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But I love this discussion, and I think I can imagine no better place to end things than right there.

454
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So, as always, thank you for joining. I hope this helped provide a little bit of a different perspective than what you usually see in other classes on what's a very popular topic on the internet.

455
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
At least as math goes. And next time we're going to talk about why it's true, where this circle would come from. I hope to see you then.
