00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back to Lockdown Math!

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,840
Today we are going to be talking about Euler's formula.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,709
And just to give you a little sense of where we're going to be 

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,098
ending up with this lesson, I'm going to go ahead and show you 

5
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:12,640
what we're aiming for at the end, which is a certain visualization.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,538
So, I don't expect you to necessarily understand this immediately, 

7
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:19,400
but the point is that this is something we're going to walk towards.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,831
What we're going to analyze is an extension of the idea 

9
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:27,040
of exponentials in a way that works in the complex plane.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,237
And the illustration that you're looking at is showing 

11
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:33,260
very literally what the claim of Euler's formula is.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,866
Because what I want you to appreciate is what the actual statement says, 

13
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:41,140
rather than letting it be shrouded in a certain mystery or a certain question of what the 

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,900
conventions are.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,960
Now, needless to say, this is kind of a confusing thing.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,660
We've got this spiral of vectors, and if it's not entirely clear, don't worry about it.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,560
I just want to give you a little sense of where we're going to be going with this.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,160
But before any of that, let's take a step back and remember where were we.

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,692
Back in the end of the last lesson, when we were talking about complex numbers, 

20
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:04,798
one of the key types of complex numbers that we were looking 

21
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,140
at were those that existed on the unit circle.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,440
So here I have a little complex plane drawn.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,220
We've got the real number line with the points 1 and negative 1 indicated.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,200
We've got the imaginary number line, i being the square root of negative 1.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,133
And if you remember, one of the main points that we emphasized last time is that 

26
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:27,492
when you have a number who's sitting one unit away from the origin at some angle theta, 

27
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:32,060
multiplying by this number has the effect of rotating things by that angle.

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,278
This is incredibly important throughout physics, 

29
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,320
throughout electrical engineering, all throughout math.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,040
You see these numbers everywhere.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,900
They describe wave mechanics, they're very important for polynomials.

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,000
It's really hard to overstate how important numbers that sit on this unit circle are.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,220
Now one way that you could write them is with the real and imaginary parts.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,479
And based on lecture 2, if we know our trigonometry, 

35
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,630
the x coordinate is going to be the cosine of that angle, 

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,400
and the y coordinate, which is the imaginary part, 

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,900
is going to be i times the sine of that angle.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,743
So you might think, all throughout physics, all throughout electrical engineering, 

39
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:09,840
you see the expression cosine of theta plus i sine of theta.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,580
In fact, what you often see is another form of this.

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,620
Almost always, you see this written down as e to the power i times theta.

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,620
And this relationship is what's known as Euler's formula.

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,120
Now e is a special constant of nature, and I always remember in high school, 

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,640
it was never crystal clear to me exactly what it was.

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,660
It was something that was just kind of handed down, okay, it's 2.71828, on and on.

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,260
And we were just taking, you know, we were to take this as an analog of pi.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,620
It's an irrational number that evidently the universe finds significant.

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,883
I had one calculus teacher who would tell us it was the Andrew Jackson number, 

49
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,580
because the president, Andrew Jackson, served two terms.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,880
He was the seventh president, and he was elected in 1828.

51
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,520
So, there you go.

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,290
I don't know if Andrew Jackson appreciated this relationship that he had to Euler, 

53
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,120
but it always helped me remember the number.

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,429
Now, just to gauge sentiment, because I'm not entirely sure where the audience is, 

55
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:12,480
I want to know what your current relationship with this particular formula is.

56
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,520
So we're going to do a poll to start, and this poll is mostly going to be helpful to me.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,793
So, polling up some of the warm-up questions that we had, where evidently most of you, 

58
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:22,756
if you were to choose one of Euler's formulas, 

59
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:26,389
would have gone with the one that we're talking about today, which is great, you know, 

60
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,060
appropriate given where we want to head.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,066
As a poll that's actually going to be helpful to me, let me ask you, 

62
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:37,579
which of the following best describes your relationship with the formula 

63
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,340
e to the power i theta equals cosine of theta plus i times the sine of theta?

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:42,840
Okay?

65
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,656
And the options here are that you've never seen it before, totally understandable, 

66
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:50,100
that you've seen it but you're confused by it, 

67
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,428
that you still don't understand it but you've grown used to it, 

68
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:55,040
or that you understand it well.

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,400
So, as you can see, answers are rolling in.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,600
Please participate!

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,860
This is going to be way fun if more of you participate.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,656
You can go to 3b1b.co slash live, link is also in the description, 

73
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:08,040
that forwards you to the place where you can answer this poll.

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,459
And while answers are rolling in, I just want to remind us of a more famous variant of 

75
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,800
this expression that you often see, which is basically what happens when you plug in pi.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,400
So, if we say e to the i times pi, now we're thinking of pi as an angle, 

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,083
it's a number of radians, a distance around the unit circle, 

78
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:38,580
you would plug in cosine of pi plus i times the sine of pi.

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay?

80
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,087
And the way to think about that is to look at the unit circle and ask, 

81
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,620
what if you walked around until you'd walked a total distance of pi?

82
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,299
You know, if it's a lake with a radius 1 and you walk around the 

83
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:55,268
boundary until you've gone a distance of pi, kind of by the definition of what pi is, 

84
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:57,160
that takes you halfway around the circle.

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,424
So the x component, cosine, is going to be negative 1, and then the y component, 

86
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:06,980
sine, is actually 0, so there's no imaginary part, it's just negative 1.

87
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,380
And this gets us, you know, what might be the most celebrity equation in all of math, 

88
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,080
e to the i times pi is equal to negative 1.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,840
Okay?

90
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,387
But it's baffling, genuinely baffling, because you've got this 

91
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,987
idea of raising a constant, which is a little wishy-washy to start with, 

92
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:25,700
what is e, but you're raising it to an imaginary power.

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,019
And if you don't understand what that means, you're in good company, 

94
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,220
I think very few people in the world actually do.

95
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,857
Now turning back to our poll, where we've got a good number of responses, 

96
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:39,680
and a pretty good spread too, I'm genuinely curious to know, 

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,560
who am I talking to right now?

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:41,820
Okay?

99
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,860
Because it looks like we have a pretty even distribution among all camps.

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,201
Alright, so the number one most common answer is c, 

101
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:51,620
which is those who still don't understand it but they've grown used to it.

102
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,366
This, I'm going to guess, includes people like math majors or 

103
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:59,415
engineering majors or people who have gone into a technical field, 

104
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:02,800
where it comes up a lot, so you have to grow used to it.

105
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,759
This is also revealing the fact that even though these lectures are targeted 

106
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,965
at high school students, that this channel has a certain base demographic to start with, 

107
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:14,509
so sometimes those sitting in the audience, it's more like adults who have 

108
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,920
walked in and are sitting in the back of the class.

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,260
Very happy to see that d, I understand it well, is the second most common answer.

110
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,521
I'm curious among those who answer d, if by the end of the lecture they would 

111
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,400
say that what they understood about this is the same as what I'm going to teach.

112
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,601
Because for example, I would make the claim that this 

113
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:38,860
formula actually has nothing to do with the number e, okay?

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,299
That the number e doesn't actually play a role 

115
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,400
in what this formula is computationally saying.

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,339
And I'd be curious if those who claim that they 

117
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,400
understand it well would agree with that statement.

118
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,115
After that we have those who've seen it but are confused by it, 

119
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:55,300
and at the very end is the actual target demographic of those who've never seen it before.

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,658
Oh, I don't know if it's fair to call that the target demographic 

121
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,793
because I think sometimes you see it in an odd circumstance here or there, 

122
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:04,260
but definitely those who answered a or b, you're my people.

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,660
You're the ones that I want to talk to about this, okay?

124
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
But let's say you see this, okay?

125
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,331
You see this weird formula e to the pi i, or the 

126
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,640
generalization e to the i times some angle.

127
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,963
I think the healthy reaction to have to this, okay, 

128
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:24,580
if you're just seeing this for the first time, the healthy question to ask is w t f, okay?

129
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:32,400
What is the function at play and how is it defined, okay?

130
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,740
What's the function?

131
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,188
Because in this case the function is e to the x, 

132
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:39,940
and we're plugging in certain imaginary inputs.

133
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,740
And I think a lot of people think that that refers to taking a number e and multiplying 

134
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,228
by itself some number of times, and that x describes how often you're multiplying by 

135
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:51,680
itself.

136
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,319
And that yeah, there's some notion of extending that to things 

137
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,334
like one half or negative one, or any kind of real number, 

138
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:01,400
but that it's based in this idea of repeated multiplication.

139
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,940
Now the thing that makes this equation misleading is that that's not the function.

140
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,220
That is not what e to the x is referring to.

141
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,020
Let's emphasize that very heavily.

142
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,560
This is not what e to the x means.

143
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,820
This is not its convention.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,393
Instead, what has emerged in math is that we use 

145
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:23,060
e to the x to be a shorthand for another function.

146
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,400
A function which I'm going to give the name exp.

147
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,820
This is how you often see it in literature.

148
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,500
And it's defined to be a certain polynomial.

149
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,390
It's one plus x plus x squared divided by two plus x cubed 

150
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:45,000
divided by six plus x to the power four divided by twenty four.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,680
And in fact it's not a polynomial, it's an infinite polynomial.

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,260
We add infinitely many terms, each of which look like x to the n divided by n factorial.

153
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
The proper term for this is a series.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,067
In practice, if you're actually computing this, 

155
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,150
because that denominator grows so quickly, you can chop off 

156
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,160
the series pretty early to get an approximate value for what this actually is.

157
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,490
Now right away, we can see that this is going to 

158
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,400
work for lots of kinds of x that we could plug in.

159
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,636
Anything where we know how to raise x to a power, just a whole number power, 

160
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:21,625
multiply it by itself, and where we know how to divide by a factorial and add 

161
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,920
those together, we can come up with a nice meaning for what this exp function means.

162
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,658
But before we jump into things like complex numbers and throwing that in, 

163
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:35,652
I think it would be very unsatisfying to do that if we didn't first draw the connection 

164
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,560
to the number e.

165
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,520
And the idea of repeated multiplication.

166
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,087
Because on the surface, this infinite polynomial seems very different from 

167
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:47,280
the idea of some special constant of nature e and raising it to a power.

168
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,620
So let's build up a little familiarity.

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,800
We're going to take, you know, a couple minutes to do this.

170
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,285
And it's a very healthy exercise I think to become friends with 

171
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,460
this function by starting to plug in a couple different values.

172
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,740
One of the first you might plug in is the number 1.

173
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,340
So that way we get 1 and then x is 1, so that's 1.

174
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,920
x squared is still 1, so that's 1 half.

175
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
And then 1 sixth.

176
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,840
And then 1 twenty fourth.

177
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,640
And in general, we're adding 1 divided by n factorial.

178
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,265
In math we say that this is a series that converges in the 

179
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:28,102
sense that as we add more and more terms, it approaches a 

180
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:31,380
certain value and it gets closer and closer to some specific value.

181
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,360
And that value ends up being around 2.71828, the Andrew Jackson number.

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,560
But at this point, just think of it as it was going to be something.

183
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,180
x of 1 was going to be something.

184
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,180
This is what x of 1 happens to be.

185
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,500
At the moment, there isn't necessarily anything special about that.

186
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,280
But let's say you wanted to plug in other values.

187
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,888
Just to get a little practice with what that would look like, if I wanted x of 2, 

188
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:06,700
it would look like 1 plus 2 plus 2 squared over 2 plus 2 cubed over 6.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,652
And in principle, if you were on a desert island and you just needed to compute x of 2, 

190
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:15,380
you could work this all out by hand if you were comfortable with long division.

191
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,900
But of course, we live in the modern world.

192
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,800
We have computers, we have programming.

193
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,497
So I think to make this especially concrete, let's go ahead and actually implement 

194
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:28,820
this function so that we can calculate a couple values and so that it's not a black box.

195
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,960
It's not just a calculator that's been handed to us.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,660
We implement it so we know exactly what it's doing.

197
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,120
So for that, let's go ahead and pull up a little Python.

198
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,320
This is Desmos.

199
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,660
We might look at that a little bit later.

200
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,180
Right now, let's be a little bit more programmatic.

201
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,940
Let's pull up some Python.

202
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
Let's import some math because that's a sign you're always going to have some fun.

203
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,980
Then I'm going to define the exp function that's going to take in some number x.

204
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,723
And what I want is to return something that looks like 1 plus x plus x squared over 2, 

205
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:02,447
where in Python this double, what do you call it, an asterisk, 

206
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,640
this double asterisk sign is how we do exponentiation.

207
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,040
And then x cubed over 6.

208
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,160
And we kind of want to add that up a whole bunch.

209
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,709
Of course, instead of typing all that out, we can use a little special 

210
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:21,060
syntax where I'm going to say, I want you to return a sum of a bunch of terms.

211
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,965
Each term is going to look like raising x to some power, 

212
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,940
and it knows what x is because that's what was handed to it.

213
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,560
x to some power divided by the factorial.

214
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,560
Factorial of n.

215
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,700
And that's built into this math package that we imported.

216
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,620
And I'm just going to do this for values of n that start at 0.

217
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,440
0 factorial is defined to be 1, if you're curious.

218
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,433
We could talk all about factorials of weird values at a later date, 

219
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,520
but that's all you need to know here.

220
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,360
And I'm just going to have it range up to 100 because 100 factorial is going to be huge.

221
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,365
So that's going to be plenty big enough for a denominator to 

222
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:00,400
be small enough that those later terms don't contribute a lot.

223
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,187
So even if you don't know Python, I hope that this is a reasonably 

224
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:08,314
clear way to turn the math into something that our computer can chew on, 

225
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:11,480
and crunch through the numbers so that we don't have to.

226
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,680
So for example, if we type x of 1, we get the Andrew Jackson number.

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,080
2.71828, on and on.

228
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,780
And I could type in x of 2, and it looks like that's around 7.389.

229
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,000
So maybe we even write that in our notes.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,920
We go over here and say, interesting, x of 2 was about 7.389.

231
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,460
Okay.

232
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,145
And if you spend a long time just kind of playing around with this, okay, 

233
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:47,036
I think it's not obvious that you might find this, 

234
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:52,072
but if you were just plugging in a couple values, x of 3, x of 4, 

235
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:58,709
one important fact you might stumble across is that if I add two numbers in the input, 

236
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:04,050
okay, so in this case I get 1096 when I plug in 7, which is 3 plus 4, 

237
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,620
that actually ends up being the same as if I plug in x of 3 times x of 4.

238
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,420
Okay.

239
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,740
So adding the input corresponds to multiplying in the output.

240
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,735
And 3 and 4 weren't special here, I could have done, 

241
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:24,560
you know, 5.5 and 3.2, and that would have gotten me some value.

242
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,240
And if instead I had added those together, okay, it gets the same value.

243
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,260
That is not at all obvious, okay?

244
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,606
So I think that would be a genuine discovery to have with respect to this function, 

245
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:39,420
with this polynomial, if that was something that you found.

246
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,820
And it's important enough that I want to write it down.

247
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:56,380
Exp of a plus b is actually the same thing as exp of a times exp of b.

248
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,060
Now if you just look at the polynomial, this is not clear.

249
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,801
This is not something that, like, you look at it and say, 

250
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,060
oh yes, of course, it couldn't have been any other way.

251
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,823
At the end of today's lesson though, I'm going to give you guys some homework, 

252
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,740
and yes, homework will make you learn better.

253
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,462
And what we're going to do is go through a couple problems 

254
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:17,000
that are going to have you show that this fact is true.

255
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,211
That simply from the polynomial, and the fact that it includes these factorial terms, 

256
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:26,440
excuse me, that's going to be enough to show this very special property.

257
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,920
Now why am I calling it a very special property?

258
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,420
Well, I want to ask you a certain question that will hopefully make this clear.

259
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,100
And it really is important that you think this through yourself.

260
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,257
Because I think if we, uh, if I just kind of tell you the implications here, 

261
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:45,900
it's not going to sink in to the same extent as if you really noodle with it yourself.

262
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,887
So I'm going to pull up another question, and I'm 

263
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,560
going to give you some time to think on this one.

264
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,210
What the question asks us is to suppose that we have 

265
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,340
some function f of x that has this special property.

266
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,691
We're adding two numbers in the input, f of a plus b, 

267
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:07,160
gives the same result as multiplying in the output, f of a times f of b.

268
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,040
And that this is true for any real number, a and b.

269
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:10,580
Okay?

270
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,420
Suppose you have some function that satisfies this property, who cares how it's defined?

271
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,700
Whether it's through this polynomial, through other means.

272
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,800
Which of the following is true?

273
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,960
One of the options is that f of five is equal to f of one raised to the power five.

274
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,780
Another is that f of one half is equal to the square root of f of one.

275
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,760
And the other is f of negative one equals one divided by f of one.

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,788
Now very important, I'm not asking does there exist 

277
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,560
some function f where these three things will be true.

278
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm asking which of these necessarily has to be true only from that property.

279
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,888
So you shouldn't be able to contrive some sort 

280
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:48,880
of adversarial function that doesn't satisfy it.

281
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,180
And then you have various options for which collection of these three things is true.

282
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,384
I'm going to give you some time to think about 

283
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,760
this because I really do think it's important.

284
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,820
So I'm going to turn up our pause and ponder music to get us in the mood.

285
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,700
And take a desperately needed drink of water.

286
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,723
While you're noodling on that, I'm going to go 

287
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:28,280
ahead and take a question from the audience.

288
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,060
Where it looks like Serft asks, what do you think is more 

289
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,460
interesting to someone who is a newcomer to higher level math?

290
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,420
Special case theorems like e to the i pi or more general cases like e to the i x.

291
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,960
Oh that is such a great question.

292
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,970
By the way, anyone who wants to ask questions go 

293
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,880
to Twitter and just use the hashtag lockdown math.

294
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,300
Those will be forwarded to me.

295
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,056
I think the best way to learn is to have specific examples and really let yourself 

296
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:58,100
understand the patterns represented by those specific examples and then generalize them.

297
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,288
For the specific one that you have here, I think if you just see e to the i pi, 

298
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:08,340
that doesn't really count as a good specific example that explains the generality.

299
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,680
It's more that you're plugging in one particular number into a formula.

300
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,046
So in this case e to the i x, as you'll see, it has everything 

301
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:19,787
to do with circular motion and between this lecture and the next one, 

302
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:22,940
we're going to talk about why that relation might be there.

303
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,902
So the form of having specific examples that aids your understanding wouldn't be, 

304
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:30,100
you know, a number like e to the i pi.

305
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,533
It would be building a relationship with circular motions and other 

306
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:36,813
circumstances like studying physics where you have a tetherball with 

307
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:40,380
some kind of centripetal force and it's orbiting or like orbital mechanics.

308
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,106
Anything where you're really understanding the nature of circular motion, 

309
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:48,286
that actually prepares you for understanding e to the i x as a generality a little 

310
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:48,840
bit better.

311
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,740
So with all of that, answers are still rolling in and I don't want you to feel rushed.

312
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,340
So I'm going to give a little bit more time here actually.

313
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,997
Because remember, you need to really be sure that if you're saying 

314
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:09,235
that something like 2 or 3 or 1 is included in your answer that 

315
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:13,540
any function with this special property necessarily follows that.

316
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:23,880
Oh, let's see if we can grade it when the top answer is the year.

317
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,260
So 2017, that's a little bit in the past.

318
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,940
2013, we're losing the top answer.

319
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,920
Interesting, people are changing their mind.

320
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,340
It's like we're going back in time.

321
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,440
So it looks like a couple people are, oh now we're in the future, 2023.

322
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,589
Yeah, so we're actually seeing people think about it and thinking, 

323
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:44,000
hang on, you know, is it the case that option 3 here is necessarily true?

324
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
And they're really being critical about that.

325
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,200
So that's a good sign.

326
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
If you want to keep thinking about it, please do.

327
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,903
But for the sake of continuing with the lesson, 

328
00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:02,180
I'm going to go ahead and lock things in here and see how people ended up answering.

329
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,997
So it looks like 2030 of you, the decade in the future, 

330
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,080
believe that all three of these are necessarily true.

331
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,240
So, second most common answer was B, they only believe that the first one is true.

332
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,280
And then after that, people who either included number 2 or number 3.

333
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,560
And the correct answer is that all of them are.

334
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,000
And it's very interesting to walk through why.

335
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,360
I do think it's very elucidating.

336
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,940
So let's go ahead and do this.

337
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,215
The first one, which it seems like a majority of you believe, 

338
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:37,802
is that if we plug in something like 5 to a function with this special property, 

339
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:41,940
that it'll be the same as taking f of 1 raised to the fifth.

340
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:50,180
Now the reason is that we could also write 5 as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

341
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,616
And this property of addition in the input becoming multiplication in the output 

342
00:20:56,616 --> 00:21:01,780
means that's the same thing as writing x of 1 multiplied by itself 5 times.

343
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,520
Okay?

344
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,980
It lets you rewrite the whole thing in terms of x of 1, which I'm going to say 5 times.

345
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,300
This is the same as taking x of 1 raised to the power 5.

346
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,948
And here when I'm writing exponentials, anytime you see a natural number or a 

347
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,340
whole number, it can literally mean multiplying by itself that number of times.

348
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,860
That's not the same as the fact that e to the x is a shorthand for this crazy polynomial.

349
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,460
So that can sometimes get a little confusing, the exponent is playing two different roles.

350
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,340
And we might give x of 1 a special name, a shorthand.

351
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
Let's just call it e for short.

352
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,160
That's not why we call this number e, by the way.

353
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,320
It's also not because this is what Euler's name starts with.

354
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,917
It's just because whenever Euler was using this, the first time in a particular book, 

355
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:52,080
he was partial to vowels and the vowel a had already been used.

356
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,800
So e was just his arbitrary letter.

357
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,013
Okay, so simply by virtue of this property, we can 

358
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:01,020
see that x of 5 has to be written in terms of x of 1.

359
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,240
Now a little bit trickier was the question about plugging in 1 half.

360
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,380
Okay?

361
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,935
And the key to solving this, it's a little bit tricky, 

362
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:13,320
is to think about what happens when we multiply that by itself.

363
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,890
x of 1 half times x of 1 half, because of this property, has to satisfy, 

364
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,780
or I should say has to equal, x of 1 half plus x of 1 half.

365
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,080
Which is of course x of 1, which let's say we're using the shorthand and we call it e.

366
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,680
So what does that mean?

367
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,940
x of 1 half has to be a number such that multiplying it by itself equals e.

368
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,940
Well that's what we mean when we write square roots.

369
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:41,940
Okay?

370
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,600
And the last one was talking about negative inputs.

371
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,200
So just as an example, if we inputted something like negative 1.

372
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:57,460
So the key here is to ask about multiplying it by the value when you plug in 1.

373
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,798
By this rule, that addition in the input turns into multiplication in the output, 

374
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,380
that has to be the same as exp of 0.

375
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,620
Now what is exp of 0?

376
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,520
Ooh, you know what I'm realizing.

377
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,340
Hmm.

378
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,540
I think I might have actually made the, entered a wrong answer there.

379
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Because in our case, in our case exp of 0 actually does come out to be the number 1.

380
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,474
Okay, so if we plug in 0 for x, then all of these, 

381
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,920
you add them together, the only term that matters is 1.

382
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,080
So exp of negative 1 times exp of 1 is equal to exp of 0, which is 1.

383
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,320
So this is true in the case of exp.

384
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,380
I, I can't actually think to myself right now if that's necessarily true.

385
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,961
You know, if we look at our question, where it's saying all 

386
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,380
we know about f is that f of a plus b is f of a times f of b.

387
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,580
If that necessarily implies that f of 0 is going to be 1.

388
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,240
And I, I don't think it does.

389
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,640
I think we could construct a function.

390
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,180
Yeah, because we could just scale e to the x by some other amount.

391
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,560
Okay, yeah, so actually what's graded here is not entirely correct.

392
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,920
The correct answer would be only 1 and 2.

393
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,480
I think.

394
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,080
Someone correct me on Twitter if I'm wrong about that.

395
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,420
But, very interesting.

396
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:23,020
So if we go back to our paper, let's see.

397
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,720
In the case of exp, this, this value at 0 would be 1.

398
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,540
What does that imply?

399
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,130
Well, if we call exp of 1 e, that means we're asking 

400
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,540
what is the number which when you multiply by e equals 1.

401
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,500
And it would be 1 divided by e.

402
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,830
But yeah, for the general case, we need the added 

403
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,360
condition that when you plug in 0 you do get 1.

404
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,393
Now the point of all of this, right, the reason that I'm saying this, 

405
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:51,700
is to emphasize why it's reasonable that we use the shorthand.

406
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,013
That when we say exp of x, for real numbers x, 

407
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:59,020
why it would be very reasonable to write this as e to the power x.

408
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,181
Because basically this special property means that because 

409
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:06,742
you can use the number 1 to access pretty much all the real 

410
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:10,600
numbers by adding it to itself or dividing as needed or negating.

411
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:13,975
And then if you have certain continuity restrictions that 

412
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:16,860
will let you extend from rational numbers to all the reals.

413
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,500
But that's a technical point, you don't need to fuss over for what we're doing right now.

414
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,808
It lets you basically express everything that this polynomial 

415
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,620
can output in terms of what it outputs at the number 1.

416
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,938
So you might read e to the x as just, whatever this polynomial is at the input 1, 

417
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:37,660
we can start exponentiating in terms of that.

418
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,925
So that's the connection, right, we could, we could if we wanted define 

419
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:45,300
the number e to simply be where is this polynomial at the number 1.

420
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,160
And then all of this would follow.

421
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,860
But I really want to emphasize that only makes sense for real numbers.

422
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,272
Because as soon as we start introducing things like complex numbers, 

423
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:57,720
you can't just add 1 to itself or subtract and divide and get the number i.

424
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,609
And in math you often do even crazier things where 

425
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:03,160
you plug in things like matrices into this polynomial.

426
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,977
Which seems weird, but you know, you can take a matrix and square it, 

427
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:10,140
you can divide it by 2, you can add all of those together.

428
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,240
And that's actually a very useful thing.

429
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,332
It's very useful for a field called differential equations, 

430
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:17,080
which in turn is useful for physics.

431
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,900
In quantum mechanics you often plug in these things called operators, 

432
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,140
which are kind of like the mature older brother of matrices.

433
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,079
And all of that looks totally nonsensical if we're 

434
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,980
talking about a constant raised to some kind of power.

435
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,440
But what you have to understand is that it's being plugged into this polynomial.

436
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,600
So I understand why we have the convention of writing this as e to the x.

437
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,380
It makes sense for real numbers.

438
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,240
But I think that's actually a bad convention as soon as we start extending it.

439
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,380
And I think that causes a lot of undue confusion.

440
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,180
So with all of that said, let's finally have some fun and plug in some complex values.

441
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,274
And before we do that, just as kind of a warm up, 

442
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:58,860
I want to make sure that we're comfortable with powers of i.

443
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,720
Because that's what's going to be important here.

444
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,640
So let's pull up our quiz and let's go ahead and ask one more question.

445
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,940
And then I'll take a question from the audience too while you guys think about this.

446
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,720
Remember that i is defined to be a value that satisfies i squared equals negative one.

447
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,220
So that's defined.

448
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,020
For which values of n does i to the power n equal negative i?

449
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:29,580
So the spirit of this question is to have people thinking deeply about powers of i.

450
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,020
And I wanted it to be a question that's not totally obvious.

451
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,200
So one that you do have to put a little mental energy into.

452
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,620
So let's go ahead and take a question from the audience while I take a drink of water.

453
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:54,060
F of x equals zero doesn't work with f of negative one equals one over f of one.

454
00:27:57,739 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah, f of x equals zero.

455
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,540
Oh, interesting.

456
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,120
Yeah, okay.

457
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,500
So they're saying that if f of x ever outputs zero.

458
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,220
Actually, I'm not entirely sure what Sam is saying.

459
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,380
F of x equals zero doesn't work with f of negative one equals one over f of one.

460
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,945
So I guess that fact that f of negative one is one over 

461
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:24,840
f of one doesn't imply that the output will ever be zero.

462
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,060
So I could ask for some clarification, but I think that might 

463
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,720
be getting at the general point of the mistake of the question.

464
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,340
Which was to assume, to extend the idea of exp a little bit too much.

465
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,940
Where the fact that exp of zero equals one gives us this other property.

466
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,440
And then Crispin Simmons says three is included because f of x plus zero.

467
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,140
Oh, okay.

468
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,640
Yeah, okay.

469
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Great.

470
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,540
Great.

471
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,400
Yeah, someone thought this through a little bit more deeply 

472
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,020
than I can while live and on camera and under some pressure.

473
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,840
F of x plus zero is the same as f of x times f of zero, which implies f of x equals one.

474
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,480
Awesome.

475
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
Crispin, you saved me.

476
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,820
You saved me on this one.

477
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,000
That's a beautiful way of thinking about it.

478
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,980
Yeah, all of these questions where you have like a 

479
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,180
property of a function and you're supposed to deduce facts.

480
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,540
They can be very subtle.

481
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
And so in this case, okay, the question was graded correctly.

482
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,053
The property simply that addition in the input becomes multiplication in the output is 

483
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:26,978
enough to imply f of zero equals one, which in turn locks in the value for f of negative 

484
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:27,200
one.

485
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,180
Oh, it's so pleasing.

486
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,827
One little property can just lock in basic, not the whole real number line 

487
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:35,600
because it didn't assume continuity, but it locks in pretty much any value you want.

488
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,520
Awesome.

489
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,560
Excellent questions.

490
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,780
I love live stuff.

491
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,040
Even if I make errors, it does feel a little more interactive than the usual videos.

492
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,140
So let's see how we're doing on the quiz.

493
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,740
Looks like we've still got some answers rolling in.

494
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,400
We're trying to understand which powers of i are equal to negative i.

495
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,993
And the options include multiples of three or multiples of three 

496
00:29:58,993 --> 00:30:02,827
as long as they're positive, or integers one below a multiple of 

497
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:06,720
four or those where you're restricted to them just being positive.

498
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,740
And I'm going to go ahead and grade this question.

499
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,395
And as always, if you feel like you weren't done by the time I'm locking it in, 

500
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:18,740
know that that's just for the sake of letting the lesson progress forward.

501
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,697
If you wanted to pause and think about it further yourself, 

502
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:25,542
especially if you're watching this later, that would be totally in the spirit 

503
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,380
of these lessons.

504
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,520
Okay.

505
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,650
So the majority, or the plurality, I guess, of you answered that 

506
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,540
it's all integers one below a multiple of four, which is correct.

507
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,080
And the second most common answer was basically the same but restricted to positives.

508
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,600
Great.

509
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,886
So let's think through what powers of i actually look like, 

510
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:51,152
because this is going to be the only thing we really need to plug in complex values 

511
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:52,320
into this exp function.

512
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,873
And the way this can work, if I pull out my infinite supply of unit circles, 

513
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:03,340
is to remember that multiplication in the complex plane includes a rotation component.

514
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,980
And because i has a magnitude of one, there's only rotation.

515
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,880
So multiplying by i has the effect of rotating 90 degrees.

516
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,700
If you multiply by i twice, okay, i squared, you end up 180 degrees around.

517
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,795
Reassuring, it's supposed to have a square of negative one, 

518
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,640
and this geometry lines up with that fact.

519
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,025
If we multiply by itself three times to get i cubed, 

520
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:30,600
it ends up being a vector pointing straight down.

521
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,740
Multiplying by itself a fourth time, 90 degrees, takes us back to one.

522
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,040
So i to the fourth is one, and then after that they all start repeating.

523
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,048
So basically all you need to know is where is 

524
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:46,580
that exponent with respect to powers of four.

525
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,480
If it's a power of four, you're at one.

526
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,440
If it's one above a power of four, you're at i.

527
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,263
Now the trickiness of the question was to also include the nuance 

528
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:58,340
of whether this is only for positive powers or negative powers.

529
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,405
But what a negative power means, if we write something like i to the negative one, 

530
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:08,227
that's defined to be one over i, the number such that when you multiply by it, 

531
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:08,960
you get one.

532
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,320
And you can see that that's actually the same as i cubed.

533
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,716
This is the same as i cubed because that's a number where when we multiply it by i, 

534
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:19,400
we get one.

535
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,960
Negative one, that's also one below a multiple of four.

536
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,574
And in general, anything that's one below all the 

537
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:28,660
negative multiples of four will also satisfy this property.

538
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,571
So it's a little tricky question, but it's just because I wanted you to think deeply 

539
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:36,159
about this idea that powers of i, of whole numbers, 

540
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,300
just have us ticking forward by 90 degrees.

541
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,380
And finally, we can have our fun.

542
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,071
We can take our crazy exp function, and we could plug it 

543
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:49,580
into Python if we wanted to and see how things play there.

544
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,120
But first, let me go ahead and visualize it for you.

545
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,233
So I'm going to, uh, let's see, that circle is already suggestively drawn, 

546
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:59,080
but I don't want that to be there.

547
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,200
I just want you to think about this polynomial where I'm going to plug in i scaled 

548
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,160
by some kind of constant, which very suggestively I'm going to give the name theta.

549
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,982
And then what that means is taking one plus i times theta plus i theta squared over two, 

550
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:13,580
on and on.

551
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,280
And just as an example, let's crank theta on up until it equals one.

552
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,980
And let's try to think pretty deeply about what this actually means computationally.

553
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,472
The first term is one, which we might draw with this green vector on the bottom, 

554
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:27,900
pointed one unit to the right.

555
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,720
The next term is going to be i times one, so just i.

556
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,620
It's pointed straight up with magnitude one.

557
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,200
Now think about what the next term is.

558
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,558
It's going to be i squared, or i theta squared, but theta is one, 

559
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,300
so it's i squared, which is negative one over two.

560
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,240
So that's why this next vector is pointed to the left, and it has length one half.

561
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,180
Okay?

562
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,480
Then after that, i cubed is pointed straight down, and we divide it by six.

563
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,608
So now we just have an itty bitty vector that is of magnitude one sixth, 

564
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:02,800
and then they just get smaller from there.

565
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,087
The next one is pointed to the right, but it has magnitude one over twenty four, 

566
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,500
and they just shrink a whole bunch.

567
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,600
And so we get something.

568
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,719
It's clear that this is a computation that makes sense to do.

569
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,600
It's not clear how we would know where it ends up.

570
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,920
That feels like it's going to require real math to have some kind of theory behind it.

571
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,653
We could be computational, and pull up Python, 

572
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:26,360
and remember that it actually has built-in support for complex numbers.

573
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,875
If I write something like complex of two three, 

574
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:32,505
it gives me a complex number with real part two and imaginary part three, 

575
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:35,940
and what's cool is that it already knows the rules for multiplication.

576
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,380
So I could multiply this by other things, it knows how to take their product, very cool.

577
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,992
Now given that our definition of this exponential function, if you'll remember, 

578
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:49,949
was only ever in terms of raising something to a power and scaling it by a factorial, 

579
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:54,734
and then adding all those terms up, well it should make sense to plug in something 

580
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:59,520
like complex zero one, which is how we write i in Python, and see what it pops out.

581
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,165
And indeed, it crunches through the numbers, and it gets for us 

582
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:06,660
something whose real part is evidently around point five four, who knew?

583
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,077
And whose imaginary part is around point eight four, 

584
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:13,560
and in terms of our visual, you know, that checks out.

585
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,661
It looks like the real part is a little above point five, 

586
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:18,460
so point five four, I believe that.

587
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,140
And the imaginary part is, it claimed what, point eight four?

588
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,740
Yeah, that seems about right.

589
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,500
So at this point, we can actually think, what is the claim of Euler's formula?

590
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,340
What is it telling us about the behavior here?

591
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,789
And my hope is that Euler's formula might have started off mysterious, 

592
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,920
but mysterious in a bad way, okay?

593
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,798
Because when you initially see this expression, 

594
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:46,339
e to the i theta is equal to cosine theta plus i sine theta, telling you that, 

595
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:49,730
oh, I guess imaginary exponents get us on the unit circle, 

596
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,776
it doesn't leave you wondering about a real pattern, 

597
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,880
it leaves you wondering what the convention is, right?

598
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,740
It leaves you wondering, WTF.

599
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,924
However, right now what we can see is what this is saying is if I plug in i times theta, 

600
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:07,460
evidently that's the same as walking around a unit circle.

601
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:13,373
Now that feels very substantive, there's a lot of content to be had in that expression, 

602
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:17,601
because if we go to our visual, what it's telling us is that if I, 

603
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:21,956
if I crank up this value of theta, the place that the sum of vectors 

604
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:25,680
converges always sits on a circle that's one of radius one.

605
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
That's not obvious.

606
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,321
If you just look at this expression and you think through what it's saying 

607
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,460
very literally, that is definitely not something that just pops right out of it.

608
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,360
But it becomes a lot more beautiful, in my opinion, 

609
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,166
because you're no longer asking questions of convention, 

610
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,120
you're asking questions of the universe, of actual patterns.

611
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,933
So just to take the most famous input that there is, 

612
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:50,340
plugging in pi around 3.14, let's think about what this is actually saying.

613
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,975
It's saying, okay, the first term is one, so we've 

614
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:55,300
got our vector pointed one unit to the right.

615
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,040
The next term is i times pi.

616
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,478
Okay, so that's going to be a vector that's pointed up because of 

617
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:06,140
the i with a length of pi around 3.14, which it looks like it is.

618
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,540
The next one is going to be i squared times pi squared over two.

619
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,660
So that i squared means that it's negative, okay, it's pointing to the left.

620
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,320
And I guess the magnitude is pi squared over two.

621
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,391
We could do a quick gut check if we wanted and just ask ourselves, 

622
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:22,860
you know, what is pi squared?

623
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:28,249
It's around 9.8, same as the gravity on Earth in terms of meters per second squared, 

624
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:29,480
which is always fun.

625
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,260
And dividing that by two, it looks like it's 4.93.

626
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,940
Okay, does that check out?

627
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,200
Yeah, I buy it that the length of this vector is just less than five, so 4.93.

628
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:44,380
And then the next one, because of the i cubed, 

629
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,400
is pointed down and the magnitude is pi cubed over six.

630
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,420
Evidently that's around the magnitude of pi cubed over six.

631
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,504
And so far the vectors have been getting bigger, 

632
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:58,472
but it's at this point they start turning around because basically each time on the, 

633
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:01,980
for each new term, the numerator gets an extra pi thrown in.

634
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,940
But the denominator now gets an extra four thrown in.

635
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,480
Like going from six to 24, you're multiplying by a four.

636
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,240
And then it's going to get an extra five and then a six.

637
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,064
So the denominator is going to start growing much more than the numerator, 

638
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:17,940
which is why the vectors shrink and shrink and start to converge to a point.

639
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,454
So the i in there is what's letting these vectors all turn 

640
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:24,220
90 degrees each time and give us this very pretty spiral sum.

641
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,374
And the claim of Euler's formula is this very fascinating fact, 

642
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:32,695
that evidently when the vectors are rotating according to powers of i, 

643
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:37,929
and when their lengths are changing according to powers of pi divided by n factorial, 

644
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:42,920
they all conspire in just the right way, that they land at the point negative one.

645
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,460
That's interesting.

646
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,500
Still mysterious, but mysterious in a good way.

647
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,064
And it's making an even stronger claim, which is that any other 

648
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:56,620
angle that we might put in, it puts us on a unit circle at that angle.

649
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,683
Now this is especially mysterious when we consider the fact that as we let this value 

650
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:07,820
just continue increasing, it's not even clear that the function would be periodic, right?

651
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,394
Because as theta increases, more and more of the vectors become relevant, 

652
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:16,929
because it takes longer and longer for the denominator of our terms to win out, 

653
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:20,500
and yet they stay very nicely constrained onto the unit circle.

654
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,180
I think that's interesting.

655
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,942
So just to do a last little concept check here, 

656
00:39:25,942 --> 00:39:31,047
I'm going to ask you one final question to basically see if you've been paying attention, 

657
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,260
see if the claims made stand to reason.

658
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,669
So getting rid of our powers of i, the last question 

659
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,080
is a wind-down question of sorts for the evening.

660
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,580
Which of the following values is closest to e to the 3i?

661
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,040
So as usual, this is the link you can go to.

662
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,980
Which of the following values is closest to e to the 3i?

663
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,578
Now as you're answering, let me just remind you that the main takeaway 

664
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:28,294
I want you to have from this lesson is that the way that you read 

665
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:32,180
this is not to think about a constant e raised to an imaginary power.

666
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,327
Because that doesn't really make sense when we're 

667
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:37,560
thinking of powers as repeated multiplication.

668
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,760
However, what does...

669
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,640
Let's see...

670
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,700
Seems like we have some controversy over the last question.

671
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,880
We'll address that in a moment.

672
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,930
But what you should think about here is the fact that e 

673
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,700
to the x is shorthand for this general polynomial, okay?

674
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,800
And this general polynomial, it turns out to be very 

675
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,480
relevant in things like calculus in a future lecture.

676
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,552
I'd like to start talking about why this idea of 

677
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:08,480
x to the n over n factorial and adding them up.

678
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,420
Why is that useful?

679
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,520
Why would anyone care?

680
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,000
Why would it give rotation?

681
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,380
But if you know that that's how to read it, hopefully this isn't a nonsense question.

682
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,920
And it's not one that just asks you to blindly believe convention.

683
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,944
It kind of asks you to blindly believe a claim about the fact that this follows a circle, 

684
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,800
but we'll address that in the next lecture.

685
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,020
And I think that's enough time to go ahead and grade this.

686
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,620
And the correct answer is b, which around 3800 of you nicely got.

687
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,120
Well done, well done indeed.

688
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,380
And it's around negative 0.99 plus 0.14i.

689
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,560
So the expectation isn't that you're a machine who can calculate that in your head.

690
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,193
It's instead the idea that if we go over to our visual, 

691
00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:55,774
where we're plugging in values of theta, and you ask what happens when you plug in 3, 

692
00:41:55,774 --> 00:42:01,160
that the claim of Euler's formula is that we walk three units around a unit circle.

693
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,429
Knowing that pi units takes us all the way around, 

694
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:09,031
three units should take us so that the real part is really quite close to negative 1, 

695
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:11,440
and the imaginary part is something positive.

696
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,420
And of the options you were given, those were the only ones in there.

697
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,123
Now the very last thing that I would like to emphasize here is that 

698
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:23,180
nothing about this actual expression has to do with the number E.

699
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,520
Has to do with the number 2.71828, on and on.

700
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,567
If we were to go to the computation taking place, 

701
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,695
if I plug in something like exp of a complex number whose real part is 0 

702
00:42:33,695 --> 00:42:37,710
and whose imaginary part is pi, which at first it might look like it's 

703
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,743
outputting something other than negative 1, but it's saying the real part is negative 1, 

704
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:47,040
and then some numerical error because, partly because of how we defined it, 

705
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,225
you know, only doing so many terms, and partly because computers can't do 

706
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:52,300
infinite precision.

707
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,161
The imaginary part, it might look like it's saying 3.45, 

708
00:42:56,161 --> 00:43:00,540
but really it's saying times 10 to the negative 16th, that's what that means.

709
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,840
So it's basically 0.

710
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:09,520
If you wanted to see this we could maybe import numpy and do something like round it.

711
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,272
So I can round this thing to, I don't know, 8 decimal places, 

712
00:43:13,272 --> 00:43:16,080
and we see that, okay, it's basically negative 1.

713
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,220
So this is the function that we wrote, showing us that e to the pi i is negative 1.

714
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,259
But what I'd like to emphasize is that nowhere 

715
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:27,160
in that function did we include the value 2.718.

716
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,068
In fact, nowhere in the computer's memory during the execution 

717
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:34,480
of this computation would it encounter the value 2.718.

718
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,411
I would submit to you that that value is not relevant to the equation 

719
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:43,220
e to the pi i equals negative 1, which is kind of funny, right?

720
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,064
Let's at least write out what the relationship is, because, you know, 

721
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:53,611
I'm not going to say there's no connection between e and pi, there is one, 

722
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:58,218
but I think when you write the very famous celebrity equation e to the pi i 

723
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:02,948
equals negative 1, it heavily overstates the connection that there is between 

724
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:04,100
this e and that pi.

725
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:10,328
What's really going on is that we have this function exp that we've defined, 

726
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:15,726
and that when you plug in real values, okay, when you plug in real numbers, 

727
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:20,982
for the reasons we talked about earlier, it makes sense to write exp of x 

728
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:26,380
in terms of whatever its value at 1 happens to be, exp of 1 raised to the x.

729
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,460
And that we often call that value exp of 1 e, okay?

730
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
This is a property of the function.

731
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:39,182
Another fact about this is that when we plug in imaginary numbers, 

732
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:43,825
the claim of Euler's formula, which I haven't shown why it's true, 

733
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:48,260
but the claim that it's making is that it's periodic, basically.

734
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,940
That it walks around a circle, and it's periodic with a period of 2 pi i.

735
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,097
Basically when you increase that input by 2 pi i, you get back to where you started, 

736
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:06,040
and even more specifically that you do so by walking along a circle.

737
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,380
So it's saying that each of these constants is a child of the function exp of x, right?

738
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,380
But the way that they're related kind of happens along different dimensions.

739
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,960
That I think is the healthy way to understand this formula.

740
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,337
Now in the next lecture, we are going to be talking 

741
00:45:22,337 --> 00:45:25,260
about why this thing walks around in circles.

742
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,581
And that necessarily involves a little bit of calculus, 

743
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:35,240
so we're going to get a little bit of calculus into the mix here, but as minimal as I can.

744
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,420
And before then, I want to leave you with some homework.

745
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,502
Because if you remember, the core property that related this 

746
00:45:42,502 --> 00:45:45,968
strange polynomial with factorials to the number e was that 

747
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:49,780
addition in the input is the same as multiplication in the output.

748
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,205
So before next time, I won't grade this, this is just, 

749
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:59,220
you know, to do on your own time in your own way.

750
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,362
Question number 1, I want you to show that when you fully expand exp of x times exp of y, 

751
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:10,026
and you know, you might have written down for yourself what this function is, 

752
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:11,940
it's all those factorial things.

753
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,160
Show that when you expand that out, each term has the form x to the k times y 

754
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,840
to the m divided by k factorial m factorial for certain whole numbers k and m.

755
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,580
And remember, 0 factorial is defined to be 1.

756
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,300
Question number 2, show that when you expand exp of x plus y, 

757
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,815
so addition in the input, each term is going to look like 1 over 

758
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:44,840
n factorial times n choose k times x to the k times y to the n minus k.

759
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,402
If you're not familiar with this term n choose k, 

760
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:50,195
take a look at the binomial formula, I'm sure there's plenty of 

761
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:54,080
excellent videos on YouTube about it, I'll leave links in the description as I find them.

762
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,020
But show that that's true.

763
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,220
Question 3, compare the two results that you just found to explain this key property.

764
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,755
The thing that relates this function to some special 

765
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:08,060
constant and the idea of raising it to powers.

766
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,698
And then if you're up for the bonus question, this is kind of the, 

767
00:47:12,698 --> 00:47:15,937
this is for all of the extra credit in the world, justify, 

768
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:20,440
see if you can say, will this result still be true if x and y are complex numbers?

769
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,160
And will it still be true if they're matrices?

770
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,116
That actually I think is a very important exercise to go 

771
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:30,580
through to understand when this is true for what kinds of inputs.

772
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,972
Because like I said, as you get deeper and deeper into math, 

773
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:38,153
this exp function remains very relevant and you start plugging in things that seem 

774
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:39,060
wilder and wilder.

775
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,980
It's useful, it is genuinely useful, and it's important 

776
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,780
to know what properties carry over and which ones don't.

777
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,310
Now, I was talking a little about this lecture with a friend beforehand, 

778
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,400
and I mentioned the spirit of the lockdown math series being like high school classes.

779
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,505
And you know, he looks at me quizzically and he's like, 

780
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:58,320
is this, is that a high school topic?

781
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,480
And the honest answer is I don't know.

782
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,683
What I can say is that it is the case that in high school, 

783
00:48:04,683 --> 00:48:07,400
we came across the formula e to the i theta.

784
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,881
I think the first time that I ever saw it, it was in, 

785
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:11,660
you know, learning about complex numbers.

786
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,781
It was just taught as the polar representation of complex numbers to emphasize this idea 

787
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:21,960
that when you multiply two things, you multiply their magnitudes and you add their angles.

788
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,020
But it was just this strange thing handed from on high.

789
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,907
The usual way that we teach a relationship between e to the x in 

790
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,660
this polynomial comes from a piece of calculus called Taylor series.

791
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,228
And you start with the function e to the x, always defined in a little 

792
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:39,600
bit of a wishy-washy way, depending on the course that you're taking.

793
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,240
And then you show that it's connected to this polynomial.

794
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
But I think there's no reason we can't go the other way around.

795
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,960
And I actually wish that I had seen this.

796
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,390
I wish that I had known from the beginning that through math, 

797
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:54,474
especially through deeper math, that this is what the expression e to the x 

798
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,280
actually means.

799
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,347
So with that, I'm going to call an end to the proper lecture and just 

800
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:03,560
take a couple more questions from the audience to finish things off.

801
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,120
Maintain the interactivity that is the spirit of our lectures.

802
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,500
All right.

803
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,380
Great, great.

804
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,280
We have more discussion.

805
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,140
I love this.

806
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,760
Crispin's proof is wrong.

807
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,300
The constant function f of x equals zero.

808
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,120
Ah, wonderful.

809
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,600
Excellent counter example.

810
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,720
I think this was maybe niggling in the back of my mind.

811
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,200
It's like, I don't think this is unique.

812
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,040
Great.

813
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,200
So you have the case of a function that is constantly equal to zero.

814
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,223
And I think whoever was asking a question earlier that I didn't quite understand, 

815
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:34,020
I think this must be what you were getting at.

816
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,520
And I didn't.

817
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,140
I just wasn't reading it properly.

818
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,600
But yeah, that would be a function where f of zero is not necessarily one.

819
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,180
Beautiful.

820
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:42,920
All right.

821
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,570
So that question that I said was wrong and then I said it wasn't wrong, 

822
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,380
it actually was wrong.

823
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,320
So thank you very much, Eric Moss.

824
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,500
And to everyone who can think more clearly about things than I can while live on camera.

825
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,600
And then another person points out exactly the same thing.

826
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,780
I love this.

827
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,180
This is just like a real class.

828
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:00,520
I'm up here.

829
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,440
I get to make mistakes.

830
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,080
You're down there.

831
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,080
You get to correct them.

832
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,160
And I think it makes it better for everyone watching.

833
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,040
There's a legitimate discussion to be had.

834
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,200
What's relevant in the case of the exp function is just that it's not constantly zero.

835
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,600
That it does, in fact, equal one at the input x equals zero.

836
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,240
But I love this discussion.

837
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,340
And I think I can imagine no better place to end things than right there.

838
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,660
So as always, thank you for joining.

839
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,050
I hope this helped provide a little bit of a different perspective than what you usually 

840
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,454
see in other classes on what's a very popular topic on the Internet, 

841
00:50:32,454 --> 00:50:33,540
at least as math goes.

842
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,920
And next time we're going to talk about why it's true, where the circle would come from.

843
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,160
I hope to see you then.

844
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:39,160
.
