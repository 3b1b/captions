  1227.94

 [
  "The first one, which it seems like a majority of you believe, is that if we plug in something like 5 to a function with this special property, that it'll be the same as taking f of 1 raised to the fifth.",

  1241.94

  1250.18

  1261.78
 ],
 [
  "Okay?",
  1262.92,
  1263.52

  "It lets you rewrite the whole thing in terms of x of 1, which I'm going to say 5 times.",
  1264.34,
  1269.98
 ],
 [
  "This is the same as taking x of 1 raised to the power 5.",
  1272.36,
  1277.3
 ],
 [
  "And here when I'm writing exponentials, anytime you see a natural number or a whole number, it can literally mean multiplying by itself that number of times.",
  1277.6,
  1284.34
 ],
 [
  "That's not the same as the fact that e to the x is a shorthand for this crazy polynomial.",
  1284.5,
  1288.86
 ],
 [
  "So that can sometimes get a little confusing, the exponent is playing two different roles.",
  1289.34,
  1292.46
 ],

  "And we might give x of 1 a special name, a shorthand.",
  1292.92,
  1296.34
 ],
 [
  "Let's just call it e for short.",
  1296.64,
  1298.32
 ],
 [
  "That's not why we call this number e, by the way.",
  1298.78,
  1301.16
 ],
 [
  "It's also not because this is what Euler's name starts with.",
  1301.4,
  1304.32
 ],
 [
  "It's just because whenever Euler was using this, the first time in a particular book, he was partial to vowels and the vowel a had already been used.",

  "So e was just his arbitrary letter.",
  1312.1,
  1313.8

  1315.12,
  1321.02
 ],
 [
  "Now a little bit trickier was the question about plugging in 1 half.",
  1321.02,
  1325.24
 ],
 [
  "Okay?",
  1326.22,
  1326.38
 ],
 [
  "And the key to solving this, it's a little bit tricky, is to think about what happens when we multiply that by itself.",
  1326.98,
  1333.32
 ],
 [
  "x of 1 half times x of 1 half, because of this property, has to satisfy, or I should say has to equal, x of 1 half plus x of 1 half.",
  1333.84,
  1344.78

  "Which is of course x of 1, which let's say we're using the shorthand and we call it e.",
  1345.02,
  1351.08
 ],
 [
  "So what does that mean?",
  1351.92,
  1352.68
 ],
 [
  "x of 1 half has to be a number such that multiplying it by itself equals e.",
  1353.06,
  1357.94
 ],
 [
  "Well that's what we mean when we write square roots.",
  1357.94,
  1360.94
 ],
 [
  "Okay?",
  1361.88,
  1361.94
 ],
 [
  "And the last one was talking about negative inputs.",
  1363.32,
  1366.6
 ],
 [
  "So just as an example, if we inputted something like negative 1.",
  1367.08,
  1370.2
 ],
 [
  "So the key here is to ask about multiplying it by the value when you plug in 1.",
  1371.3,
  1377.46
 ],
 [
  "By this rule, that addition in the input turns into multiplication in the output, that has to be the same as exp of 0.",
  1378.92,
  1387.38
 ],
 [
  "Now what is exp of 0?",
  1387.94,
  1389.62
 ],
 [
  "Ooh, you know what I'm realizing.",
  1390.5,
  1392.52
 ],
 [
  "Hmm.",
  1394.04,
  1394.34
 ],
 [
  "I think I might have actually made the, entered a wrong answer there.",
  1395.48,
  1398.54
 ],
 [
  "Because in our case, in our case exp of 0 actually does come out to be the number 1.",
  1398.6,
  1404.96
 ],
 [
  "Okay, so if we plug in 0 for x, then all of these, you add them together, the only term that matters is 1.",
  1405.28,
  1411.92
 ],
 [
  "So exp of negative 1 times exp of 1 is equal to exp of 0, which is 1.",
  1411.92,
  1417.08
 ],
 [
  "So this is true in the case of exp.",
  1417.62,
  1419.32
 ],
 [
  "I, I can't actually think to myself right now if that's necessarily true.",
  1420.32,
  1426.38
 ],
 [
  "You know, if we look at our question, where it's saying all we know about f is that f of a plus b is f of a times f of b.",
  1426.6,
  1433.38

 [
  "If that necessarily implies that f of 0 is going to be 1.",
  1434.02,
  1438.58
 ],
 [
  "And I, I don't think it does.",
  1439.08,
  1441.24
 ],
 [
  "I think we could construct a function.",
  1441.28,
  1442.64
 ],
 [
  "Yeah, because we could just scale e to the x by some other amount.",
  1442.88,
  1445.18
 ],
 [
  "Okay, yeah, so actually what's graded here is not entirely correct.",
  1446.28,
  1449.56

  "The correct answer would be only 1 and 2.",
  1449.6,
  1451.92

  1457.08

 [
  "But, very interesting.",
  1457.46,
  1459.42
 ],
 [
  "So if we go back to our paper, let's see.",
  1460.4,
  1463.02
 ],
 [
  "In the case of exp, this, this value at 0 would be 1.",
  1463.5,
  1467.72
 ],
 [
  "What does that imply?",
  1467.84,
  1468.54
 ],
 [
  "Well, if we call exp of 1 e, that means we're asking what is the number which when you multiply by e equals 1.",
  1468.96,
  1475.54
 ],
 [
  "And it would be 1 divided by e.",
  1475.56,
  1477.5
 ],
 [
  "But yeah, for the general case, we need the added condition that when you plug in 0 you do get 1.",
  1478.14,
  1483.36
 ],
 [
  "Now the point of all of this, right, the reason that I'm saying this, is to emphasize why it's reasonable that we use the shorthand.",
  1484.66,
  1491.7
 ],
 [
  "That when we say exp of x, for real numbers x, why it would be very reasonable to write this as e to the power x.",
  1492.16,
  1499.02
 ],
 [
  "Because basically this special property means that because you can use the number 1 to access pretty much all the real numbers by adding it to itself or dividing as needed or negating.",
  1499.68,
  1510.6
 ],
 [
  "And then if you have certain continuity restrictions that will let you extend from rational numbers to all the reals.",
  1511.14,
  1516.86
 ],
 [
  "But that's a technical point, you don't need to fuss over for what we're doing right now.",
  1516.86,
  1522.5
 ],
 [
  "It lets you basically express everything that this polynomial can output in terms of what it outputs at the number 1.",
  1523.64,
  1529.62
 ],
 [
  "So you might read e to the x as just, whatever this polynomial is at the input 1, we can start exponentiating in terms of that.",
  1529.98,
  1537.66
 ],
 [
  "So that's the connection, right, we could, we could if we wanted define the number e to simply be where is this polynomial at the number 1.",
  1538.3,
  1545.3
 ],
 [
  "And then all of this would follow.",
  1545.78,
  1547.16
 ],
 [
  "But I really want to emphasize that only makes sense for real numbers.",
  1547.7,
  1550.86
 ],
 [
  "Because as soon as we start introducing things like complex numbers, you can't just add 1 to itself or subtract and divide and get the number i.",
  1551.1,
  1557.72
 ],
 [
  "And in math you often do even crazier things where you plug in things like matrices into this polynomial.",
  1558.2,
  1563.16
 ],
 [
  "Which seems weird, but you know, you can take a matrix and square it, you can divide it by 2, you can add all of those together.",
  1563.16,
  1570.14
 ],
 [
  "And that's actually a very useful thing.",
  1570.14,
  1572.24

 [
  "It's very useful for a field called differential equations, which in turn is useful for physics.",
  1572.42,
  1577.08

 [
  "In quantum mechanics you often plug in these things called operators, which are kind of like the mature older brother of matrices.",
  1578.12,
  1585.14
 ],
 [
  "And all of that looks totally nonsensical if we're talking about a constant raised to some kind of power.",
  1585.34,
  1590.98
 ],
 [
  "But what you have to understand is that it's being plugged into this polynomial.",
  1590.98,
  1594.44
 ],
 [
  "So I understand why we have the convention of writing this as e to the x.",
  1595.82,
  1599.6
 ],
 [
  "It makes sense for real numbers.",
  1599.8,
  1601.38
 ],

  "But I think that's actually a bad convention as soon as we start extending it.",
  1601.68,
  1605.24
 ],
 [
  "And I think that causes a lot of undue confusion.",
  1605.24,
  1607.38

  1608.16,
  1613.18

  "For which values of n does i to the power n equal negative i?",
  1638.98,

  1650.74,

  1654.46,
  1657.2

  1680.54
 ],
 [
  "Yeah, okay.",
  1680.74,
  1681.12
 ],
 [
  "So they're saying that if f of x ever outputs zero.",
  1681.3,
  1685.5
 ],
 [
  "Actually, I'm not entirely sure what Sam is saying.",
  1686.68,
  1688.22
 ],
 [
  "F of x equals zero doesn't work with f of negative one equals one over f of one.",
  1688.4,
  1693.38
