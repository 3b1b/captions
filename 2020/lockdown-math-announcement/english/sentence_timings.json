  "With each lecture, I want to cover something that's a standard high school topic that most high schoolers will be expected to learn, but at the same time to have some kind of intriguing angle on it that's a little bit different from what most people might have seen, just so that if you aren't a high school student and you're someone like me, there's still something interesting about it.",
