00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
As many of you know, with the coronavirus outbreak still very much underway,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,320
there's a huge number of students who are left to learn remotely from home,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,220
whether that means doing distance classes over video conference

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,140
or trying to find resources like Khan Academy and Brilliant to learn online.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,200
So one thing that I wanted to do in the next coming weeks,

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,240
which is very different for me on this channel,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,100
is to do some live-streamed lectures specifically targeted at high school students.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,400
With each lecture, I want to cover something that's a standard high school topic

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,500
that most high schoolers will be expected to learn,

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,140
but at the same time to have some kind of intriguing angle on it

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,240
that's a little bit different from what most people might have seen,

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,580
just so that if you aren't a high school student and you're someone like me,

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,340
there's still something interesting about it.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,820
For example, the very first lesson is going to be on a simpler version of the quadratic formula,

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,140
and while I was putting together this lesson,

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,580
I honestly felt a little bit mad that this isn't the way that I learned things when I was in high school,

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,860
so if you can get that same feeling, I'm going to call that mission success.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,800
One thing I'm particularly excited about is a little piece of technology

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,620
that two good friends of mine, who I used to work at Khan Academy with, have been working on,

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,800
which I think should make the dynamic between the audience and the progression of the lecture

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,740
feel a little bit more tight than it usually does in some kind of live-stream situation.

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,620
I don't want to say anything more, I would just say,

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,300
show up, be prepared to answer some questions, and to ask questions too.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,480
My goal is for it to feel as much like a real class as possible.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,740
Most of the dynamic is just going to be you and me talking through problems on a piece of paper,

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,860
which, even though I love to visualize stuff and put out animations

27
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,520
and that's kind of what the whole channel is about,

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,400
to be honest, I think just working through things on paper feels more like what actual math is to me,

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,100
and what the process of finding new ideas and coming to terms with them yourself looks like.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,780
The tentative plan right now is to do every Friday and Tuesday at noon Pacific time,

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,100
but if anything changes on that, you'll see the schedule on the banner of the channel.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,980
So tune in, I hope to see you there, and be prepared to do some math.
