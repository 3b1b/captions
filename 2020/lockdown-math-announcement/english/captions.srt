00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As many of you know, with the coronavirus outbreak still very much underway,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
there's a huge number of students who are left to learn remotely from home,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
whether that means doing distance classes over video conference

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,200
or trying to find resources like Khan Academy and Brilliant to learn online.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
So one thing that I wanted to do in the next coming weeks,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,500
which is very different for me on this channel,

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,200
is to do some live-streamed lectures specifically targeted at high school students.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,400
With each lecture, I want to cover something that's a standard high school topic

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,700
that most high schoolers will be expected to learn,

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,100
but at the same time to have some kind of intriguing angle on it

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,400
that's a little bit different from what most people might have seen,

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,700
just so that if you aren't a high school student and you're someone like me,

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,400
there's still something interesting about it.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,100
For example, the very first lesson is going to be on a simpler version of the quadratic formula,

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,300
and while I was putting together this lesson,

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,700
I honestly felt a little bit mad that this isn't the way that I learned things when I was in high school,

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,300
so if you can get that same feeling, I'm going to call that mission success.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,700
One thing I'm particularly excited about is a little piece of technology

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,300
that two good friends of mine, who I used to work at Khan Academy with, have been working on,

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,900
which I think should make the dynamic between the audience and the progression of the lecture

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,700
feel a little bit more tight than it usually does in some kind of live-stream situation.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,500
I don't want to say anything more, I would just say,

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,100
show up, be prepared to answer some questions, and to ask questions too.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,400
My goal is for it to feel as much like a real class as possible.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,700
Most of the dynamic is just going to be you and me talking through problems on a piece of paper,

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,700
which, even though I love to visualize stuff and put out animations

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
and that's kind of what the whole channel is about,

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,300
to be honest, I think just working through things on paper feels more like what actual math is to me,

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,300
and what the process of finding new ideas and coming to terms with them yourself looks like.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,900
The tentative plan right now is to do every Friday and Tuesday at noon Pacific time,

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,300
but if anything changes on that, you'll see the schedule on the banner of the channel.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,300
So tune in, I hope to see you there, and be prepared to do some math.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Thanks for watching!
