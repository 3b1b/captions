00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,715
As many of you know, with the coronavirus outbreak still very much underway, 

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:07,383
there's a huge number of students who are left to learn remotely from home, 

3
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:10,954
whether that means doing distance classes over video conference or trying 

4
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:14,140
to find resources like Khan Academy and Brilliant to learn online.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,073
So one thing that I wanted to do in the next coming weeks, 

6
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,282
which is very different for me on this channel, 

7
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:23,100
is to do some live-streamed lectures specifically targeted at high school students.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,376
With each lecture, I want to cover something that's a standard high school 

9
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,770
topic that most high schoolers will be expected to learn, 

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,826
but at the same time to have some kind of intriguing angle on it that's a 

11
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,303
little bit different from what most people might have seen, 

12
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:37,482
just so that if you aren't a high school student and you're someone like me, 

13
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,340
there's still something interesting about it.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,037
For example, the very first lesson is going to be on a simpler version of the 

15
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:45,885
quadratic formula, and while I was putting together this lesson, 

16
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:49,347
I honestly felt a little bit mad that this isn't the way that I learned things 

17
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:52,151
when I was in high school, so if you can get that same feeling, 

18
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,860
I'm going to call that mission success.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,254
One thing I'm particularly excited about is a little piece of technology that two good 

20
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:01,761
friends of mine, who I used to work at Khan Academy with, have been working on, 

21
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,531
which I think should make the dynamic between the audience and the progression of the 

22
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:09,301
lecture feel a little bit more tight than it usually does in some kind of live-stream 

23
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:09,740
situation.

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,618
I don't want to say anything more, I would just say, show up, 

25
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:15,300
be prepared to answer some questions, and to ask questions too.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,480
My goal is for it to feel as much like a real class as possible.

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,917
Most of the dynamic is just going to be you and me talking through problems on a 

28
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:27,291
piece of paper, which, even though I love to visualize stuff and put out animations 

29
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,727
and that's kind of what the whole channel is about, to be honest, 

30
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:35,309
I think just working through things on paper feels more like what actual math is to me, 

31
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:39,527
and what the process of finding new ideas and coming to terms with them yourself 

32
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:40,100
looks like.

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,287
The tentative plan right now is to do every Friday and Tuesday at noon Pacific time, 

34
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:48,100
but if anything changes on that, you'll see the schedule on the banner of the channel.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,720
So tune in, I hope to see you there, and be prepared to do some math.
