1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
I want to share with you a few simulations that model how an epidemic spreads.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,000
There have recently been a few wonderful interactive articles in this vein, including one in the

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,280
Washington Post by Harry Stevens, and then another by Kevin Simler over at Melting Asphalt.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,720
They are great, you can play with them, they're very informative, I'll of course leave links

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
in the description.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,260
After seeing those, I had a few more questions.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,800
Like if people stay away from each other, I get that that's going to slow down the

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
spread.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,760
But despite mostly staying away from each other, people still occasionally go to a central

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,560
location, like a grocery store or a school.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,080
Also what if you're able to identify and isolate the cases?

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,220
And if you can, what if a few slip through, say because they don't show symptoms so

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,640
they aren't tested?

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,840
How does travel between separate communities affect things?

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,920
And what if people avoid contact with each other for a while, but then they kind of get

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,120
tired and stop?

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:10,880
We'll explore these questions and more, but first let's walk through how exactly

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,060
these models will work.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,600
Each simulation represents what's called an SIR model, meaning the population is broken

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,600
up into three categories, those who are susceptible to getting the disease, those who are infectious,

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,800
and then those who have recovered from the infection, so people who are immune don't

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,440
play into it.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,240
The way I've written these, for every unit of time that a susceptible person spends within

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,180
a certain infection radius of someone with the disease, they'll have some probability

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,240
of contracting it themselves, so we're using physical proximity as a stand-in for things

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,400
like shaking hands, touching the same surface, kissing, sneezing on each other, all that

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,000
good stuff.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,260
Then for each infectious person, after some amount of time they'll recover and no longer

29
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,440
be able to spread the disease.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,500
If they die, they also won't be able to spread it anymore, so as a more generic term,

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,180
sometimes people consider the R in SIR to stand for removed.

32
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,120
This should go without saying, but let me emphasize it at the start anyway.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,180
These are toy models, with a tiny population, inevitably falling far short of the complexities

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,640
in real people and larger populations.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,380
I am not an epidemiologist, so I would be very hesitant to generalize any of the lessons

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,280
here without deeper consideration.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,400
That said, I think it can be healthy to engage the little scientist inside all of us and

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,040
take the chance to be experimental and quantitative, even if it's in a necessarily limited fashion,

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,280
especially if the alternative is to dwell on headlines and uncertainty.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
We'll start things simple and layer on more complexity gradually.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,980
In these first few runs that you're looking at, everybody is simply meandering around

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,400
the city in a kind of random walk, and the infection follows the rules we've laid out.

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:05,940
So, it doesn't look great.

44
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,440
After not too long, almost everybody gets infected.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,400
As a sanity check, what would you expect to happen if I double this radius of infection?

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,340
You might think of this as representing more total interactions between people, or a more

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,960
socially engaged society.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,120
You'll spread more quickly, of course, but how much?

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,280
It's actually very drastic.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,240
Within a short time span, the majority of our little population is infected simultaneously.

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,920
As another sanity check, what would you expect if we go back to the original infection radius

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,320
and cut the probability of infection in half?

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,660
Remember, the way this is running, for each day that a susceptible person is within that

54
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,380
radius of an infectious person, they have some probability of becoming infected.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,620
By default I've set it to 20%, but this is the number we're going to cut in half.

56
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:16,860
You might think of this as better hand washing, better cough protection, and less face touching.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,300
As you might expect, it spreads out the curve.

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,980
In fact, it does this by quite a lot, which really illustrates how changes to hygiene

59
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,460
have very large effects on the rate of spreading.

60
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,180
The first of several key takeaways here that I'd like you to tuck away in your mind is

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,740
just how sensitive this growth can be to each parameter in our control.

62
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,300
It's not that hard to imagine changing your daily habits in a way that multiplies the

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,180
number of people you interact with, or that cuts your probability of catching an infection

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,860
in half, but the implications for the pace of the spread are huge.

65
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,700
The goal is probably to reduce the total number of people who die, which is some proportion

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,700
of this removed category in the end.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,940
That proportion is not a constant, though.

68
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,900
If you get to a point where the peak of the infection curve is too high, meaning there's

69
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,180
a time when many people are all sick at once, that's the point when available healthcare

70
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,100
resources are overwhelmed, which for a bad disease will increase the mortality rate.

71
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,720
Now I don't know where you're from, but in most towns people don't actually spend

72
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,900
their days drunkenly wandering around the city like this.

73
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,660
Often there's a common destination, like a central market or a school.

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,820
In our model, if we introduce some central spot like this that people regularly visit

75
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:38,860
and then return from, it'sâ€¦ well, just look.

76
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,060
One of the main things I was curious about is how to mitigate this effect, and that's

77
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,580
something we'll examine in just a bit.

78
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,780
Another feature we could include is to have a few separate communities with transit between

79
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,780
them.

80
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,820
Every day, each person will have some probability of traveling to the center of another community,

81
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,160
and then going about their usual routine from there.

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,860
All of that is our basic setup, so now the question is what actions help to stop this

83
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,600
spread?

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,060
What is by far most effective is to identify and isolate whoever is infectious, for example

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,880
with good testing and quick responsiveness.

86
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,820
In our simulations, once we hit some critical threshold of cases, we're going to start

87
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,780
sending people to a separate location one day after they have the infection.

88
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,040
This is of course a stand-in for whatever isolation would look like in the real world,

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,020
it doesn't have to literally be transporting all the sick people into one sad box.

90
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,360
Unsurprisingly this totally halts the epidemic in its tracks.

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,020
But what if when you're infected you have a 20% chance of not getting quarantined, say

92
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,220
because you show no symptoms so you don't get tested, and you go about your day as usual?

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,740
We're going to illustrate these people that have no symptoms using yellow circles instead

94
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,120
of red.

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,740
Obviously this will have a result somewhere between a total quarantine and doing nothing,

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:18,440
would you predict it'll be?

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,460
The peak number of simultaneous cases is only a little bit higher, but there is a very long

98
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,320
tail as it takes a much longer time to stamp out, resulting in about twice as many total

99
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,080
cases.

100
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,500
This gets more interesting when we do it in a setting with many communities and transit

101
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,880
between them.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,500
Again totally effective tracking in isolation stops the epidemic very quickly.

103
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,300
But what would you predict is going to happen if now 20% of the infectious cases slipped

104
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,320
through that process?

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,000
Again I've set things to wait until a certain critical threshold of cases is hit before

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,320
our little dot society kicks into gear and takes action.

107
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,360
As a side note it's a little interesting that even when all the parameters are the

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,600
same, some runs take three times longer to reach this point than others.

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,980
Before the law of large numbers kicks in, that pace of growth can have as much to do

110
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:19,440
with the roll of the dice as it does with anything intrinsic to the disease itself.

111
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,120
This leaky quarantining effort definitely flattens out the curve, but it is a much thicker

112
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,920
tail and takes a much longer time to track down all the cases, with over half the population

113
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,700
getting infected this time.

114
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,740
Now what would you predict if it was only 50% of the infectious cases that were isolated

115
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,800
like this?

116
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,400
If half the infectious people are getting quarantined, it doesn't mean that half the

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,280
total population will end up with the disease.

118
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,400
Because there are so many agents still out there spreading it, we end up with a situation

119
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,760
that's only barely better than if nothing had been done at all.

120
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,320
A second key takeaway here is that changes in how many people slip through the tests

121
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,540
can cause disproportionately large changes to the total number of people infected.

122
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,400
If we look back to the fact that quickly containing cases so early is so effective, it actually

123
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,920
has an interesting corollary, which is that the most lethal diseases are in some sense

124
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,040
less dangerous globally.

125
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,960
Remember that the rule of this quarantine simulation is to send infectious people to

126
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,880
a separate spot one day after they've been infected, but if the disease kills its host

127
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,620
after one day, the model looks identical, it just has a much darker interpretation.

128
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,600
It is terrible for those who get it, but it doesn't spread.

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,260
It also means that the most dangerous viruses are the ones that kill some part of the population

130
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,760
while laying unnoticed and spreadable among others, or worse yet, if they remain unnoticed

131
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,340
and spreadable in everyone before eventually becoming lethal.

132
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,760
One of the reasons that the SARS outbreak in 2002 was so well contained is that just

133
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,860
about everybody in this infectious population was showing symptoms, so they were much easier

134
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,560
to identify and isolate.

135
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,320
A more optimistic corollary of these quarantine simulations is how useful early treatment

136
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,380
can be.

137
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,980
If there exists an antiviral therapeutic that can move people out of this infectious category

138
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,060
quickly, it has the same effect on the model as isolating those cases.

139
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:33,180
But let's say you don't have widespread testing or antiviral therapeutics.

140
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,220
Let's introduce a new parameter here, which is how much people try to avoid each other,

141
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,100
let's call it the social distance factor.

142
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,540
In these animations, I'll apply it as a repulsive force between people, and have them

143
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,940
glow yellow when they feel too close to their neighbor.

144
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,580
This has the sad but kind of cute effect that when our little agents are social distancing,

145
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,720
they often end up trembling near the edge of their box.

146
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,740
No isolation is perfect, though, so every now and then even those repulsed by each other

147
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,680
will jiggle close enough to get infected.

148
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,180
The point is that those interactions are much rarer.

149
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,380
Let's take a look at four separate runs here.

150
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,840
In each one of them, after we hit 50 cases, I'll turn on social distancing.

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,900
But in the top left, we'll turn it on for everybody.

152
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,860
In the top right, we'll turn it on for 90% of the population.

153
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,820
In the bottom left, for 70% of the population, and in the bottom right, for only half the

154
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,380
population.

155
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:38,480
What would you predict is going to happen?

156
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,920
As you might expect, when 100% of people avoid each other, the disease quickly goes

157
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,860
away, entirely.

158
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,300
And in all four cases, the presence of some kind of widespread social distancing definitely

159
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,920
flattens out the curve.

160
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,240
However, in terms of the ultimate number of cases, the run with 70% and even the one with

161
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,760
90% end up with a little less than half the population ultimately getting infected, which

162
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,240
is only a tiny bit better than the one with 50%.

163
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,760
That case with 90% of people repelling each other certainly takes longer to get there,

164
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,560
but evidently a mere 10% of the population cheating adds enough instability to our system

165
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,240
to keep the fire slowly burning for a long time.

166
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,680
Again, I'll emphasize that these are toy models, and I leave it to the viewer to judge

167
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,060
if the behavior of these little dots accurately reflects what social distancing would mean

168
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,640
for you and your life.

169
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,720
Everyone fully sequestered in their home is not necessarily affected by the random jiggling

170
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,920
of their neighbor, but then again, few of us genuinely live independently from everyone

171
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,160
else.

172
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,040
Insofar as these models aren't outlandish, the third key takeaway is that social distancing

173
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,420
absolutely works to flatten the curve, but even small imperfections prolong the spread

174
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,320
for a while.

175
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,720
Now let's look at that setup with 12 communities and travel between them.

176
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,760
By default, I have it set so that every day each agent has a 2% chance of traveling to

177
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,200
the center of a different community.

178
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,960
Now let's try a run where once we hit 100 cases, we cut down that travel rate by a factor

179
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,520
of 4, to only half a percent.

180
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
What would you predict is going to happen?

181
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,340
The honest answer is that it depends.

182
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,900
In some runs, it doesn't make any difference, and the majority of every community gets it.

183
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,120
Other times, there are a couple communities that end up unscathed.

184
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,700
In general, the earlier you turn on this effect, the more effective it is, but the takeaway

185
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,840
here is that reducing contact between communities really has only a limited effect once those

186
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:09,840
communities already have it, and as solutions go, it's certainly not robust on its own.

187
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,960
As a side note, when we run these simulations with larger cities, which has the effect that

188
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,540
city centers act like concentrated urban hubs, you can see how as soon as the infection hits

189
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:27,040
one of these urban centers, it very quickly hits all of them, and after that it slowly

190
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
spreads to the edges of each community.

191
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,720
Let's take a moment to talk about how to quantify this spread.

192
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,880
Consider one person with the disease, and then count how many people they infect while

193
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,200
they have it.

194
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,400
The average for this count across everybody who's been sick is known as the effective

195
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,600
reproductive number, or R. A more commonly discussed number is R-naught, which is the

196
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,380
value of R in a fully susceptible population, like at the very beginning.

197
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,860
This is known as the basic reproductive number.

198
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,560
You may have noticed I have this little label on our simulations, and the way it's being

199
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,520
calculated is to look at each individual who's currently infectious, count how many people

200
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,080
they've infected so far, estimate how many they're going to infect in total based on

201
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,000
the duration of the illness, and then average those numbers.

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,320
For example, in our first default simulation with no added spices, R is around 2.2 at the

203
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,020
highest part of the growth phase, before falling down as the population becomes saturated.

204
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,260
By contrast, when we doubled the infection radius, R was as high as 8!

205
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,840
This factor has a huge effect on the growth rate.

206
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,160
It should kind of make sense that it jumped up as high as 8, though.

207
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,560
When you double that radius, there's about 4 times as many people inside it to infect.

208
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,180
When we chopped the infection rate in half, it hovered around the 1.3 to 1.7 range.

209
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,520
While R is greater than 1, the infection is growing exponentially, and it's at that

210
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,080
point that it's known as an epidemic.

211
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,000
When it holds steady around 1, that's when a disease is called endemic, and less than

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,640
1 means it's on the decline.

213
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,460
For comparison, R-naught for COVID-19 is estimated to be a little above 2, which is also around

214
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,380
what the mean estimate for R-naught was during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

215
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,580
The seasonal flu by comparison is much lower, around 1.3.

216
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,220
In the travel case, as soon as we turn on social distancing and shut down travel, you

217
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,460
can see R quickly drop down from 2.

218
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,080
There's a little bit of a lag between the change we make to the model and the value

219
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,280
of this number, since it's calculated based on current infectious cases, which might have

220
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:53,380
existed prior to the method being put in place.

221
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,840
Like I said at the start, one of the things I was most curious about is the effect of

222
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,540
some kind of shared central location, like a market or a school.

223
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:08,940
When I introduce such a destination for our little dots, R-naught jumps as high as 5.8.

224
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,440
This might be a little unfair, since it puts everyone right in the same spot, and given

225
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,460
that we're using physical proximity as a stand-in for things like shaking hands or

226
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,180
kissing, we should maybe acknowledge that people going to the same school or grocery

227
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,020
store are not as likely to spread an infection as, say, close friends or people living in

228
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,660
the same house.

229
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,700
To account for this, let's conservatively cut the probability of infection per day in

230
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,140
half.

231
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:41,700
This does indeed cut R-naught in half, but the effect of a central market remains dramatic.

232
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:51,160
Now let's try a run where after some threshold is hit, we turn on social distancing, but

233
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:59,960
people still go to that central location the way they did before.

234
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,840
You may notice that some of our little dots seem to have escaped their little cage, which

235
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,640
was not supposed to happen, but I'm going to make the conscious choice not to fix that.

236
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,060
It's like they all looked at the chaos inside and just went, nope, I'm out, I don't

237
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,620
want any part of that.

238
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,500
Living in the Bay Area during a shelter-in-place order, I can confirm that this is how some

239
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,260
people react.

240
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,740
Wandering dots aside, let me show you how this graph compares to the control case where

241
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,560
we did nothing, and how it compares to what would have happened if in addition to repelling

242
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,500
from each other, all of the dots also stopped going to that central location.

243
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,580
The peak of the infection curve is a little lower than the control, but in terms of the

244
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,440
total number of cases, keeping that central location active really defeats the effects

245
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,920
of otherwise social distancing.

246
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,860
Now let me ask you to make a prediction.

247
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,720
What do you think will be more effective?

248
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,960
If on top of that social distancing effect, we decrease the frequency with which people

249
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,580
go to that central spot, maybe by a factor of 5, or if we chop the probability of infection

250
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,800
down by another factor of 2, for example meaning people are super extra cautious about washing

251
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,140
their hands and not touching their face.

252
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,340
The simulation on the left requires our dots to very heavily alter their daily routines,

253
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,220
whereas on the right our dots can mostly continue their usual habits, but they're just much

254
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,660
more conscious of hygiene.

255
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,980
They're actually nearly identical, which surprised me, given that one of them is a

256
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,700
fivefold decrease and the other is twofold.

257
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,620
I guess it goes to show that the effect of hygiene, which is maybe easier said than done,

258
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,840
really goes a long way.

259
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,800
Of course, it doesn't have to be an either-or.

260
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,960
Our goal with these experiments is to look at the effects of one change at a time.

261
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,160
If you're curious, here's what it looks like when we apply social distancing, we restrict

262
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,920
the rate that people go to the central location, and we also lower the infection rate all at once.

263
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,320
This combination is, indeed, very effective.

264
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,660
But I want to emphasize again how the most desirable case is when you can consistently

265
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,360
identify and isolate cases.

266
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,340
Even in this central market simulation, which left unchecked gives a huge conflagration,

267
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,940
being able to do this effectively still halts the epidemic, and our little dots don't

268
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,500
have to be repelled by each other or stop their trips to the central spot.

269
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,100
In real epidemiology, by the way, it gets way more sophisticated than this, with tactics

270
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,760
like contact tracing, where you not only identify and isolate known cases, but you

271
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:42,640
do the same for everyone who's been in contact with those cases.

272
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,320
Given the time I'm posting this, I imagine there's some expectation for it to be a

273
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,780
PSA on social distancing.

274
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,040
But to be honest, that's not really my own main takeaway.

275
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,040
To be clear, when it's needed, like it is now, social distancing absolutely saves lives,

276
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,900
and as we saw earlier, when people cheat or when they continue to regularly meet at

277
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,060
a central spot, it has a disproportionate effect on the long-term number of cases.

278
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,020
The uncomfortable truth, though, is that while the disease still exists, as soon as people

279
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,500
let up and they go back to their normal lives, if nothing is in place to contain the cases,

280
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:22,320
few though they might be, you'll just get a second wave.

281
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,300
After making all of these, what I came away with more than anything else was a deeper

282
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,280
appreciation for disease control done right, for the inordinate value of early widespread

283
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,480
testing and the ability to isolate cases, for therapeutics that treat these cases, and

284
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,760
most importantly, for how easy it is to underestimate all that value when times are good.

285
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,480
I'm writing this during a pandemic, when some viewers may be able to identify a little

286
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,540
too well with the trembling dots retreating to the edge of their box.

287
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,140
But in the future, many people will be watching this during a pandemic that never was, a time

288
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,880
when a novel pathogen that could have spread widely if left unchecked was instead swiftly

289
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,120
found and contained.

290
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,400
Those would-be pandemics never make it into the history books, which is maybe why we don't

291
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,680
value the heroes behind them the way we should.

292
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,440
Living in a world with widespread travel and vibrant urban centers does make fighting the

293
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,240
spread of a disease an uphill battle, that's absolutely true.

294
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,760
But that same level of connectedness means that ideas spread more quickly than ever,

295
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,080
ideas that can lead to systems and technologies that nip these outbreaks in the bud.

296
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,260
It won't happen on its own, and it's clear that we sometimes make mistakes, but I'm

297
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:38,700
fundamentally optimistic about our ability to learn from those mistakes.

298
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,860
As you might imagine, these videos require a lot of hours of effort.

299
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,620
I don't do any ad reads at the end, and YouTube content related to the current pandemic seems

300
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,020
to be systematically demonetized, so I just want to take this chance to say a particularly

301
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,200
warm thank you to those who support them directly on Patreon.

302
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
It really does make a difference.
