00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,460
I want to share with you a few simulations that model how an epidemic spreads.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,215
There have recently been a few wonderful interactive articles in this vein, 

3
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:13,918
including one in the Washington Post by Harry Stevens, 

4
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:16,720
and then another by Kevin Simler over at Melting Asphalt.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,664
They are great, you can play with them, they're very informative, 

6
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,340
I'll of course leave links in the description.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,600
After seeing those, I had a few more questions.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,860
Like if people stay away from each other, I get that that's going to slow down the spread.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,022
But what if despite mostly staying away from each other, 

10
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:36,320
people still occasionally go to a central location, like a grocery store or a school?

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,500
Also, what if you're able to identify and isolate the cases?

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,181
And if you can, what if a few slip through, say 

13
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:45,980
because they don't show symptoms so they aren't tested?

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,220
How does travel between separate communities affect things?

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,986
And what if people avoid contact with each other for a while, 

16
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,160
but then they kind of get tired and stop?

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,329
We'll explore these questions and more, but first 

18
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,040
let's walk through how exactly these models will work.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,709
Each simulation represents what's called an SIR model, 

20
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,938
meaning the population is broken up into three categories, 

21
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:23,097
those who are susceptible to getting the disease, those who are infectious, 

22
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:26,052
and then those who have recovered from the infection, 

23
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,460
so people who are immune don't play into it.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,059
The way I've written these, for every unit of time that a susceptible 

25
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,216
person spends within a certain infection radius of someone with the disease, 

26
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:40,455
they'll have some probability of contracting it themselves, 

27
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:44,720
so we're using physical proximity as a stand-in for things like shaking hands, 

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,040
touching the same surface, kissing, sneezing on each other, all that good stuff.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,058
Then for each infectious person, after some amount of time they'll recover and no longer 

30
00:01:55,058 --> 00:02:00,199
be able to spread the disease, or if they die they won't be able to spread it anymore, 

31
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:05,340
so as a more generic term, sometimes people consider the R in SIR to stand for removed.

32
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,520
This should go without saying, but let me emphasize it at the start anyway.

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,389
These are toy models, with a tiny population, inevitably falling 

34
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,040
far short of the complexities in real people and larger populations.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,815
I am not an epidemiologist, so I would be very hesitant to 

36
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:25,260
generalize any of the lessons here without deeper consideration.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,700
That said, I think it can be healthy to engage the little scientist inside all of us 

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,866
and take the chance to be experimental and quantitative, 

39
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:36,476
even if it's in a necessarily limited fashion, 

40
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:40,420
especially if the alternative is to dwell on headlines and uncertainty.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,080
We'll start things simple and layer on more complexity gradually.

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,091
In these first few runs that you're looking at, 

43
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:52,123
everybody is simply meandering around the city in a kind of random walk, 

44
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:54,940
and the infection follows the rules we've laid out.

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,440
So it doesn't look great, after not too long almost everybody gets infected.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,640
As a sanity check, what would you expect to happen if I double this radius of infection?

47
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,070
You might think of this as representing more total interactions between people, 

48
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,720
or a more socially engaged society.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,340
It'll spread more quickly, of course, but how much?

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,640
It's actually very drastic.

51
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,607
Within a short time span, the majority of our 

52
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,060
little population is infected simultaneously.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,721
As another sanity check, what would you expect if we go back to the 

54
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,800
original infection radius, and then cut the probability of infection in half?

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,575
Remember, the way this is running, for each day that a susceptible person is within 

56
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:53,720
that radius of an infectious person, they have some probability of becoming infected.

57
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,420
By default I've set it to 20%, but this is the number we're now going to cut in half.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,709
You might think of this as better hand washing, 

59
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,980
better cough protection, and less face touching.

60
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,100
As you might expect, it spreads out the curve.

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,022
In fact it does this by quite a lot, which really illustrates how 

62
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:26,260
changes to hygiene have very large effects on the rate of spreading.

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,970
The first of several key takeaways here that I'd like you to tuck away in your 

64
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,860
mind is just how sensitive this growth can be to each parameter in our control.

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,424
It's not that hard to imagine changing your daily habits in a way that multiplies 

66
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:46,328
the number of people you interact with, or that cuts your probability of catching 

67
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:50,090
an infection in half, but the implications for the pace of the spread are huge.

68
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,429
The goal is probably to reduce the total number of people who die, 

69
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,870
which is some proportion of this removed category in the end.

70
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,750
That proportion is not a constant, though.

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,405
If you get to a point where the peak of the infection curve is too high, 

72
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,510
meaning there's a time when many people are all sick at once, 

73
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,015
that's the point when available healthcare resources are overwhelmed, 

74
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:14,870
which for a bad disease will increase the mortality rate.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,977
Now I don't know where you're from, but in most towns people don't 

76
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:22,230
actually spend their days drunkenly wandering around the city like this.

77
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,770
Often there's a common destination, like a central market or a school.

78
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,346
In our model, if we introduce some central spot like this that 

79
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:34,470
people regularly visit and then return from, it'sâ€¦ well, just look.

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,929
One of the main things I was curious about is how to mitigate this effect, 

81
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:44,530
and that's something we'll examine in just a bit.

82
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,517
Another feature we could include is to have a 

83
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:50,010
few separate communities with transit between them.

84
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,405
Every day, each person will have some probability of traveling to the center 

85
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:58,110
of another community, and then going about their usual routine from there.

86
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,778
All of that is our basic setup, so now the question 

87
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:05,230
is what actions help to stop this spread?

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,871
What is by far most effective is to identify and isolate whoever is infectious, 

89
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,870
for example with good testing and quick responsiveness.

90
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,097
In our simulations, once we hit some critical threshold of cases, 

91
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:24,232
we're going to start sending people to a separate location one day after they have 

92
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:24,930
the infection.

93
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,480
This is of course a stand-in for whatever isolation would look like in the real world, 

94
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,770
it doesn't have to literally be transporting all the sick people into one sad box.

95
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,350
Unsurprisingly, this totally halts the epidemic in its tracks.

96
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,392
But what if when you're infected you have a 20% chance of not getting quarantined, 

97
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:46,259
say because you show no symptoms so you don't get tested, 

98
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,990
and you go about your day as usual?

99
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,022
We're going to illustrate these people that have 

100
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,190
no symptoms using yellow circles instead of red.

101
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,328
Obviously this will have a result somewhere between a total quarantine and doing nothing, 

102
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,990
but where on the spectrum would you predict it'll be?

103
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,832
The peak number of simultaneous cases is only a little bit higher, 

104
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:26,150
but there is a very low long tail as it takes a much longer time to stamp out, 

105
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,610
resulting in about twice as many total cases.

106
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,695
This gets more interesting when we do it in a 

107
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:35,190
setting with many communities and transit between them.

108
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,201
Again, totally effective tracking in isolation stops the epidemic very quickly, 

109
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,570
but what would you predict is going to happen if now 20% of 

110
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,210
the infectious cases slip through that process?

111
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,228
Again, I've set things to wait until a certain critical threshold of 

112
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:53,730
cases is hit before our little dot society kicks into gear and takes action.

113
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,006
As a side note, it's a little interesting that even when all the parameters are the same, 

114
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,790
some runs take three times longer to reach this point than others.

115
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,154
Before the law of large numbers kicks in, that pace of growth can have as much to do 

116
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:08,870
with the roll of the dice as it does with anything intrinsic to the disease itself.

117
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,607
This leaky quarantining effort definitely flattens out the curve, 

118
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:27,403
but it is a much thicker tail and takes a much longer time to track down all the cases, 

119
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,510
with over half the population getting infected this time.

120
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,839
Now, what would you predict if it was only 50% of 

121
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,390
the infectious cases that were isolated like this?

122
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,955
If half the infectious people are getting quarantined, 

123
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,390
it doesn't mean that half the total population will end up with the disease.

124
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,284
Because there are so many agents still out there spreading it, 

125
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:55,990
we end up with a situation that's only barely better than if nothing had been done at all.

126
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,083
A second key takeaway here is that changes in how many people slip through the tests 

127
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:09,630
can cause disproportionately large changes to the total number of people infected.

128
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,598
If we look back to the fact that quickly containing cases so early is so effective, 

129
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:19,445
it actually has an interesting corollary, which is that the most lethal 

130
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:22,170
diseases are in some sense less dangerous globally.

131
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,590
Remember that the rule of this quarantine simulation is to send infectious people to 

132
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,458
a separate spot one day after they've been infected, 

133
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,571
but if the disease kills its host after one day, the model looks identical, 

134
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:36,790
it just has a much darker interpretation.

135
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,450
It is terrible for those who get it, but it doesn't spread.

136
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,148
It also means that the most dangerous viruses are the ones that kill some part of 

137
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:50,070
the population in the first place, while laying unnoticed and spreadable among others.

138
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,382
Or worse yet, if they remain unnoticed and spreadable 

139
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:55,830
in everyone before eventually becoming lethal.

140
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,546
One of the reasons that the SARS outbreak in 2002 was so well 

141
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:04,303
contained is that just about everybody in this infectious population 

142
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,170
was showing symptoms, so they were much easier to identify and isolate.

143
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,122
A more optimistic corollary of these quarantine 

144
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:14,810
simulations is how useful early treatment can be.

145
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,856
If there exists an antiviral therapeutic that can move people out of this infectious 

146
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:24,250
category quickly, it has the same effect on the model as isolating those cases.

147
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,950
But let's say you don't have widespread testing or antiviral therapeutics.

148
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,931
Well, let's introduce a new parameter here, which 

149
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,910
is how much people try to avoid each other.

150
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,270
Let's call it the social distance factor.

151
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,417
In these animations, I'll apply it as a repulsive force between people, 

152
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:48,530
and have them glow yellow when they feel just a little too close to their neighbor.

153
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,325
This has the sad but kind of cute effect that when our little agents are 

154
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,910
social distancing, they often end up trembling near the edge of their box.

155
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,336
No isolation is perfect, though, so every now and then even those 

156
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,970
repulsed by each other will jiggle close enough to get infected.

157
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,090
The point is that those interactions are much rarer.

158
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,930
Let's take a look at four separate runs here.

159
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,130
In each one of them, after we hit 50 cases, I'll turn on social distancing.

160
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,210
But in the top left, we'll turn it on for everybody.

161
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,210
In the top right, we'll turn it on for 90% of the population.

162
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,361
In the bottom left, for 70% of the population, 

163
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,430
and in the bottom right, for only half the population.

164
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,550
What would you predict is going to happen?

165
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,570
As you might expect, when 100% of people avoid each other, 

166
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,930
the disease quickly goes away, entirely.

167
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,285
And in all four cases, the presence of some kind of 

168
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,430
widespread social distancing definitely flattens out the curve.

169
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,209
However, in terms of the ultimate number of cases, 

170
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,591
the run with 70% and even the one with 90% end up with a little less than 

171
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,492
half the population ultimately getting infected, 

172
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:04,690
which is only a tiny bit better than the one with 50%.

173
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,179
That case with 90% of people repelling each other certainly takes longer to get there, 

174
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,712
but evidently a mere 10% of the population cheating adds enough instability 

175
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:18,410
to our system to keep the fire slowly burning for a long time.

176
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,104
Again, I'll emphasize that these are toy models, 

177
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:28,750
and I leave it to the intelligence of the viewer to judge if the behavior 

178
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,446
of these little dots accurately reflects what social distancing would mean 

179
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,530
for you and your life.

180
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,521
Someone fully sequestered in their home is not necessarily 

181
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:41,213
affected by the random jiggling of their neighbor, but then again, 

182
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,410
few of us genuinely live independently from everyone else.

183
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,565
Insofar as these models aren't outlandish, the third key takeaway 

184
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:51,968
is that social distancing absolutely works to flatten the curve, 

185
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:55,110
but even small imperfections prolong the spread for a while.

186
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,530
Now let's look at that setup with 12 communities and travel between them.

187
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,998
By default I have it set so that every day each agent has a 

188
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:09,190
2% chance of traveling to the center of a different community.

189
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,659
Now let's try a run where once we hit 100 cases, 

190
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:18,730
we cut down that travel rate by a factor of 4, to only half a percent.

191
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,730
What would you predict is going to happen?

192
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,670
The honest answer is that it depends.

193
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,750
In some runs it doesn't make any difference, and the majority of every community gets it.

194
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,870
Other times there are a couple communities that end up unscathed.

195
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,788
In general, the earlier you turn on this effect, the more effective it is, 

196
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:59,502
but the takeaway here is that reducing contact between communities 

197
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:03,549
really has only a limited effect once those communities already have it, 

198
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:06,710
and as solutions go it's certainly not robust on its own.

199
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,359
As a side note, when we run these simulations with larger cities, 

200
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:17,330
which has the effect that city centers act like concentrated urban hubs, 

201
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,355
you can see how as soon as the infection hits one of these urban centers, 

202
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,150
it very quickly hits all of them.

203
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,670
And after that, it slowly spreads to the edges of each community.

204
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,950
Let's take a moment to talk about how to quantify this spread.

205
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,198
Consider one person with the disease, and then 

206
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,050
count how many people they infect while they have it.

207
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,139
The average for this count across everybody who's been 

208
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,610
sick is known as the effective reproductive number, or R.

209
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,893
A more commonly discussed number is R-naught, which is the value 

210
00:14:56,893 --> 00:15:00,650
of R in a fully susceptible population, like at the very beginning.

211
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,810
This is known as the basic reproductive number.

212
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,120
You may have noticed I have this little label on our simulations, 

213
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,157
and the way it's being calculated is to look at each individual who's currently 

214
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:17,134
infectious, count how many people they've infected so far, 

215
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:21,625
estimate how many they're going to infect in total based on the duration of the illness, 

216
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,190
and then average those numbers.

217
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,235
For example, in our first default simulation with no added spices, 

218
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:32,319
R is around 2.2 at the highest part of the growth phase, 

219
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:35,350
before falling down as the population becomes saturated.

220
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,310
By contrast, when we doubled the infection radius, R was as high as 8!

221
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,550
This factor has a huge effect on the growth rate.

222
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,590
It should kind of make sense that it jumped up as high as 8, though.

223
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,290
When you double that radius, there's about 4 times as many people inside it to infect.

224
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,810
When we chopped the infection rate in half, it hovered around the 1.3 to 1.7 range.

225
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,476
While R is greater than 1, the infection is growing exponentially, 

226
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:08,270
and it's at that point that it's known as an epidemic.

227
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,035
When it holds steady around 1, that's when a disease is called endemic, 

228
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,430
and less than 1 means it's on the decline.

229
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,707
For comparison, R0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be a little above 2, 

230
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:25,878
which is also around what the mean estimate for R0 was during the 1918 Spanish 

231
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:26,730
flu pandemic.

232
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,030
The seasonal flu by comparison is much lower, around 1.3.

233
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,976
In the travel case, as soon as we turn on social distancing and shut down travel, 

234
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:39,130
you can see R quickly drop down from 2.

235
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,024
There's a little bit of a lag between the change we make to the model and 

236
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:46,720
the value of this number, since it's calculated based on current infectious cases, 

237
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,570
which might have existed prior to the method being put in place.

238
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,780
Like I said at the start, one of the things I was most curious about is the 

239
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,530
effect of some kind of shared central location, like a market or a school.

240
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,609
When I introduce such a destination for our little dots, R0 jumps as high as 5.8.

241
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,442
This might be a little unfair, since it puts everyone right in the same spot, 

242
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:16,021
and given that we're using physical proximity as a stand-in for things 

243
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:19,601
like shaking hands or kissing, we should maybe acknowledge that people 

244
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:23,987
going to the same school or grocery store are not as likely to spread an infection as, 

245
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,710
say, close friends or people living in the same house.

246
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,864
To account for this, let's conservatively cut 

247
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:32,110
the probability of infection per day in half.

248
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,690
This does indeed cut R0 in half, but the effect of a central market remains dramatic.

249
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,504
Now let's try a run where after some threshold is hit, we turn on social distancing, 

250
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:54,170
but people still go to that central location the way they did before.

251
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,175
You may notice that some of our little dots seem to have escaped their little cage, 

252
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:09,147
which was not supposed to happen, but I'm going to make the conscious choice not to fix 

253
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:09,430
that.

254
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,750
It's like they all looked at the chaos inside and just went, 

255
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,890
nope, I'm out, I don't want any part of that.

256
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,012
Living in the Bay Area during a shelter-in-place order, 

257
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:20,290
I can confirm that this is how some people react.

258
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,270
Wandering dots aside, let me show you how this graph compares to the control case 

259
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,708
where we did nothing, and how it compares to what would have happened if in addition 

260
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:34,250
to repelling from each other, all the dots also stopped going to that central location.

261
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,942
The peak of the infection curve is a little lower than the control, 

262
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:42,247
but in terms of the total number of cases, keeping that central 

263
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:46,070
location active really defeats the effects of otherwise social distancing.

264
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,230
Now let me ask you to make a prediction.

265
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,110
What do you think will be more effective?

266
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,016
If on top of that social distancing effect, we decrease the frequency with 

267
00:18:57,016 --> 00:19:00,642
which people go to that central spot, maybe by a factor of 5, 

268
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:04,852
or if we chop the probability of infection down by another factor of 2, 

269
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:09,180
meaning people are super extra cautious about washing their hands and not 

270
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,350
touching their face.

271
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,479
The simulation on the left requires our dots to very heavily alter their daily routines, 

272
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:20,262
whereas on the right our dots can mostly continue their usual habits, 

273
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:22,370
but are much more conscious of hygiene.

274
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,744
They're actually nearly identical, which surprised me, 

275
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:31,610
given that one of them is a fivefold decrease and the other is twofold.

276
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,678
I guess it goes to show that the effect of hygiene, 

277
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:37,550
which is maybe easier said than done, really goes a long way.

278
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,090
Of course, it doesn't have to be an either-or.

279
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,250
Our goal with these experiments is to look at the effects of one change at a time.

280
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,605
If you're curious, here's what it looks like when we apply social distancing, 

281
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:53,480
we restrict the rate that people go to the central location, 

282
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,790
and we also lower the infection rate all at once.

283
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,530
This combination is, indeed, very effective.

284
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,081
But I want to emphasize again how the most desirable case 

285
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,510
is when you can consistently identify and isolate cases.

286
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,131
Even in this central market simulation, which left unchecked gives a huge conflagration, 

287
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,381
being able to do this effectively still halts the epidemic, 

288
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:22,986
and our little dots don't even have to be repelled by each other or stop their trips 

289
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,070
to the central spot.

290
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,388
In real epidemiology, by the way, it gets way more sophisticated than this, 

291
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:34,064
with tactics like contact tracing, where you not only identify and isolate known cases, 

292
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,890
but you do the same for everyone who's been in contact with those cases.

293
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,128
Given the time I'm posting this, I imagine there's some 

294
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:47,950
expectation for it to be a PSA on social distancing.

295
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,170
But to be honest, that's not really my own main takeaway.

296
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,463
To be clear, when it's needed, like it is now, social distancing absolutely saves lives, 

297
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,798
and as we saw earlier, when people cheat or when they continue to regularly meet at 

298
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,030
a central spot, it has a disproportionate effect on the long-term number of cases.

299
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,882
The uncomfortable truth, though, is that while the disease still exists, 

300
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,331
as soon as people let up and they go back to their normal lives, 

301
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:17,098
if nothing is in place to contain the cases, few though they might be, 

302
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:18,690
you'll just get a second wave.

303
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,698
After making all of these, what I came away with more than anything else was a deeper 

304
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:31,730
appreciation for disease control done right, for the inordinate value of early widespread 

305
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,370
testing and the ability to isolate cases, for therapeutics that treat these cases, 

306
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,290
and most importantly, for how easy it is to underestimate all that value when times are 

307
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,570
good.

308
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,820
I'm writing this during a pandemic, when some viewers may be able to identify 

309
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,550
a little too well with the trembling dots retreating to the edge of their box.

310
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,778
But in the future, many people will be watching this during a pandemic that never was, 

311
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:58,312
a time when a novel pathogen that could have spread widely if left 

312
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:00,950
unchecked was instead swiftly found and contained.

313
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,016
Those would-be pandemics never make it into the history books, 

314
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:08,690
which is maybe why we don't value the heroes behind them the way we should.

315
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,088
Living in a world with widespread travel and vibrant urban centers does make 

316
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:16,470
fighting the spread of a disease an uphill battle, that's absolutely true.

317
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,184
But that same level of connectedness means that ideas spread more quickly than ever, 

318
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:25,250
ideas that can lead to systems and technologies that nip these outbreaks in the bud.

319
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,546
It won't happen on its own, and it's clear that we sometimes make mistakes, 

320
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:33,290
but I'm fundamentally optimistic about our ability to learn from those mistakes.
