1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,460
I want to share with you a few simulations that model how an epidemic spreads.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,100
There have recently been a few wonderful interactive articles in this vein, including one in the

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,720
Washington Post by Harry Stevens, and then another by Kevin Simler over at Melting Asphalt.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,700
They are great, you can play with them, they're very informative, I'll of course leave links

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,340
in the description.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,600
After seeing those, I had a few more questions.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,520
Like if people stay away from each other, I get that that's going to slow down the

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:28,860
spread.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,340
But what if despite mostly staying away from each other, people still occasionally go to

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,320
a central location, like a grocery store or a school?

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,500
Also, what if you're able to identify and isolate the cases?

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,280
And if you can, what if a few slip through, say because they don't show symptoms so

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,980
they aren't tested?

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,220
How does travel between separate communities affect things?

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,960
And what if people avoid contact with each other for a while, but then they kind of get

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,160
tired and stop?

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,860
We'll explore these questions and more, but first let's walk through how exactly

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,040
these models will work.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,560
Each simulation represents what's called an SIR model, meaning the population is broken

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,980
up into three categories, those who are susceptible to getting the disease, those who are infectious,

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,780
and then those who have recovered from the infection, so people who are immune don't

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,460
play into it.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,240
The way I've written these, for every unit of time that a susceptible person spends within

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,180
a certain infection radius of someone with the disease, they'll have some probability

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,240
of contracting it themselves, so we're using physical proximity as a stand-in for things

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,440
like shaking hands, touching the same surface, kissing, sneezing on each other, all that

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,040
good stuff.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,280
Then for each infectious person, after some amount of time they'll recover and no longer

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,380
be able to spread the disease, or if they die they won't be able to spread it anymore,

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,340
so as a more generic term, sometimes people consider the R in SIR to stand for removed.

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,520
This should go without saying, but let me emphasize it at the start anyway.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,080
These are toy models, with a tiny population, inevitably falling far short of the complexities

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,040
in real people and larger populations.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,380
I am not an epidemiologist, so I would be very hesitant to generalize any of the lessons

35
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,260
here without deeper consideration.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,420
That said, I think it can be healthy to engage the little scientist inside all of us and

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,400
take the chance to be experimental and quantitative, even if it's in a necessarily limited fashion,

38
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,420
especially if the alternative is to dwell on headlines and uncertainty.

39
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,080
We'll start things simple and layer on more complexity gradually.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,940
In these first few runs that you're looking at, everybody is simply meandering around

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,940
the city in a kind of random walk, and the infection follows the rules we've laid out.

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,440
So it doesn't look great, after not too long almost everybody gets infected.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,640
As a sanity check, what would you expect to happen if I double this radius of infection?

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,420
You might think of this as representing more total interactions between people, or a more

45
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,720
socially engaged society.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,340
It'll spread more quickly, of course, but how much?

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,640
It's actually very drastic.

48
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,060
Within a short time span, the majority of our little population is infected simultaneously.

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,620
As another sanity check, what would you expect if we go back to the original infection radius,

50
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,800
and then cut the probability of infection in half?

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,740
Remember, the way this is running, for each day that a susceptible person is within that

52
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,720
radius of an infectious person, they have some probability of becoming infected.

53
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,420
By default I've set it to 20%, but this is the number we're now going to cut in half.

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,980
You might think of this as better hand washing, better cough protection, and less face touching.

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,100
As you might expect, it spreads out the curve.

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,820
In fact it does this by quite a lot, which really illustrates how changes to hygiene

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,260
have very large effects on the rate of spreading.

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,100
The first of several key takeaways here that I'd like you to tuck away in your mind is

59
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,860
just how sensitive this growth can be to each parameter in our control.

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,430
It's not that hard to imagine changing your daily habits in a way that multiplies the

61
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,050
number of people you interact with, or that cuts your probability of catching an infection

62
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,090
in half, but the implications for the pace of the spread are huge.

63
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,630
The goal is probably to reduce the total number of people who die, which is some proportion

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,870
of this removed category in the end.

65
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,750
That proportion is not a constant, though.

66
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,910
If you get to a point where the peak of the infection curve is too high, meaning there's

67
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,190
a time when many people are all sick at once, that's the point when available healthcare

68
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,870
resources are overwhelmed, which for a bad disease will increase the mortality rate.

69
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,710
Now I don't know where you're from, but in most towns people don't actually spend

70
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,230
their days drunkenly wandering around the city like this.

71
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,770
Often there's a common destination, like a central market or a school.

72
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,710
In our model, if we introduce some central spot like this that people regularly visit

73
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,470
and then return from, it'sâ€¦ well, just look.

74
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,990
One of the main things I was curious about is how to mitigate this effect, and that's

75
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,530
something we'll examine in just a bit.

76
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,650
Another feature we could include is to have a few separate communities with transit between

77
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,010
them.

78
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,150
Every day, each person will have some probability of traveling to the center of another community,

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,110
and then going about their usual routine from there.

80
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,790
All of that is our basic setup, so now the question is what actions help to stop this

81
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,230
spread?

82
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,050
What is by far most effective is to identify and isolate whoever is infectious, for example

83
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,870
with good testing and quick responsiveness.

84
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,850
In our simulations, once we hit some critical threshold of cases, we're going to start

85
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,930
sending people to a separate location one day after they have the infection.

86
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,650
This is of course a stand-in for whatever isolation would look like in the real world,

87
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,770
it doesn't have to literally be transporting all the sick people into one sad box.

88
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,350
Unsurprisingly, this totally halts the epidemic in its tracks.

89
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,130
But what if when you're infected you have a 20% chance of not getting quarantined, say

90
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,990
because you show no symptoms so you don't get tested, and you go about your day as usual?

91
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,730
We're going to illustrate these people that have no symptoms using yellow circles instead

92
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,190
of red.

93
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,990
Obviously this will have a result somewhere between a total quarantine and doing nothing,

94
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,990
but where on the spectrum would you predict it'll be?

95
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,170
The peak number of simultaneous cases is only a little bit higher, but there is a very low

96
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,630
long tail as it takes a much longer time to stamp out, resulting in about twice as

97
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,610
many total cases.

98
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,490
This gets more interesting when we do it in a setting with many communities and transit

99
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,190
between them.

100
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,650
Again, totally effective tracking in isolation stops the epidemic very quickly, but what

101
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,670
would you predict is going to happen if now 20% of the infectious cases slip through that

102
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,210
process?

103
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,610
Again, I've set things to wait until a certain critical threshold of cases is hit

104
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,730
before our little dot society kicks into gear and takes action.

105
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,430
As a side note, it's a little interesting that even when all the parameters are the

106
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,790
same, some runs take three times longer to reach this point than others.

107
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,050
Before the law of large numbers kicks in, that pace of growth can have as much to do

108
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,870
with the roll of the dice as it does with anything intrinsic to the disease itself.

109
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,150
This leaky quarantining effort definitely flattens out the curve, but it is a much thicker

110
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,870
tail and takes a much longer time to track down all the cases, with over half the population

111
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,510
getting infected this time.

112
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,690
Now, what would you predict if it was only 50% of the infectious cases that were isolated

113
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,390
like this?

114
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,470
If half the infectious people are getting quarantined, it doesn't mean that half the

115
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,390
total population will end up with the disease.

116
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,370
Because there are so many agents still out there spreading it, we end up with a situation

117
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,990
that's only barely better than if nothing had been done at all.

118
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,990
A second key takeaway here is that changes in how many people slip through the tests

119
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,630
can cause disproportionately large changes to the total number of people infected.

120
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,370
If we look back to the fact that quickly containing cases so early is so effective, it actually

121
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,750
has an interesting corollary, which is that the most lethal diseases are in some sense

122
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,170
less dangerous globally.

123
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,030
Remember that the rule of this quarantine simulation is to send infectious people to

124
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,850
a separate spot one day after they've been infected, but if the disease kills its host

125
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,790
after one day, the model looks identical, it just has a much darker interpretation.

126
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,450
It is terrible for those who get it, but it doesn't spread.

127
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,870
It also means that the most dangerous viruses are the ones that kill some part of the population

128
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,070
in the first place, while laying unnoticed and spreadable among others.

129
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,470
Or worse yet, if they remain unnoticed and spreadable in everyone before eventually becoming

130
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,830
lethal.

131
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,770
One of the reasons that the SARS outbreak in 2002 was so well contained is that just

132
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,870
about everybody in this infectious population was showing symptoms, so they were much easier

133
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,170
to identify and isolate.

134
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,250
A more optimistic corollary of these quarantine simulations is how useful early treatment

135
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,810
can be.

136
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,870
If there exists an antiviral therapeutic that can move people out of this infectious category

137
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,250
quickly, it has the same effect on the model as isolating those cases.

138
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,950
But let's say you don't have widespread testing or antiviral therapeutics.

139
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,670
Well, let's introduce a new parameter here, which is how much people try to avoid each

140
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,910
other.

141
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,270
Let's call it the social distance factor.

142
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,610
In these animations, I'll apply it as a repulsive force between people, and have them

143
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,530
glow yellow when they feel just a little too close to their neighbor.

144
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,150
This has the sad but kind of cute effect that when our little agents are social distancing,

145
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,910
they often end up trembling near the edge of their box.

146
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,690
No isolation is perfect, though, so every now and then even those repulsed by each other

147
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,970
will jiggle close enough to get infected.

148
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,090
The point is that those interactions are much rarer.

149
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,930
Let's take a look at four separate runs here.

150
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,130
In each one of them, after we hit 50 cases, I'll turn on social distancing.

151
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,210
But in the top left, we'll turn it on for everybody.

152
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,210
In the top right, we'll turn it on for 90% of the population.

153
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,910
In the bottom left, for 70% of the population, and in the bottom right, for only half the

154
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,430
population.

155
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,550
What would you predict is going to happen?

156
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,270
As you might expect, when 100% of people avoid each other, the disease quickly goes away,

157
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,930
entirely.

158
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,310
And in all four cases, the presence of some kind of widespread social distancing definitely

159
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,430
flattens out the curve.

160
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,290
However, in terms of the ultimate number of cases, the run with 70% and even the one with

161
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,790
90% end up with a little less than half the population ultimately getting infected, which

162
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,690
is only a tiny bit better than the one with 50%.

163
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,450
That case with 90% of people repelling each other certainly takes longer to get there,

164
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:15,330
but evidently a mere 10% of the population cheating adds enough instability to our system

165
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,410
to keep the fire slowly burning for a long time.

166
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,550
Again, I'll emphasize that these are toy models, and I leave it to the intelligence

167
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,910
of the viewer to judge if the behavior of these little dots accurately reflects what

168
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,530
social distancing would mean for you and your life.

169
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,690
Someone fully sequestered in their home is not necessarily affected by the random jiggling

170
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,410
of their neighbor, but then again, few of us genuinely live independently from everyone else.

171
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,930
Insofar as these models aren't outlandish, the third key takeaway is that social distancing

172
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,430
absolutely works to flatten the curve, but even small imperfections prolong the spread

173
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,110
for a while.

174
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,530
Now let's look at that setup with 12 communities and travel between them.

175
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,810
By default I have it set so that every day each agent has a 2% chance of traveling to

176
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,190
the center of a different community.

177
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,970
Now let's try a run where once we hit 100 cases, we cut down that travel rate by a factor

178
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,730
of 4, to only half a percent.

179
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,730
What would you predict is going to happen?

180
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,670
The honest answer is that it depends.

181
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,750
In some runs it doesn't make any difference, and the majority of every community gets it.

182
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,870
Other times there are a couple communities that end up unscathed.

183
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,690
In general, the earlier you turn on this effect, the more effective it is, but the takeaway

184
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,930
here is that reducing contact between communities really has only a limited effect once those

185
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,710
communities already have it, and as solutions go it's certainly not robust on its own.

186
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,050
As a side note, when we run these simulations with larger cities, which has the effect that

187
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,550
city centers act like concentrated urban hubs, you can see how as soon as the infection hits

188
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,150
one of these urban centers, it very quickly hits all of them.

189
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,670
And after that, it slowly spreads to the edges of each community.

190
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,950
Let's take a moment to talk about how to quantify this spread.

191
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,910
Consider one person with the disease, and then count how many people they infect while

192
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,050
they have it.

193
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,390
The average for this count across everybody who's been sick is known as the effective

194
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,690
reproductive number, or R. A more commonly discussed number is R-naught, which is the

195
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,650
value of R in a fully susceptible population, like at the very beginning.

196
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,810
This is known as the basic reproductive number.

197
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,570
You may have noticed I have this little label on our simulations, and the way it's being

198
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,430
calculated is to look at each individual who's currently infectious, count how many people

199
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,130
they've infected so far, estimate how many they're going to infect in total based on

200
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,190
the duration of the illness, and then average those numbers.

201
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,430
For example, in our first default simulation with no added spices, R is around 2.2 at the

202
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,350
highest part of the growth phase, before falling down as the population becomes saturated.

203
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,310
By contrast, when we doubled the infection radius, R was as high as 8!

204
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,550
This factor has a huge effect on the growth rate.

205
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,590
It should kind of make sense that it jumped up as high as 8, though.

206
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,290
When you double that radius, there's about 4 times as many people inside it to infect.

207
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,810
When we chopped the infection rate in half, it hovered around the 1.3 to 1.7 range.

208
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,550
While R is greater than 1, the infection is growing exponentially, and it's at that

209
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,270
point that it's known as an epidemic.

210
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,790
When it holds steady around 1, that's when a disease is called endemic, and less than

211
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,430
1 means it's on the decline.

212
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:22,450
For comparison, R0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be a little above 2, which is also around

213
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,730
what the mean estimate for R0 was during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

214
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,030
The seasonal flu by comparison is much lower, around 1.3.

215
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,250
In the travel case, as soon as we turn on social distancing and shut down travel, you

216
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,130
can see R quickly drop down from 2.

217
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,070
There's a little bit of a lag between the change we make to the model and the value

218
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,350
of this number, since it's calculated based on current infectious cases, which might have

219
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,570
existed prior to the method being put in place.

220
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,910
Like I said at the start, one of the things I was most curious about is the effect of

221
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,530
some kind of shared central location, like a market or a school.

222
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,610
When I introduce such a destination for our little dots, R0 jumps as high as 5.8.

223
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,410
This might be a little unfair, since it puts everyone right in the same spot, and given

224
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,350
that we're using physical proximity as a stand-in for things like shaking hands or

225
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,150
kissing, we should maybe acknowledge that people going to the same school or grocery

226
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,030
store are not as likely to spread an infection as, say, close friends or people living in

227
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,710
the same house.

228
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:32,110
To account for this, let's conservatively cut the probability of infection per day in half.

229
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,690
This does indeed cut R0 in half, but the effect of a central market remains dramatic.

230
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,170
Now let's try a run where after some threshold is hit, we turn on social distancing, but

231
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,170
people still go to that central location the way they did before.

232
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,510
You may notice that some of our little dots seem to have escaped their little cage, which

233
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,430
was not supposed to happen, but I'm going to make the conscious choice not to fix that.

234
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,070
It's like they all looked at the chaos inside and just went, nope, I'm out, I don't want

235
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,890
any part of that.

236
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,550
Living in the Bay Area during a shelter-in-place order, I can confirm that this is how some

237
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,290
people react.

238
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,750
Wandering dots aside, let me show you how this graph compares to the control case where

239
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,550
we did nothing, and how it compares to what would have happened if in addition to repelling

240
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,250
from each other, all the dots also stopped going to that central location.

241
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,610
The peak of the infection curve is a little lower than the control, but in terms of the

242
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,370
total number of cases, keeping that central location active really defeats the effects

243
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,070
of otherwise social distancing.

244
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,230
Now let me ask you to make a prediction.

245
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,110
What do you think will be more effective?

246
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,950
If on top of that social distancing effect, we decrease the frequency with which people

247
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,430
go to that central spot, maybe by a factor of 5, or if we chop the probability of infection

248
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:08,990
down by another factor of 2, meaning people are super extra cautious about washing their

249
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,350
hands and not touching their face.

250
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,710
The simulation on the left requires our dots to very heavily alter their daily routines,

251
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,810
whereas on the right our dots can mostly continue their usual habits, but are much more conscious

252
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,370
of hygiene.

253
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,230
They're actually nearly identical, which surprised me, given that one of them is a

254
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,610
fivefold decrease and the other is twofold.

255
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,130
I guess it goes to show that the effect of hygiene, which is maybe easier said than done,

256
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,550
really goes a long way.

257
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,090
Of course, it doesn't have to be an either-or.

258
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,250
Our goal with these experiments is to look at the effects of one change at a time.

259
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,150
If you're curious, here's what it looks like when we apply social distancing, we restrict

260
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,790
the rate that people go to the central location, and we also lower the infection rate all at once.

261
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,530
This combination is, indeed, very effective.

262
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,650
But I want to emphasize again how the most desirable case is when you can consistently

263
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,510
identify and isolate cases.

264
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,710
Even in this central market simulation, which left unchecked gives a huge conflagration,

265
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,690
being able to do this effectively still halts the epidemic, and our little dots don't

266
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,070
even have to be repelled by each other or stop their trips to the central spot.

267
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,090
In real epidemiology, by the way, it gets way more sophisticated than this, with tactics

268
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,830
like contact tracing, where you not only identify and isolate known cases, but you

269
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,890
do the same for everyone who's been in contact with those cases.

270
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,490
Given the time I'm posting this, I imagine there's some expectation for it to be a

271
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,950
PSA on social distancing.

272
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,170
But to be honest, that's not really my own main takeaway.

273
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,670
To be clear, when it's needed, like it is now, social distancing absolutely saves lives,

274
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,050
and as we saw earlier, when people cheat or when they continue to regularly meet at a

275
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,030
central spot, it has a disproportionate effect on the long-term number of cases.

276
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,030
The uncomfortable truth, though, is that while the disease still exists, as soon as people

277
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,290
let up and they go back to their normal lives, if nothing is in place to contain the cases,

278
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,690
few though they might be, you'll just get a second wave.

279
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,330
After making all of these, what I came away with more than anything else was a deeper

280
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,250
appreciation for disease control done right, for the inordinate value of early widespread

281
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,470
testing and the ability to isolate cases, for therapeutics that treat these cases, and

282
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,570
most importantly, for how easy it is to underestimate all that value when times are good.

283
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,510
I'm writing this during a pandemic, when some viewers may be able to identify a little

284
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,550
too well with the trembling dots retreating to the edge of their box.

285
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,150
But in the future, many people will be watching this during a pandemic that never was, a time

286
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,890
when a novel pathogen that could have spread widely if left unchecked was instead swiftly

287
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,950
found and contained.

288
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,370
Those would-be pandemics never make it into the history books, which is maybe why we don't

289
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,690
value the heroes behind them the way we should.

290
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,530
Living in a world with widespread travel and vibrant urban centers does make fighting the

291
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,470
spread of a disease an uphill battle, that's absolutely true.

292
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,110
But that same level of connectedness means that ideas spread more quickly than ever,

293
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,250
ideas that can lead to systems and technologies that nip these outbreaks in the bud.

294
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,170
It won't happen on its own, and it's clear that we sometimes make mistakes, but I'm

295
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,290
fundamentally optimistic about our ability to learn from those mistakes.

296
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,810
As you might imagine, these videos require a lot of hours of effort.

297
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,650
I don't do any ad reads at the end, and YouTube content related to the current pandemic seems

298
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,010
to be systematically demonetized, so I just want to take this chance to say a particularly

299
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,550
warm thank you to those who support them directly on Patreon.

300
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,270
It really does make a difference.
