1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
You walk alone into a room and find a chessboard.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Each of the 64 squares has a coin sitting on top of it.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,880
Taking a step back, this is one of those classic prisoner puzzles where a strangely math-obsessed

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,320
warden offers you and a fellow inmate a chance for freedom, but only if the two of you solve

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,980
some elaborate scheme they've laid out.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,000
In this case, what they've done is carefully turned over each of the coins to be heads

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,920
or tails according to whatever pattern they want it to be, and then they show you a key.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,680
They put that key inside one of the chessboard squares, each square is a secret compartment

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,060
or something like that, so you know where the key is.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,440
The goal is to get prisoner number 2 to also know where the key is, but the only thing

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,760
that the warden allows you to do before you leave the room is to turn over one and only

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,600
one of these coins.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,880
At that point, you walk out, your fellow prisoner walks in, and with no information other than

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,600
the set of heads and tails they're looking at, which you've only barely tweaked, they're

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,400
supposed to deduce where the key is hidden, potentially winning freedom for the both of you.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,520
As is typical with these puzzles, the two of you can strategize ahead of time if you

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,820
want, but you won't know what the specific layout of heads and tails is.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,360
And moreover, the warden can listen in on your strategy and do their absolute best to

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,120
thwart it with some adversarial arrangement of the coins and the key.

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,400
So, I first heard about this puzzle over dinner conversation at a wedding, and it totally

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
sucked me in.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,640
I remember the drive home was maybe 3 hours, and I think my mind was glued to the topic

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,160
of flipping coins and encoding state that whole time.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,480
But the puzzle sticks with you even after that.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,520
After I solved it, I fell into these two surprisingly interesting rabbit holes.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,680
One was to prove that the challenge is impossible if you vary the setup a little bit, maybe

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,240
making it a 6x6 chessboard, or removing one of the squares.

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,840
And to give you a little sense for where that rabbit hole leads, this video is going to

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,860
end with an especially pleasing way to paint the corners of a 4-dimensional cube.

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,700
The other rabbit hole was to work out how closely you can connect the solution of this

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,640
puzzle with error correction, which is a super important topic in computer science and information

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
theory.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,640
The idea is that when computers send and store data, the messiness of the real world inevitably

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,560
flips a bit now and then, and that can completely change how the data is read.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,700
So error correcting codes are a way to add a shockingly small amount of information to

36
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,400
a message that makes it possible for the receiver to identify both when there is an error, and

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,240
more impressively, precisely how to fix it.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,800
It turns out that the intuition for solving this puzzle is essentially the same as the

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,900
intuition behind these things called Hamming codes, which are one of the earliest examples

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,520
of highly efficient error correction.

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Which is all to say, time spent mulling over this problem is not as useless as you might

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
think it is.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,720
Now you and I aren't actually going to go through the solution here.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,320
Instead, I filmed a video all about that on stand-up maths with Matt Parker, who I'm

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,780
sure many of you recognize from his combined YouTube and stand-up and book fame.

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,100
We each talk through our thought process in solving it, and it's good fun, because there

47
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,240
are multiple ways of looking at it.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Instead, what I want to do with you here is take a more global view of every possible

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,400
strategy for this puzzle, and bring you with me down that first rabbit hole of proving

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,440
why certain variations necessarily leave room for the warden to thwart you, no matter how

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,160
clever you are.

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,040
The proof itself is one of those satisfying moments where you shift perspective and it

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,640
reveals the solution, and the whole context leading up to it is a nice chance to practice

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,520
reasoning about higher dimensional objects as a way to draw conclusions about information

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
and data.

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,200
Plus, it does more to help you appreciate the solution to the original puzzle when you

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:58,800
can see how it is, in a sense, almost impossible.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Where to start?

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,840
What we want is some kind of visualization for what it even means to solve this puzzle.

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,540
And to build up to the general case, let's knock things down to the simplest case we

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,300
can that still has any kind of meaning to it.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,260
Two squares, two coins, and two possibilities for where the key is.

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,720
One way you could solve this is to simply let the second coin communicate where the

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
key is.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,500
If it's tails, it means the key is in the left square, if it's heads, it means the

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,240
key is in the right square.

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Not a big deal, right?

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,980
It's one bit of information, so when you need to change that coin you can flip it,

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,460
but if you don't need to change it, you can just flip the other coin.

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,860
First things first, let's stop thinking about these as heads and tails and start thinking

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,500
of them as ones and zeros.

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,180
That's much easier to do math with.

73
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,460
Then you can think of these pairs of coins as a set of coordinates, where each of the

74
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,640
four possible states that the board can be in sit at the corners of a unit square, like

75
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,780
this.

76
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,380
This might feel like a silly thing to do when we already know how to solve this case, but

77
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,020
it's a good warmup for turning the larger cases into a kind of geometry.

78
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,220
Notice, flipping one of the coins moves you along an edge of the square, since it's

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,180
only changing one of the coordinates.

80
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,340
Our strategy of letting that second coin encode the key location could be drawn by associating

81
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:22,740
the bottom two corners, where the y-coordinate is 0, with the key is under square zero state,

82
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,380
which means those top two corners are associated with the key is under square one state.

83
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,180
So think about what it means for our solution to actually work.

84
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,340
It means that no matter where you start, if you're forced to take a step along an edge,

85
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,660
forced to flip one of the coins, you can always guarantee that you end up in whichever of

86
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,020
these two regions you want to.

87
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,440
Now the question is, what does it look like for a bigger chess board?

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,780
The next simplest case would be three squares, three coins, and three possibilities for where

89
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,860
the key is.

90
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,940
This gives us eight possible states that the coin can be in, and playing the same game

91
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,420
that we did before, interpreting these states as coordinates, brings us up into three-dimensional

92
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,460
space, with each state sitting at the corner of a unit cube.

93
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,040
The usefulness in a picture like this is that it gives a very vivid meaning to the idea

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,240
of turning over one of the coins.

95
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,020
Every time you flip a coin, you're walking along the edge of a cube.

96
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:29,920
Now, what would it mean for you and your fellow inmate to have a strategy for this puzzle?

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,580
Whenever prisoner 2 walks into that room, they need to be able to associate the state

98
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,360
that they're looking at, three bits basically, with one of three possible squares.

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,600
We're already thinking very visually, so let's associate those squares with colors, maybe

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,720
red for square zero, green for square one, and blue for square two.

101
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,180
In this conception, coming up with a strategy, any possible strategy, is the same thing as

102
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:01,980
coloring each of the eight corners of the cube, either red, green, or blue.

103
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,780
So for example, let's say you colored the whole cube red.

104
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,520
Well, I don't know if you'd call this a strategy exactly, but it would correspond with always

105
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,040
guessing that the key is under square zero.

106
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,260
Let's say instead your strategy was to add the first two coins together, and use that

107
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,660
as an encoding for the key location, well then the cube would look like this.

108
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,380
What's kind of fun is we can count how many total strategies exist, with three choices

109
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,820
for the color of each vertex and eight total vertices, we get 3 to the power 8.

110
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Or if you're comfortable letting your mind stray to the thought of painting a 64-dimensional

111
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,940
cube, you can have fun thinking about the sense in which there are 64 to the 2 to the

112
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,100
64 total possible strategies for the original puzzle.

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,700
This is the size of the haystack when you're looking for the needle.

114
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,840
Another attempt for the 3 square case might look like taking 0 times coin 0, plus 1 times

115
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,020
coin 1, plus 2 times coin 2, and then reduce that some mod 3 if you need to.

116
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,220
Over on Stand Up Maths, Matt and I both talk about trying a version of this for the 64

117
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,140
square case, and why it works decently well for a random arrangement of coins, but why

118
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,100
it's ultimately doomed.

119
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,760
From our view over here, it just looks like one more way to color the cube, but it's worth

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,660
taking a moment to walk through some of those corners.

121
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,240
Let's say you get into the room and all three coins are set to tails, so it's like you're

122
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,420
starting at the corner 0, 0, 0.

123
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,180
If you were to flip coin 0, that doesn't change the sum, so it takes you to another red corner.

124
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:40,100
If you flipped coin 1, it increases the sum by 1, so it takes you to a green corner.

125
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,860
And flipping coin 2 takes you up to 2, which looks like a blue corner.

126
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,900
The fact that you always have access to whichever color you want is a reflection of the fact

127
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,060
that this strategy will always win if this is the corner you're starting on.

128
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,460
On the other hand, let's say you started at 0, 1, 0.

129
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,460
In that case, flipping coin 0 takes you to another green corner, since it doesn't change

130
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:10,380
the sum, but flipping either coin 1 or coin 2 take you to a red corner.

131
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,500
There's simply no way to get to a blue corner.

132
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,060
Basically, what's happening here is that you have the options to subtract 1 by turning off coin 1,

133
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,660
or to add 2 by turning on coin 2, and if you're working mod 3, those are both actually the same operation.

134
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,020
But that means that there's no way to change the sum to be 2.

135
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,580
An adversarial warden who knows your strategy could start with this configuration,

136
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,140
put the key under square 2, and call it done.

137
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,340
But even without thinking about sums mod 3 or anything like that, whatever the implementation details,

138
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,500
you can see this in our picture, manifested as a corner that has two neighbors of the same color.

139
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,780
If you don't have a bird's eye view of all possible strategies, when you find that any specific one of them

140
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,340
just doesn't work, you're left to wonder, okay, maybe there's a sneaky clever strategy that I just haven't thought of yet.

141
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,780
But when we're thinking about colors on the cube, you're naturally led to an interesting combinatorial question.

142
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:14,460
Is there some way that you can paint this so that the three neighbors of any given vertex

143
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,340
always represent red, green, and blue?

144
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,660
Maybe it seems bizarre, even convoluted, to go from a puzzle with chessboards and coins

145
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,100
to talking about painting corners of a cube, but this is actually a much more natural step than you might expect.

146
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,020
I've talked with a lot of people about this puzzle, and what I love is that many of the experienced problem solvers

147
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,500
immediately jump, unprompted, to talking about coloring the corners of a cube,

148
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,580
as if it's a kind of de facto language for this puzzle. And it really is. Thinking about binary strings

149
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,580
as vertices of a high-dimensional cube with bit flips corresponding to edges, that actually comes up a lot,

150
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,980
especially in coding theory, like the error correction stuff I referenced earlier.

151
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:03,820
What's more, you often hear mathematicians talk about coloring things as a way to describe partitioning them into distinct sets.

152
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,380
If you've ever heard of that hilariously enormous number grams constant, for example,

153
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,540
the problem where that came up was also phrased in terms of assigning colors to a high-dimensional cube.

154
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,020
Though in that case colors were given to pairs of vertices instead of individual ones.

155
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,820
The point is, analyzing how to color a high-dimensional cube is more of a transferable skill than you might expect.

156
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,820
So to our question, can you make it so that every vertex has a red, a green, and a blue neighbor?

157
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,540
Remember, this is the same thing as having an encoding for key locations,

158
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,660
so that you're always one flip away from communicating whichever location you want to.

159
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,100
It would actually be enlightening if you paused the video and tried this now.

160
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,780
It's like a weird three-dimensional variant of a sudoku. Very similar to sudoku's, in fact,

161
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,660
in the sense that you want certain subsets to be filled with all three possible states.

162
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,540
For example, you might start by painting one of the corners an arbitrary color, let's say red,

163
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,340
and so you know that its three neighbors need to be red, green, and blue. Doesn't really matter how you do it.

164
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,860
And then maybe we move to the red neighbor and say that the other two adjacencies need to be green and blue.

165
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,500
Maybe we do it like this. But at least how I've drawn it here, you're stuck.

166
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,220
You are unable to choose a correct color for the next two. Can you see why?

167
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,060
What I'd like to share is a lovely little argument that explains not only why this will never work in three dimensions,

168
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,380
but also why it can't work in any dimension that's not a power of two.

169
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:38,540
The idea is that the symmetry in the property that we're looking at will end up implying that there have to be an equal number of red, green, and blue vertices.

170
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,260
But that would mean that there's eight-thirds of each, which is not possible.

171
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,700
And before I go on, pause, see if you can think of a way to solidify that intuition.

172
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,700
It's a fun exercise in turning a vague instinct into a solid proof.

173
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,740
Alright, you ready?

174
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,820
One way to do this is to imagine a process where you go through each corner and count how many of its neighbors are a particular color, say red.

175
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:14,380
So each step here, we're looking at the three neighbors of a given vertex, counting up the red ones, and adding that to a total tally.

176
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:27,180
For this specific coloring, that count came out to be 12, but if we had the property that we wanted, every corner would have exactly one red neighbor, so that count should be 8.

177
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:35,340
On the other hand, every red corner is counted exactly three times, once for each instance where it's somebody's neighbor.

178
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,820
So that final tally has to be three times the total number of red corners.

179
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,140
So, you know, it's simple. Find a coloring where eight-thirds of the corners are red.

180
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:56,060
Isn't that nice? Counting how many times some corner has a red neighbor is the same as counting how many times a red corner has some neighbor, and that's actually enough to get us a contradiction.

181
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,780
What's also nice is that this argument immediately generalizes to higher dimensions.

182
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,540
Think about solving the chessboard puzzle with n squares.

183
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,380
Again, the puzzle is to associate each arrangement of coins with some state, some possible location for the key.

184
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:22,060
And the goal is to make it so that the arrangements that you can get to with one flip of a coin represent all possible states, all possible places the warden might have hidden that key.

185
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:34,700
Even if you can't visualize most higher dimensional cubes, we can still talk about things like vertices of such a cube and their neighbors, basically as a way to describe bit strings and the ones which are one bit flip away.

186
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,980
Really, there's just two relevant facts you need to know.

187
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:49,020
If you're standing at one of these vertices, you have n distinct neighbors, and the total number of vertices is 2 to the n, one for each bit string of length n.

188
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,820
And from here, you can play the same game that we did in three dimensions.

189
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,020
You can go through each corner and count how many red neighbors it has.

190
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,420
If it's possible to do the coloring we want, this sum should be 2 to the n, one for each vertex.

191
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,700
On the other hand, each red corner is counted once for each of its neighbors,

192
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,180
so that means that we need to end up with n times the total number of red corners.

193
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,500
Since that left hand side is a power of 2, the right hand side also has to be a power of 2,

194
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,740
which could only ever happen if n itself is some smaller power of 2.

195
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,860
So for example, if we were in 4 dimensions or 64 dimensions, there is no contradiction.

196
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,180
It's at the very least possible to evenly divide the vertices among the different colors.

197
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,660
To be clear, that is not the same thing as saying there necessarily is a solution for the power of 2 case,

198
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,260
it's just that it can't be ruled out yet.

199
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,980
To me, this is completely delightful.

200
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,540
Just by imagining coloring the corners of a cube and then counting how many there are,

201
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,460
you can conclude that no possible strategy, no matter how clever you are,

202
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,660
can work in all of the cases for this chessboard puzzle, if the number of squares isn't a power of 2.

203
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,140
So even though it might seem to make it easier if you knock off a couple squares

204
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,660
or reduce the size of the board, it actually makes the task hopeless.

205
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,860
It also means that the solution to this puzzle, which I'll point you to in a moment,

206
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,820
can be viewed as a particularly symmetric way to color the corners of a high dimensional cube

207
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,220
in a way that's disallowed in most dimensions.

208
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,340
And if you're curious, I just couldn't resist showing this explicitly for a 4-dimensional cube.

209
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,700
So in the same way that you can take a 3D cube and kind of squish it down into two dimensions,

210
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,140
maybe with a little perspective, and get the same graph structure for how the vertices and edges are all connected,

211
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,020
we can do the same thing projecting a 4-dimensional cube into 3-dimensional space

212
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,580
and still get a complete view for how all of the vertices and edges are hooked together.

213
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,700
If you wanted to try your hand at a weird sort of 4-dimensional cousin of a Sudoku,

214
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,100
you could pause right now and try to figure out how to color these vertices

215
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,940
in such a way that each of the four neighbors of any one represent all four different colors.

216
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,460
Using essentially the same computation that solves the chessboard puzzle for the four-square case,

217
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,340
I can get the computer to explicitly draw that out for us.

218
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,140
And at this point, when you're hopefully burning to know what the actual solution is,

219
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,140
I'd like you to hop on over to Stand Up Maths, where Matt and I show you how it works.

220
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,100
If any of you are somehow not yet familiar with Stand Up Maths, it is one of my favorite channels,

221
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,740
run by one of my favorite people, so please do immediately subscribe once you land over there.

222
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,020
I promise, you're in for quite a few delights with everything else he has to offer.

223
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,020
Before explaining it, he and I simply walk through what it looks like for us to actually perform the solution.

224
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,620
And as we do, I really want you to try thinking of the solution yourself,

225
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,340
and to predict what it is that we're doing before we tell you.

226
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,060
And if you're curious about the connection with Hamming codes and error correction,

227
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm definitely game to make a video on that, just let me know in the comments.

228
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,660
I've been told that as far as motivating puzzles go, not everyone is as interested in symmetrical

229
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,500
ways to paint a 64-dimensional cube as I am. But reliable data transmission? Come on, I think we

230
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
can all agree that that's universally sexy.

231
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,980
Come on, I think we can all agree that that's universally sexy.

232
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,480
you
