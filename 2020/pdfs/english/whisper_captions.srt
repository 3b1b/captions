1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,680
Imagine you have a weighted coin, so the probability of flipping heads might not be 50-50 exactly.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:18,480
It could be 20%, or maybe 90%, or 0%, or 31.41592%.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,200
The point is that you just don't know.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,580
But imagine that you flip this coin 10 different times, and 7 of those times it comes up heads.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,020
Do you think that the underlying weight of this coin is such that each flip has a 70% chance of coming up heads?

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,620
If I were to ask you, hey, what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads is 0.7, what would you say?

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,220
This is a pretty weird question, and for two reasons.

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,120
First of all, it's asking about a probability of a probability,

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,520
as in the value we don't know is itself some kind of long-run frequency for a random event,

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,720
which frankly is hard to think about.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,280
But the more pressing weirdness comes from asking about probabilities in the setting of continuous values.

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,780
Let's give this unknown probability of flipping heads some kind of name, like h.

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,440
Keep in mind that h could be any real number from 0 up to 1,

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,320
ranging from a coin that always flips tails up to one that always flips heads and everything in between.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,340
So if I ask, hey, what's the probability that h is precisely 0.7,

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,220
as opposed to, say, 0.7000001, or any other nearby value,

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,160
well, there's going to be a strong possibility for paradox if we're not careful.

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,160
It feels like no matter how small the answer to this question, it just wouldn't be small enough.

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,720
If every specific value within some range, all uncountably infinitely many of them, has a non-zero probability,

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,020
well, even if that probability was minuscule, adding them all up to get the total probability of any one of these values

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,260
will blow up to infinity.

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,720
On the other hand though, if all of these probabilities are 0,

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,800
aside from the fact that that now gives you no useful information about the coin,

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,660
the total sum of those probabilities would be 0, when it should be 1.

25
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:16,440
After all, this weight of the coin h is something, so the probability of it being any one of these values should add up to 1.

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,220
So if these values can't all be non-zero, and they can't all be 0, what do you do?

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Where we're going with this, by the way, is that I'd like to talk about the very practical question of using data to create meaningful answers to these sorts of probabilities of probabilities questions.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,780
But for this video, let's take a moment to appreciate how to work with probabilities over continuous values, and resolve this apparent paradox.

29
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,960
The key is not to focus on individual values, but ranges of values.

30
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:02,160
For example, we might make these buckets to represent the probability that h is between, say, 0.8 and 0.85.

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,300
Also, and this is more important than it might seem,

32
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,500
rather than thinking of the height of each of these bars as representing the probability,

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,040
think of the area of each one as representing that probability.

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,480
Where exactly those areas come from is something that we'll answer later.

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,140
For right now, just know that in principle, there's some answer to the probability of h sitting inside one of these ranges.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,940
Our task right now is to take the answers to these very coarse-grained questions,

37
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,560
and to get a more exact understanding of the distribution at the level of each individual input.

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,980
The natural thing to do would be consider finer and finer buckets.

39
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,920
And when you do, the smaller probability of falling into any one of them

40
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,400
is accounted for in the thinner width of each of these bars,

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,920
while the heights are going to stay roughly the same.

42
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,220
That's important, because it means that as you take this process to the limit, you approach some kind of smooth curve.

43
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,700
So even though all of the individual probabilities of falling into any one particular bucket will approach zero,

44
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,220
the overall shape of the distribution is preserved, and even refined in this limit.

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,900
If, on the other hand, we had let the heights of the bars represent probabilities, everything would have gone to zero.

46
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,640
So in the limit, we would have just had a flat line giving no information about the overall shape of the distribution.

47
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,260
So, wonderful. Letting area represent probability helps solve this problem.

48
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,140
But let me ask you, if the y-axis no longer represents probability, what exactly are the units here?

49
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,060
Since probability sits in the area of these bars, or width times height,

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,640
the height represents a kind of probability per unit in the x-direction,

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,640
what's known in the business as a probability density.

52
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,540
The other thing to keep in mind is that the total area of all these bars has to equal one at every level of the process.

53
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,500
That's something that has to be true for any valid probability distribution.

54
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,300
The idea of probability density is actually really clever when you step back to think about it.

55
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,020
As you take things to the limit, even if there's all sorts of paradoxes associated with assigning a probability

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,460
to each of these uncountably infinitely many values of h between 0 and 1,

57
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,920
there's no problem if we associate a probability density to each one of them,

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,640
giving what's known as a probability density function, or PDF for short.

59
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,560
Anytime you see a PDF in the wild, the way to interpret it is that the probability of your random variable lying between two values

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,520
equals the area under this curve between those values.

61
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,460
So, for example, what's the probability of getting any one very specific number, like 0.7?

62
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,340
Well, the area of an infinitely thin slice is 0, so it's 0.

63
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,140
What's the probability of all of them put together?

64
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,960
Well, the area under the full curve is 1.

65
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,400
You see? Paradox sidestepped.

66
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,220
And the way that it's been sidestepped is a bit subtle.

67
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,260
In normal, finite settings, like rolling a die or drawing a card,

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,900
the probability that a random value falls into a given collection of possibilities

69
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,960
is simply the sum of the probabilities of being any one of them.

70
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,600
This feels very intuitive. It's even true in a countably infinite context.

71
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,540
But to deal with the continuum, the rules themselves have shifted.

72
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,660
The probability of falling into a range of values is no longer the sum of the probabilities of each individual value.

73
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,440
Instead, probabilities associated with ranges are the fundamental primitive objects,

74
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,600
and the only sense in which it's meaningful to talk about an individual value here

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,220
is to think of it as a range of width 0.

76
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,160
If the idea of the rules changing between a finite setting and a continuous one feels unsettling,

77
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,400
well, you'll be happy to know that mathematicians are way ahead of you.

78
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,640
There's a field of math called measure theory, which helps to unite these two settings

79
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,020
and make rigorous the idea of associating numbers like probabilities

80
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,140
to various subsets of all possibilities in a way that combines and distributes nicely.

81
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,720
For example, let's say you're in a setting where you have a random number that equals 0 with 50% probability,

82
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,880
and the rest of the time it's some positive number according to a distribution that looks like half of a bell curve.

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,760
This is an awkward middle ground between a finite context,

84
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,380
where a single value has a non-zero probability, and a continuous one.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,680
where probabilities are found according to areas under the appropriate density function.

86
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,600
This is the sort of thing that measure theory handles very smoothly.

87
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,120
I mention this mainly for the especially curious viewer, and you can find more reading material in the description.

88
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,400
It's a pretty common rule of thumb that if you find yourself using a sum in a discrete context,

89
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,140
then use an integral in the continuous context,

90
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,800
which is the tool from calculus that we use to find areas under curves.

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,040
In fact, you could argue this video would be way shorter if I just said that at the front and called it good.

92
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,280
For my part though, I always found it a little unsatisfying to do this blindly without thinking through what it really means.

93
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,940
And in fact, if you really dig into the theoretical underpinnings of integrals,

94
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,960
what you'd find is that in addition to the way that it's defined in a typical intro calculus class,

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,020
there is a separate more powerful definition that's based on measure theory, this formal foundation of probability.

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,080
If I look back to when I first learned probability,

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,780
I definitely remember grappling with this weird idea that in continuous settings,

98
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,200
like random variables that are real numbers or throwing a dart at a dartboard,

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,380
you have a bunch of outcomes that are possible, and yet each one has a probability of zero,

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,560
and somehow altogether they have a probability of one.

101
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,780
Now one step of coming to terms with this is to realize that possibility is better tied to probability density than probability,

102
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,820
but just swapping out sums of one for integrals of the others never quite scratched the itch for me.

103
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,000
I remember that it only really clicked when I realized that the rules for combining

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,240
probabilities of different sets were not quite what I thought they were, and there was simply a different axiom system underlying it all.

105
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,700
But anyway, steering away from the theory somewhere back in the loose direction of application,

106
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,440
look back to our original question about the coin with an unknown weight.

107
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,260
What we've learned here is that the right question to ask is,

108
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,960
what's the probability density function that describes this value h after seeing the outcomes of a few tosses?

109
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,120
If you can find that PDF, you can use it to answer questions like,

110
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,800
what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads falls between 0.6 and 0.8?

111
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,060
To find that PDF, join me in the next part.

112
