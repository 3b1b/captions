1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Imagine you have a weighted coin, so the probability of flipping heads might not be 50-50 exactly.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,660
It could be 20%, or maybe 90%, or 0%, or 31.41592%.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,840
The point is that you just don't know.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,260
But imagine that you flip this coin 10 different times, and 7 of those times it comes up heads.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,900
Do you think that the underlying weight of this coin is such that each flip has a 70%

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,820
chance of coming up heads?

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,660
If I were to ask you, hey, what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,940
is 0.7, what would you say?

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,900
This is a pretty weird question, and for two reasons.

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,940
First of all, it's asking about a probability of a probability, as in the value we don't

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,060
know is itself some kind of long-run frequency for a random event, which frankly is hard

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,460
to think about.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
But the more pressing weirdness comes from asking about probabilities in the setting

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,740
of continuous values.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,500
Let's give this unknown probability of flipping heads some kind of name, like h.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,340
Keep in mind that h could be any real number from 0 up to 1, ranging from a coin that always

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,000
flips tails up to one that always flips heads, and everything in between.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,680
So if I ask, hey, what's the probability that h is precisely 0.7, as opposed to, say,

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,200
0.700000001, or any other nearby value, there's going to be a strong possibility for paradox

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,920
if we're not careful.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,800
It feels like no matter how small the answer to this question, it just wouldn't be small

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
enough.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,340
If every specific value within some range, all uncountably infinitely many of them, has

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,580
a non-zero probability, even if that probability was miniscule, adding them all up to get the

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,900
total probability of any one of these values will blow up to infinity.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,540
On the other hand, if all of these probabilities are 0, aside from the fact that that now gives

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,540
you no useful information about the coin, the total sum of those probabilities would

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,680
be 0, when it should be 1.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,220
After all, this weight of the coin h is something, so the probability of it being any one of

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,500
these values should add up to 1.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:25,220
So if these values can't all be non-zero, and they can't all be 0, what do you do?

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,540
Where we're going with this, by the way, is that I'd like to talk about the very practical

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,320
question of using data to create meaningful answers to these sorts of probabilities of

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,760
probabilities questions.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,480
But for this video, let's take a moment to appreciate how to work with probabilities

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:49,840
over continuous values, and resolve this apparent paradox.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,660
The key is not to focus on individual values, but ranges of values.

38
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,460
For example, we might make these buckets to represent the probability that h is between,

39
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,760
say 0.8 and 0.85.

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,320
Also, and this is more important than it might seem, rather than thinking of the height of

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,300
each of these bars as representing the probability, think of the area of each one as representing

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,140
that probability.

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Where exactly those areas come from is something we'll answer later.

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,240
For right now, just know that in principle, there's some answer to the probability of

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,080
h sitting inside one of these ranges.

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,540
Our task right now is to take the answers to these very coarse-grained questions, and

47
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,660
to get a more exact understanding of the distribution at the level of each individual input.

48
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,720
The natural thing to do is to consider finer and finer buckets, and when you do, the smaller

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,640
probability of falling into any one of them is accounted for in the thinner width of each

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,240
of these bars, while the heights are going to stay roughly the same.

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,800
That's important because it means that as you take this process to the limit, you approach

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,980
some kind of smooth curve.

53
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,900
So even though all of the individual probabilities of falling into any one particular bucket

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,440
will approach 0, the overall shape of the distribution is preserved, and even refined

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,120
in this limit.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,960
If we had let the heights of the bars represent probabilities, everything would have gone

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,500
to 0.

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,120
So in the limit, we would have just had a flat line giving no information about the

59
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,540
overall shape of the distribution.

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,360
So wonderful, letting area represent probability helps solve this problem.

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,520
But let me ask you, if the y-axis no longer represents probability, what exactly are the

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,300
units here?

63
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,520
Since probability sits in the area of these bars, or width times height, the height represents

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,100
a kind of probability per unit in the x-direction, what's known in the business as a probability

65
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,660
density.

66
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,000
The other thing to keep in mind is that the total area of all these bars has to equal

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,760
1 at every level of the process.

68
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,260
That's something that has to be true for any valid probability distribution.

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,760
The idea of probability density is actually really clever when you step back to think

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
about it.

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,200
As you take things to the limit, even if there's all sorts of paradoxes associated with assigning

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,280
a probability to each of these uncountably infinitely many values of h between 0 and

73
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,520
1, there's no problem if we associate a probability density to each one of them, giving

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,520
what's known as a probability density function, or PDF for short.

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,760
Any time you see a PDF in the wild, the way to interpret it is that the probability of

76
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,820
your random variable lying between two values equals the area under this curve between those

77
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
values.

78
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,580
So, for example, what's the probability of getting any one very specific number, like

79
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
0.7?

80
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,640
Well, the area of an infinitely thin slice is 0, so it's 0.

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,440
What's the probability of all of them put together?

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,280
Well, the area under the full curve is 1.

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,720
You see?

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Paradox sidestepped.

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,760
And the way that it's been sidestepped is a bit subtle.

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,500
In normal, finite settings, like rolling a die or drawing a card, the probability that

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,440
a random value falls into a given collection of possibilities is simply the sum of the

88
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,920
probabilities of being any one of them.

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,220
This feels very intuitive, it's even true in a countably infinite context.

90
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,140
But to deal with the continuum, the rules themselves have shifted.

91
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,080
The probability of falling into a range of values is no longer the sum of the probabilities

92
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,460
of each individual value.

93
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,060
Instead, probabilities associated with ranges are the fundamental primitive objects, and

94
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,060
the only sense in which it's meaningful to talk about an individual value here is

95
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,260
to think of it as a range of width 0.

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,620
If the idea of the rules changing between a finite setting and a continuous one feels

97
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,580
unsettling, well you'll be happy to know that mathematicians are way ahead of you.

98
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,900
There's a field of math called measure theory which helps to unite these two settings and

99
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,900
make rigorous the idea of associating numbers like probabilities to various subsets of all

100
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,340
possibilities in a way that combines and distributes nicely.

101
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,500
For example, let's say you're in a setting where you have a random number that equals

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,220
0 with 50% probability, and the rest of the time it's some positive number according

103
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,860
to a distribution that looks like half of a bell curve.

104
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,320
This is an awkward middle ground between a finite context, where a single value has

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,400
a non-zero probability, and a continuous one, where probabilities are found according to

106
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,620
areas under the appropriate density function.

107
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,740
This is the sort of thing that measure theory handles very smoothly.

108
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,380
I mention this mainly for the especially curious viewer, and you can find more reading material

109
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,900
in the description.

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,820
It's a pretty common rule of thumb that if you find yourself using a sum in a discrete

111
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,860
context, then use an integral in the continuous context, which is the tool from calculus that

112
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,420
we use to find areas under curves.

113
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,820
In fact, you could argue this video would be way shorter if I just said that at the

114
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,800
front and called it good.

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,980
For my part though, I always found it a little unsatisfying to do this blindly without thinking

116
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,200
through what it really means.

117
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,920
And in fact, if you really dig into the theoretical underpinnings of integrals, what you'd find

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,500
is that in addition to the way that it's defined in a typical intro calculus class,

119
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,780
there is a separate, more powerful definition that's based on measure theory, this formal

120
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,180
foundation of probability.

121
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,460
If I look back to when I first learned probability, I definitely remember grappling with this

122
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,820
weird idea that in continuous settings, like random variables that are real numbers or

123
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,560
throwing a dart at a dartboard, you have a bunch of outcomes that are possible, and yet

124
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,260
each one has a probability of zero, and somehow all together they have a probability of one.

125
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,360
One step of coming to terms with this is to realize that possibility is better tied

126
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,420
to probability density than probability, but just swapping out sums of one for integrals

127
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,020
of the others never quite scratched the itch for me.

128
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,660
I remember that it only really clicked when I realized that the rules for combining probabilities

129
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,500
of different sets were not quite what I thought they were, and there was simply a different

130
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,680
axiom system underlying it all.

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,340
But anyway, steering away from the theory somewhere back in the loose direction of application,

132
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,700
let's look back to our original question about the coin with an unknown weight.

133
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,620
What we've learned here is that the right question to ask is, what's the probability

134
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,600
density function that describes this value h after seeing the outcomes of a few tosses?

135
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,620
If you can find that PDF, you can use it to answer questions like, what's the probability

136
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,820
that the true probability of flipping heads falls between 0.6 and 0.8?

137
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,020
To find that PDF, join me in the next part.
