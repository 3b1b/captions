1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,980
Imagine you have a weighted coin, so the probability 

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,680
of flipping heads might not be 50-50 exactly.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:18,480
It could be 20%, or maybe 90%, or 0%, or 31.41592%.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,200
The point is that you just don't know.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,609
But imagine that you flip this coin 10 different times, 

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,580
and 7 of those times it comes up heads.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,800
Do you think that the underlying weight of this coin is 

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,020
such that each flip has a 70% chance of coming up heads?

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,104
If I were to ask you, hey, what's the probability that the 

10
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:39,620
true probability of flipping heads is 0.7, what would you say?

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,220
This is a pretty weird question, and for two reasons.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,354
First of all, it's asking about a probability of a probability, 

13
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:51,894
as in the value we don't know is itself some kind of long-run 

14
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:55,720
frequency for a random event, which frankly is hard to think about.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,638
But the more pressing weirdness comes from asking 

16
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:01,280
about probabilities in the setting of continuous values.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,780
Let's give this unknown probability of flipping heads some kind of name, like h.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,155
Keep in mind that h could be any real number from 0 up to 1, 

19
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:16,015
ranging from a coin that always flips tails up to one that always flips heads and 

20
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:17,320
everything in between.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,715
So if I ask, hey, what's the probability that h is precisely 0.7, 

22
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:28,559
as opposed to, say, 0.7000001, or any other nearby value, well, 

23
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:34,160
there's going to be a strong possibility for paradox if we're not careful.

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,681
It feels like no matter how small the answer to this question, 

25
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,160
it just wouldn't be small enough.

26
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,602
If every specific value within some range, all uncountably infinitely many of them, 

27
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:48,709
has a non-zero probability, well, even if that probability was minuscule, 

28
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:53,427
adding them all up to get the total probability of any one of these values will blow 

29
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,260
up to infinity.

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,333
On the other hand though, if all of these probabilities are 0, 

31
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,855
aside from the fact that that now gives you no useful information about the coin, 

32
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:07,660
the total sum of those probabilities would be 0, when it should be 1.

33
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,763
After all, this weight of the coin h is something, 

34
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:16,440
so the probability of it being any one of these values should add up to 1.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,220
So if these values can't all be non-zero, and they can't all be 0, what do you do?

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,001
Where we're going with this, by the way, is that I'd like to talk 

37
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,349
about the very practical question of using data to create meaningful 

38
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,600
answers to these sorts of probabilities of probabilities questions.

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,205
But for this video, let's take a moment to appreciate how to work with 

40
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:42,780
probabilities over continuous values, and resolve this apparent paradox.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,960
The key is not to focus on individual values, but ranges of values.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,891
For example, we might make these buckets to represent the probability that h is between, 

43
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,160
say, 0.8 and 0.85.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,701
Also, and this is more important than it might seem, 

45
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:10,018
rather than thinking of the height of each of these bars as representing the probability, 

46
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:13,040
think of the area of each one as representing that probability.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,480
Where exactly those areas come from is something that we'll answer later.

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,175
For right now, just know that in principle, there's some answer 

49
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:24,140
to the probability of h sitting inside one of these ranges.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,382
Our task right now is to take the answers to these very coarse-grained questions, 

51
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:34,236
and to get a more exact understanding of the distribution at the level of each individual 

52
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:34,560
input.

53
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,980
The natural thing to do would be consider finer and finer buckets.

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,572
And when you do, the smaller probability of falling into any 

55
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:46,250
one of them is accounted for in the thinner width of each of these bars, 

56
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,920
while the heights are going to stay roughly the same.

57
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,382
That's important, because it means that as you take this process to the limit, 

58
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:55,220
you approach some kind of smooth curve.

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,769
So even though all of the individual probabilities of falling into 

60
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,465
any one particular bucket will approach zero, the overall shape 

61
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:07,220
of the distribution is preserved, and even refined in this limit.

62
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,061
If, on the other hand, we had let the heights of the bars represent probabilities, 

63
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,900
everything would have gone to zero.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,840
So in the limit, we would have just had a flat line giving 

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,640
no information about the overall shape of the distribution.

66
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,140
So, wonderful.

67
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,260
Letting area represent probability helps solve this problem.

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,463
But let me ask you, if the y-axis no longer represents probability, 

69
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:37,140
what exactly are the units here?

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,121
Since probability sits in the area of these bars, or width times height, 

71
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:46,443
the height represents a kind of probability per unit in the x-direction, 

72
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,640
what's known in the business as a probability density.

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,460
The other thing to keep in mind is that the total area of 

74
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,540
all these bars has to equal one at every level of the process.

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,500
That's something that has to be true for any valid probability distribution.

76
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,299
The idea of probability density is actually really 

77
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,300
clever when you step back to think about it.

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,077
As you take things to the limit, even if there's all sorts of paradoxes associated 

79
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:15,912
with assigning a probability to each of these uncountably infinitely many values of 

80
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:20,747
h between 0 and 1, there's no problem if we associate a probability density to each 

81
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:25,640
one of them, giving what's known as a probability density function, or PDF for short.

82
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,120
Anytime you see a PDF in the wild, the way to interpret it is 

83
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,879
that the probability of your random variable lying between two 

84
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,520
values equals the area under this curve between those values.

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,460
So, for example, what's the probability of getting any one very specific number, like 0.7?

86
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,340
Well, the area of an infinitely thin slice is 0, so it's 0.

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,140
What's the probability of all of them put together?

88
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,960
Well, the area under the full curve is 1.

89
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,920
You see?

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,400
Paradox sidestepped.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,220
And the way that it's been sidestepped is a bit subtle.

92
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,167
In normal, finite settings, like rolling a die or drawing a card, 

93
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:08,294
the probability that a random value falls into a given collection of 

94
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:12,960
possibilities is simply the sum of the probabilities of being any one of them.

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,020
This feels very intuitive.

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,600
It's even true in a countably infinite context.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,540
But to deal with the continuum, the rules themselves have shifted.

98
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,239
The probability of falling into a range of values is no 

99
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,660
longer the sum of the probabilities of each individual value.

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,100
Instead, probabilities associated with ranges are the fundamental primitive objects, 

101
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,267
and the only sense in which it's meaningful to talk about an individual 

102
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:41,220
value here is to think of it as a range of width 0.

103
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,362
If the idea of the rules changing between a finite setting and a continuous one feels 

104
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:50,400
unsettling, well, you'll be happy to know that mathematicians are way ahead of you.

105
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,212
There's a field of math called measure theory, 

106
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,387
which helps to unite these two settings and make rigorous the idea of associating 

107
00:06:57,387 --> 00:07:01,510
numbers like probabilities to various subsets of all possibilities in a way that 

108
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,140
combines and distributes nicely.

109
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,916
For example, let's say you're in a setting where you have a random number 

110
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,636
that equals 0 with 50% probability, and the rest of the time it's some 

111
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:15,880
positive number according to a distribution that looks like half of a bell curve.

112
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,093
This is an awkward middle ground between a finite context, 

113
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:24,380
where a single value has a non-zero probability, and a continuous one.

114
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,680
where probabilities are found according to areas under the appropriate density function.

115
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,600
This is the sort of thing that measure theory handles very smoothly.

116
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,557
I mention this mainly for the especially curious viewer, 

117
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:38,120
and you can find more reading material in the description.

118
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,207
It's a pretty common rule of thumb that if you find yourself using a 

119
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:48,108
sum in a discrete context, then use an integral in the continuous context, 

120
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:51,800
which is the tool from calculus that we use to find areas under curves.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,540
In fact, you could argue this video would be way shorter 

122
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,040
if I just said that at the front and called it good.

123
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,542
For my part though, I always found it a little unsatisfying to 

124
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,280
do this blindly without thinking through what it really means.

125
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,131
And in fact, if you really dig into the theoretical underpinnings of integrals, 

126
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:11,676
what you'd find is that in addition to the way that it's defined in a 

127
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:15,474
typical intro calculus class, there is a separate more powerful definition 

128
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:19,020
that's based on measure theory, this formal foundation of probability.

129
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,072
If I look back to when I first learned probability, 

130
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:27,476
I definitely remember grappling with this weird idea that in continuous settings, 

131
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:31,719
like random variables that are real numbers or throwing a dart at a dartboard, 

132
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,296
you have a bunch of outcomes that are possible, 

133
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:38,539
and yet each one has a probability of zero, and somehow altogether they have a 

134
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,559
probability of one.

135
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,802
Now one step of coming to terms with this is to realize that possibility is 

136
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:47,579
better tied to probability density than probability, 

137
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,457
but just swapping out sums of one for integrals of the others never quite 

138
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:52,820
scratched the itch for me.

139
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,615
I remember that it only really clicked when I realized that the rules for 

140
00:08:56,615 --> 00:09:00,355
combining probabilities of different sets were not quite what I thought they were, 

141
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:03,240
and there was simply a different axiom system underlying it all.

142
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,440
But anyway, steering away from the theory somewhere back in the loose direction of 

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
application, look back to our original question about the coin with an unknown weight.

144
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,564
What we've learned here is that the right question to ask is, 

145
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:21,506
what's the probability density function that describes this value h after seeing the 

146
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:22,960
outcomes of a few tosses?

147
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,371
If you can find that PDF, you can use it to answer questions like, 

148
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:32,099
what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads falls between 

149
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:32,800
0.6 and 0.8?

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,060
To find that PDF, join me in the next part.
