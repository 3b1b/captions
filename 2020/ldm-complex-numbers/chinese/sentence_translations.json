  "input": "Okay this is this isn't necessarily a question I was expecting to divide the audience necessarily so unsurprisingly it looks like we have a very strong majority in one direction hopefully in the correct direction but if not that would that would heavily inform where the lesson should go so that would be quite useful and I think that's probably enough time so I'm going to go ahead and lock the answers into this one okay and it looks like the majority of you answered negative two plus three i which is absolutely correct absolutely correct so there's two ways to think about this okay one of them is to walk forward with the algebra and just do it a little bit mechanistically okay so if we pull ourselves up our sheet if we take i times three plus two i three plus two i it just distributes i times three is going to be three i i times two i is going to be two times i squared by definition i squared is negative one which means that our final answer is going to look like negative two plus three i okay and like I said it looks like a majority of you correctly did that product now it's one thing to just walk through it mechanistically it's another to step back and say what just happened geometrically right because what we just talked through was the fact that if you want to rotate numbers 90 degrees the rule is to swap the two coordinates and then multiply that first one by negative two well look at what's happened here we've got three and two those coordinates have been swapped two is now the real part three is the imaginary part but that two got multiplied by a negative one because i has this defining feature of squaring to become negative one so that should give you some indication that okay multiplying by i has this action of rotating things by 90 degrees maybe that means that it's not a crazy thing to do to geometrically position i at a 90 degree angle with the real number line okay now to really see why that ends up being useful it turns out that if you have that if you have a number that behaves this way it gives you a computational mechanism for all of the other types of rotations that you might want to do that might not necessarily be 90 degrees and to show you why this works i'm going to go ahead and pull up an animation so let's say we have any number z and in this case z is going to be let's see where do i have it z is going to be at two uh plus i great and let's say i want to understand what is multiplying by z due to every other possible complex number well we can go one by one the very first one that's relatively simple is if i ask what is z times one where does it take the number one well z times one is going to be z so we're going to take the number one which i might draw with a little yellow arrow and we're going to rotate and stretch that arrow up to the point where z is great a kind of trivial fact even though it's trivial i'm actually going to take a moment to write that down just so that we can oh no no no that's for that's for later that is randy don't you guys worry about him he'll be coming in in just a moment so i just want to write down three crucial facts that are getting an influence rotation three facts i'll call it three facts about multiplication the first two are going to look simple the third one is going to look innocuous but it ends up being extremely constraining so the first one is that if i have any number z and i multiply it by one will i get the number z back okay geometrically that means with that we stretch and rotate that vector one to get what we want the second one is that if i take z times i from what we just talked about that is the 90 degree rotation what i might write is like rotate by 90 degrees the number z okay so often our animation what does that look like let's see we've already multiplied by one we take i and then it's going to move to whatever the 90 degree rotation point for z itself is okay so two down infinitely many to go okay we know what it does to one we know what it does to i let's see if we can understand what z does to any other possible number well it turns out those two is really all we need to work with if we have the distributive property so the third fact that's going to look kind of innocuous is let's say i take this z and i multiply it by c plus d times i where c and d are just any two numbers okay well this is going to distribute so z times c i'm actually going to write that a little differently i'm going to write it as c times z plus z times di which again i'm going to write in kind of a funny order and write that as d times z i now the idea here is well we know where z is we also know where z times i is so if we're just scaling them up by some other constants that completely constrains where we need to go so let me go ahead and write this down with an example okay let's say that we go back here and i want to know what multiplying by z does to anything i want to tell i want to convince you that it rotates all of the grid in a way that keeps these lines parallel it keeps them evenly spaced keeps them perpendicular to each other it applies this very constrained rule to the whole plane and really just think through any one particular point for this let's say that we have two times negative i okay so you move two units in the positive right direction and then negative one unit in the vertical direction well after the product where that's going to land has to be two times wherever z lands plus negative one times wherever i lands okay and we see that right it's two times this yellow vector and it'll be negative one times the green vector so here even before you actually work out the product we could just read off the fact that z here which looks like it's two plus i multiplied by two minus i must land on the number five okay so i actually want you guys to work this out algebraically because i do think that it's it's edifying to see this work in practice right the fact that we have this geometric rule where we're just kind of stretching and rotating and this corresponds to an otherwise very mechanistic process of expanding out a sum so let's pull back our quiz and i'm going to it's a little bit silly because i've revealed the answer but what i actually want you guys to do here is take a look at the question which says what is two plus i times two minus i and if you have notes right now if you have a pencil and paper which i encourage you to always come to class with i want you to try working it out do the first inside outside last distribution property just to see mechanistically what number ends up popping out from this and then we'll try to see how that squares with the geometric intuition so while you're doing that while you're working that out hopefully on pencil and paper it looks like we've got a question from the audience which is is i the same as i and j the vectors in physics great question actually that's that's a much more interesting question than you might think it is the short answer is no so in physics you often describe the right word direction as i and then the up and down direction as oh we got another one here let me finish answering the question first so in physics you often have this situation where instead of describing the xy plane you describe the right vector as i sometimes i hat and the vertical one as j hat so that's a separate thing that's uh how physicists will describe the right direction up direction for vectors they're not necessarily describing complex numbers totally separate thing what's more interesting actually is that the reason that convention came about uh i believe has to do with a number system that extends even beyond complex numbers it's called the quaternions so with the complex numbers we introduce something called i with the quaternions we introduce j and k these two other numbers both of which also have squares to negative one as it happens and the guy who invented them hamilton he was trying to describe three dimensional space very elegantly and using the purely imaginary directions i j and k became a nice way to do that and i think it's because of that and his attempts to push that forward that the conventions slipped into uh normal physics to just describe those as i and j of course that leads to serious confusion now because if we look at how physicists think of things you know i is in the right direction j is in the vertical direction but with complex numbers i is of course in the vertical direction so it just makes for a whole potential mess um now what was our oh no it looks like they took away the comment oh man there was a comment giving them some sass and then they got embarrassed so they pulled it away well it's on screen it's in there for everyone in the future to see now i think that's probably been enough time to work through a little bit of algebra here so let's go ahead and grade it for everyone to see and it looks like the vast majority of you well i told you the answer so i'm going to assume the vast majority of you are giving the correct answer oh interesting okay so it looks like uh five five is correct and that's the most common answer but then the ones uh where missed were three and four and maybe we can try to understand why three and four would have been common um misconceptions on this one 69 is close 0 i plus 5 is correct but i guess just uh formatted in a weird way um so let's let's go ahead and work this one out by hand okay it's actually you know kind of a pleasant process to multiply complex numbers because it's so deterministic you know what you have to do you know where you start you know where you're going to end and it's really just kind of practicing through it um so two times two that's the first thing that we get and then you take the inside parts i times two so that's going to be 2i and then the outside parts which is negative i times two so that's negative 2i and then the last part which is i times negative i so that'll be negative i squared the defining feature remember is that i squared is the same as negative one which means that the real component of our answer is going to be two times two or four now minus negative one which is plus one so that'll be five and then the imaginary parts cancel each other out that 2i cancels out with a negative 2i so to everyone on the quiz who answered uh five plus zero i uh you know extra credit to you because that actually is 100 correct you're even emphasizing that we're doing this in a complex context so there's no reason that you should have been graded incorrectly on that one um however what's uh what's interesting here those of you who watch the very first lecture might notice the similarity with difference of squares and this is effectively a difference of squares type question and i'm going to guess that those of you who answered three or four it probably came down to if you answered three it would have been because you took this four and you subtracted one rather than subtracting negative one very common mistake no harm in that and then if you answered four it comes from forgetting the fact that i squared can be simplified into a real number so that you know that very much counts for the the real component of your final answer now what's interesting i think is that that process of just walking through the algebra feels very different from this geometric idea that we had before of saying multiplying by z has the action of rotating and stretching things and how it rotates and stretches things is in the way that's necessary to get the number one to sit on the number z and in fact i have a i have a good friend uh ben sparks who is a frequent number file uh contributor that some of you might recognize and i asked him uh to whip up a little geogra thing because he's just a geogra whiz and he actually created basically the complex number equivalent of a slide rule that we can play with here so the way that this is going to work is that i can take the number one and sort of drag it around the plane and as i do the rest of the grid moves in the way that it has to so that the origin stays fixed in place and then everything else kind of stays rigid with the exception of being able to stretch so the way that you might use this is to say let's say we want to know what z times w is well i'm going to stretch and rotate the number one so that it lands on z and then i'm going to follow what happens to w which is now drawn as a orange vector follow what happens to w and as it lands there we can just read off that it ends up at five now even though in practice computationally you would be working it out with the algebra like we just showed having in the back of your mind that this is how they operate helps draw the connection between complex numbers and geometry and also trigonometry which we'll get to in a moment and that turns out to be a much more helpful connection than you might expect so let me go ahead and ask you guys a second question here which is bring back our helpful little friendly quiz given what i just told you about how complex numbers act i want you to guess for me it's okay if you don't know it's okay if you just want to hazard a guess here what is the complex number z so that multiplying by z has the effect of rotating 30 degrees or pi sixth radians counterclockwise okay so you want to number z so that when it's being applied as an action and you're saying what do you do to all the other possible complex numbers the corresponding action is to rotate by pi six radians or 30 uh 30 degrees okay great we've got a lot of answers coming in strong consensus around one of them which is always a good sign let me show you uh how i might draw this out um if i were doing things so i would take a look at um a unit circle of some kind and luckily i have my infinite supply of unit circles sitting right here and i would say okay i know that the action that i want is going to be whatever takes the number one to something that's the 30 degree rotation of the number one that sits up here whatever complex number z this is is going to have the appropriate action and then from there it's all of the trigonometry that you and i were working through last time so let's look at our answers and let's go ahead and lock them into place now before we talk through the explanation and the correct answer in this context is d which is cosine of pi six plus i sine of pi six congratulations to the uh majority of you who correctly answered that very interesting to me actually is that the second most common answer was a which is one plus pi six um and i think that's that's an utterly reasonable guess actually and let's take a look at why so if we go back to our our friendly unit circle the number we were going for is uh like i said sitting pi six radians around and from everything we talked about last time the x component of that is the cosine of pi six this is sort of how cosine is defined and then the y component of that is going to be sine of pi six which means that that number z that we're dealing with okay is going to have an x component of cosine of pi six and then an imaginary component what's in the y direction of sine of pi six great now that second most common answer like i said that's very interesting um if we pull it up it was a which was one plus pi six over i let's take a look at where that sits with a i'll bring in a second cleaner unit circle here like i said i've got an infinite supply they were guessing that it's one and that instead of walking pi six around that you walk to straight up pi six okay which is actually quite close right especially for small angles if you're just walking straight up that's not too different from walking around the circle so if you were to try to use that number um to have the action of rotating by 30 degrees it would have an action of rotating by something that's slightly less than 30 degrees and they would stretch things out by something that's slightly more than a factor of one but it's actually close um which is cool because usually the misconceptions might be like very wrong computationally but the idea that the uh the misconception here was like computationally quite close indicates that maybe the geometric reasoning was lining up with truth which i think is awesome so to give you an illustration of how this might actually be used okay we have a number that has this action of a 30 degree rotation um i want to bring in uh of course a friendly pi creature for us to all think about brandy so let's say that i have a pi creature and i'm i don't know animating a video and at some point for whatever reason i want that pi creature to rotate 30 degrees okay i just want them to rotate there's lots of ways you could do this one of the most common ones in computer graphics is to use matrices which might be a whole topic for another day but a tactic you could use is to use complex numbers and the way this would work is to think of our pi creature as living in the complex plane and then at any kind of computer graphics it's always defined with various points often these control points around it and each one of those control points i would give complex coordinates to so for example let's say the the lower right foot here or i guess stage left our right looks like it has coordinates about one negative three so that would be given the number one minus three i and then from what you guys just told me in answering the question if we want to take that point and then figure out where it gets when we rotate 30 degrees about the origin what i should be multiplying it by is cosine of 30 degrees by sine of 30 degrees and if ever you wanted to be convinced that complex numbers are just as real as real numbers i think one factor to consider is that many programming languages have built into them complex numbers they are considered as real as real numbers so what i might do i could pull up a little python terminal for us to play with and complex numbers if i write something like three negative one are considered a valid type in this case they use j um i think basically because in programming parlance i is often used as an indexing variable so they just go with j instead that actually matches with electrical engineering convention too where they instead of using i for the imaginary number they use j because again i was kind of already used so three minus one j you can just read that as being the same as three minus one i and i can take this number and i can multiply it by other complex values i don't know like five four two if i multiply that it's going to apply the rules of complex multiplication which basically is just foiling it out you can think of this as being the real part is three times four or 12 minus negative one times two because remember that i squared gives us that negative so that's where the 14 comes from and then the imaginary part is going to be that negative one times four which is negative four plus three times two which indeed works out to two so that's kind of cool python seems to be working all of this out for us and what that means remember is let's say that we wanted to rotate our pi creature and let's say i'm just going to focus on one point like his foot sitting here which is at one negative three so let's say i define the foot to be uh sitting at real part one imaginary part negative three uh the rotating number that i want z is what you guys figured out for me we're going to need a little math for this so let's import math always a sign that you're about to have some fun so we're going to call z a complex number whose real part is the cosine well i can't write 30 degrees because this will all be in radians so i'll write it as pi six that's the same thing as 30 degrees and then the y is going to be the sine of that sine of math dot pi over six great so if we look at its components uh the real part is around 0.",

正确的绝对正确所以有两种方法来思考这个问题，其中之一是继续 学习代数，只是稍微机械地做一下，好吧，如果我们把自己拉起来 ，如果我们取 i 乘以三加二 i 三加二 i 它只是分配 i 乘以三将是三 ii 乘以二 根据定义，我将是我平方的两 倍 我的平方是负一，这意味着我们的最终答案将看起来像负二加 三 我好的，就像我说的看来你们中的大多数人现在都正确地完成 了该产品，只是机械地浏览它是一回事，退后一步并说出几何上刚刚 发生的事情是另一回事，因为我们刚刚讨论的是这样一个事实：如 果你想将数字旋转 90规则是交换两个坐标，然后将第一个乘以 负二，看看这里发生了什么，我们有三个和两个坐标已交换，两个 现在是实部，三个是虚部，但是两个被乘以负数，因为 i 具有 平方变成负数的定义特征，所以这应该给你一些指示，好的乘以 i 具有将物体旋转 90 度的作用，也许这意味着这不是一件 疯狂的事情在几何上将 i 与实数轴成 90 度角，现在可以 真正了解为什么这最终是有用的，事实证明，如果你有一个数字， 如果你有一个以这种方式表现的数字，它会给你一个计算机制您可 能想要执行的其他类型的旋转可能不一定是 90 度，为了向您 展示为什么这是有效的，我将继续并拉出一个动画，所以假设我们 有任何数字 z，在本例中z 将是 让我们看看我在哪里 z 将是 2 呃加上我很棒，假设我想了解由于每个其他可能的复数而 与 z 相乘的结果，我们可以一一进行第一个相对简单的是，如 果我问 z 乘以 1 是多少，那么在哪里可以得到数字 1 z 乘以 1 将是 z 所以我们将取数字 1，我可以用一个 小黄色箭头绘制我们将旋转并拉伸那个箭头直到 z 是一个伟大 的点，这是一个微不足道的事实，尽管它很微不足道，我实际上会 花点时间写下来，这样我们就可以哦不不不那是为了以后的事，兰 迪，你们不用担心他吗，他一会儿就会进来，所以我只想写下三个 关键事实，这些事实正在获得影响力轮换三个事实，我称之为三个 事实关于乘法的事实，前两个看起来很简单，第三个看起来无害， 但它最终会受到极大的限制，所以第一个是，如果我有任何数字 z 并且我将它乘以一，我会得到数字 z从几何角度来说，这意 味着我们拉伸并旋转该向量，第一个向量可以得到我们想要的第二 个向量是，如果我从我们刚才讨论的z乘以i，那就是90度旋转， 我可能会写成旋转90 度数字 z 好吧，我们的动画通常看起 来是什么样子，让我们看看我们已经将 i 乘以 1，然后它将 移动到 z 本身的 90 度旋转点，所以 2 向下无限多好 吧，我们知道它对 1 有何作用，我们知道它对 1 有何作用 ，让我们看看我们是否能够理解 z 对任何其他可能的数字的作 用，事实证明，如果我们有分配律，那么这两个实际上就是我们需 要处理的全部所以第三个看起来无害的事实是，假设我取这个 z 并将其乘以 c 加 d 乘以 i，其中 c 和 d 是任 意两个数字，好吧，这将分布所以 z 乘以 c i实际上我会 写得有点不同，我会把它写成 c 乘以 z 加 z 乘以 d i，我又会以一种有趣的顺序写成 d 乘以 zi 现在的想法 在这里很好，我们知道 z 在哪里，我们也知道 z 乘以 i 在哪里，所以如果我们只是通过一些其他常数来放大它们，这些常 数完全限制了我们需要去的地方，所以让我继续用一个例子写下来 ，好吧，让我们说我们回到这里，我想知道乘以 z 对我想告诉 的任何事情有什么作用我想说服你它以保持这些线平行的方式旋转 所有网格它使它们均匀间隔保持它们垂直彼此之间，它将这一非常 受限的规则应用于整个平面，并且实际上只需考虑任何一个特定点 ，假设我们有两次负值，我可以，所以你向正方向移动两个单位， 然后向负方向移动一个单位产品落地后的垂直方向必须是 z 落 地的两倍加上 i 落地的负一倍，我们看到右边它是黄色向量的 两倍，并且它将是绿色向量的负一倍所以，在你真正算出乘积之前 ，我们可以读出这样一个事实：z 看起来像是 2 加我乘以 2 减我必须落在数字 5 好吧，所以我实际上希望你们用代数 的方式解决这个问题因为我确实认为在实践中看到这项工作是有启 发性的，因为我们有这样的几何规则，我们只是拉伸和旋转，这对应 于一个非常机械的扩展总和的过程，所以让我们拉回到我们的测验 ，我要说这有点傻，因为我已经透露了答案，但我实际上希望你们 在这里做的是看一下这个问题，这个问题说的是 2 加 i 乘 以 2 减 i 和如果你现在有笔记，如果你有铅笔和纸，我鼓 励你总是带着它来上课，我希望你尝试解决这个问题，做第一个内 部外部最后一个分布属性，只是为了机械地看看最终会弹出什么数 字然后我们会尝试看看它如何与几何直觉相一致，所以当你这样做 的时候，当你希望在铅笔和纸上解决这个问题时，看起来我们从观 众那里得到了一个问题，那就是i 与 i 和 j 相同，物理 学中的向量，很好的问题，实际上，这是一个比您想象的更有趣的 问题，简短的答案是不是，所以在物理学中，您经常将正确的词方 向描述为 i，然后是向上和向下方向哦，我们这里还有另一个方 向，让我先回答完这个问题，所以在物理学中，你经常会遇到这种情 况，你不是描述 xy 平面，而是将正确的向量描述为 i 有 时 i hat ，将垂直向量描述为 j hat ，所以这是 一个单独的事情，呃，物理学家将如何描述向量的正确方向，他们 不一定描述复数，完全独立的事情，实际上更有趣的是，约定产生 的原因，呃，我相信与扩展的数字系统有关即使在复数之外，它也 被称为四元数，因此对于复数，我们引入了称为 i 的东西，对 于四元数，我们引入了 j 和 k 这两个其他数字，这两个数 字碰巧也有负数的平方，发明它们的人 Hamilton 他试 图非常优雅地描述三维空间，并使用纯虚数方向 ij 和 k 成为实现这一目标的好方法，我认为正是因为这一点以及他试图推 动这一点，惯例才滑入呃正常物理学来描述i 和 j 当然现在 会导致严重的混乱，因为如果我们看看物理学家如何看待事物，你 知道 i 处于正确的方向 j 处于垂直方向，但对于复数 i 当然处于垂直方向，所以这只会造成整个潜在的混乱，嗯，现在我 们的是什么，哦，不，看起来他们拿走了评论，天哪，有一条评论 给了他们一些无礼的言论，然后他们感到尴尬，所以他们把它拿走 了，它在屏幕上，它就在那里供将来的每个人现在看到，我认为这 可能有足够的时间在这里学习一点代数，所以让我们继续对它进行 评分以供每个人查看，看起来你们中的绝大多数人都很好，我告诉 了你们答案所以我假设你们中的绝大多数人都给出了正确的答案哦 ，有趣的是，所以看起来呃五五是正确的，这是最常见的答案，但 是呃错过的是三和四，也许我们可以试着理解为什么三和四会是常 见的误解，69 接近 0 我加 5 是正确的，但我想只是呃 格式以一种奇怪的方式嗯所以让我们继续手工解决这个问题好吧事 实上，你知道复数相乘是一个令人愉快的过程，因为它是如此确定 ，你知道你必须做什么，你知道从哪里开始，你知道你将在哪里结束 ，这实际上只是通过它练习两次而已两个是我们得到的第一件事， 然后你取内部部分 i 乘以 2，这样就得到 2i，然后外部 部分是负 i 乘以 2，这样就是负 2i，然后最后一部分是 i 乘以负 i所以这将是负数 i 平方定义特征记住，i 平方与负一相同，这意味着我们答案的实际分量将是两倍二或四现 在减去负一，即加一，这样将会是 5，然后虚部相互抵消，2i 与负 2i 抵消，所以对于测验中回答呃 5 加零的每个人 ，我呃，你知道额外的分数，因为这实际上是 100 正确的你 是甚至强调我们是在一个复杂的背景下做这件事，所以没有理由你 应该在这个问题上被错误地评分，嗯，但是这里有趣的是，观看第 一堂课的人可能会注意到平方差的相似性这实际上是一个平方差类 型的问题，我猜你们中那些回答了三或四的人可能会归结为如果您 回答了三个，那将是因为您拿了这四个并减去了一个而不是减去负数 是一个非常常见的错误，这没有什么害处，然后如果你回答了四个 ，那是因为忘记了我的平方可以简化为实数这一事实，这样你就知 道现在对你最终答案的实数部分非常重要我认为有趣的是，仅仅遍 历代数的过程感觉与我们之前所说的乘以 z 具有旋转和拉伸物 体的作用的几何概念非常不同，并且它旋转和拉伸物体的方式是这 样的有必要让第一名坐在数字 z 上，事实上，我有一个好朋友 ，本·斯帕克斯 (Ben Sparks)，他是一个经常使用 数字文件的贡献者，你们中的一些人可能会认识，我请他呃制作一 些地理资料因为他只是一个地理高手，他实际上创建了基本上相当 于计算尺的复数，我们可以在这里使用它，所以它的工作方式是我 可以拿数字一并将其拖动到周围平面，正如我所做的那样，网格的 其余部分以它必须的方式移动，以便原点保持固定在适当的位置， 然后除了能够拉伸之外，其他所有东西都保持刚性，所以你可能会使 用这个方式就是说，我们想知道 z 乘以 w 是多少，我将拉 伸并旋转数字 1，使其落在 z 上，然后我将跟踪 w 发生 的情况，现在将其绘制为 a橙色向量遵循 w 发生的情况，当 它到达那里时，我们可以读出它现在结束于 5，即使在实践中， 你会用代数来计算它，就像我们刚刚在你的脑海中展示的那样这就 是它们的运作方式，有助于绘制复数和几何以及三角学之间的联系 ，我们稍后会谈到，事实证明这是比您想象的更有帮助的联系，所 以让我继续问你们这里的第二个问题是带回我们有用的小测验，鉴 于我刚刚告诉你关于复数如何运作的内容，我希望你帮我猜一下， 如果你不知道也没关系，如果你只是想在这里冒险猜测一下也没关 系。 复数 z 是多少，乘以 z 会产生逆时针旋转 30 度 或 pi 第六弧度的效果 好吧，所以你想对 z 进行编号， 这样当它被应用为一个动作时，你会说你对所有人做了什么其他可能 的复数，相应的操作是旋转 pi 6 弧度或 30 呃 30 度，好吧，太好了，我们已经得到了很多答案，围绕其中一个达 成了强烈共识，这总是一个好兆头，让我告诉你呃如何如果我在做 事的话，我可能会画出这个，所以我会看一下某种单位圆，幸运的 是，我有无限的单位圆供应，我会说，好吧，我知道我的动作想要 的就是将数字 1 带到此处的数字 1 的 30 度旋转，无 论这是什么复数 z 都将产生适当的作用，然后从那里开始，您 和我上次已经完成了，所以让我们看看我们的答案，在我们讨论解 释之前，让我们继续将它们锁定到位，在这种情况下，正确答案是 d，它是 pi 六的余弦加上 i pi 六的正弦恭喜对于 大多数正确回答的人来说，对我来说非常有趣的是，第二个最常见 的答案是 a，即 1 加 pi 6 嗯，我认为这实际上是一 个完全合理的猜测，让我们看看为什么会这样，如果我们回到我们友 好的单位圆，我们想要的数字是呃，就像我说的，坐在圆周率六弧 度周围，从我们上次讨论的所有内容来看，它的x分量是圆周率六 的余弦，这就是余弦被定义，然后它的 y 分量将是 pi 6 的正弦，这意味着我们正在处理的数字 z 将有 pi 6 的余弦的 x 分量，然后是虚数分量圆周率 6 的正弦 y 方向很好，现在第二个最常见的答案就像我说的那样，非常有趣， 嗯，如果我们把它拉起来，它是 a 加上圆周率 6 超过我让 我们看看它位于哪里我会在这里引入第二个更清洁的单位圈，就像 我说的，我有一个无限的供应，他们猜测这是一个，而不是绕着圆 周率六走，你直接走到圆周率六好吧，这实际上非常接近，特别是 对于小如果你只是笔直向上行走，这与绕圈行走没有太大区别，所 以如果你尝试使用这个数字来实现旋转 30 度的动作，那么它 会产生旋转 30 度的动作。 超过 30 度，他们会将事物拉伸 略大于一倍，但实际上很接近，嗯，这很酷，因为通常这些误解可 能在计算上非常错误，但这个想法是，呃，这里的误解在计算上是 相当错误的close 表示也许几何推理与事实相符，我认为这 很棒，所以给你一个说明如何实际使用它好吧，我们有一个具有 30 度旋转动作的数字，我想引入呃，当然是一个友好的 pi 生物，让我们所有人都想到白兰地，所以假设我有一个 pi 生物，但我不知道如何制作视频动画，并且在某些时候，无论出于 何种原因，我希望该 pi 生物旋转 30 度度数好吧，我只 是想让它们旋转，你可以用很多方法来做到这一点，计算机图形学 中最常见的方法之一是使用矩阵，这可能是另一天的整个主题，但 你可以使用的一种策略是使用复数和其工作方式是将我们的 pi 生物视为生活在复杂的平面中，然后在任何一种计算机图形中， 它总是用各种点定义，通常是它周围的这些控制点，并且我会给每个 控制点提供复杂的坐标例如，让我们说这里的右下脚，或者我猜舞 台左边我们的右边看起来有大约一负三的坐标，这样就会得到数字 一减三i，然后根据你们刚才在回答中告诉我的内容问题是，如果 我们想取该点，然后算出当我们绕原点旋转 30 度时，我应该 将其乘以 30 度的余弦乘以 30 度的正弦，如果您想确信 这一点复数和实数一样真实，我认为需要考虑的一个因素是，许多 编程语言都内置了复数，它们被认为和实数一样真实，所以我可以 做的是，我可以为我们拉一个小Python终端玩复数，如果我 写类似三个负一的东西被认为是有效类型，在这种情况下他们使用 j um 我认为基本上是因为在编程用语中 i 经常用作索 引变量，所以他们只是使用 j 而不是实际匹配在电气工程惯例 中，他们不使用 i 表示虚数，而是使用 j，因为 i 已经 被使用过，所以三减一 j 你可以将其读作与三减一 i 相同， 我可以采取这个数字，我可以将它乘以其他复数，我不知道像五四 二，如果我相乘，它将应用复数乘法的规则，这基本上只是将其消 除，你可以认为这是真正的部分是三乘四或12减去负一乘二，因 为记住我的平方给我们这个负数，所以这就是14的来源，然后虚 部将是负一乘四，即负四加三乘二，这确实是计算出两个，所以这 是一种很酷的Python，它似乎正在为我们解决所有这些问题 ，这意味着记住，假设我们想要旋转我们的 pi 生物，假设我 只关注一点，比如他的脚坐在这里，位于一负三，所以假设我将脚 定义为呃坐在实部一虚部负三呃我想要的旋转数z就是你们为我想 出的，我们要为此需要一些数学知识，所以让我们导入数学总是一 个信号，表明您即将获得一些乐趣，因此我们将调用 za 复数 ，其实部是余弦，我不能写 30 度，因为这将全部以弧度表示 ，所以我将其写为 pi 6，这与 30 度相同，然后 y 将 是数学点 pi 超过 6 的正弦值，所以如果我们看一下它的 组成部分，呃，实部约为 0。",
