00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Today we are going to talk about one of my absolute all-time favorite pieces of math.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,360
It's incredibly fundamental to engineering, to mathematics itself, to quantum mechanics,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,080
but it's something that has a terrible, terrible name. We call them complex numbers.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,120
And worse than that, the things that bring about complex numbers we call imaginary numbers.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,640
And before we get into any of it, what I want to do is start with kind of a poll,

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,040
just to poll the audience on seeing what you guys can consider to be, well, real. What do you

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,260
exist when it comes to numbers? So we've already been doing a couple polls in the warm-up

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,440
animations, but as a serious poll of sorts, one that's actually going to help me see where you're

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,040
coming from before we begin the lesson here, I just want to ask you a very simple question.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,740
Okay, so let's go ahead and pull it up here. Pull it on up. And,

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,020
oh, for whatever reason it seems like we're having trouble polling this one up. Okay, there we go.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,680
Took a little delay there. Among the values 2, square root of 2, square root of negative 1,

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,980
and infinity, which would you personally consider to really exist, whatever really existing means

14
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:19,160
to you? So in theory, if you guys go to 3b1b.co slash live, you should be able to answer this,

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,560
and then the statistics based on your answers are going to start populating the screen.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,740
We won't know what those answers refer to. At the moment, all we know is that, you know,

17
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,120
someone who has a lead, another one that's pretty close behind it, and as your answers come in and

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,960
as the servers kind of digest them, we'll start to see some of the stats here. If you go to that

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,160
page, by the way, 3b1b.co slash live, which redirects to itempool.com, what you're going

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,940
to find is at the very top, you can ask a question on Twitter, and all that's going to do is basically

21
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,960
open up a tweet that's going to have the hashtag in it, lockdown math, and that's the way that

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,720
we're going to be doing questions to this. Instead of a live chat, anytime you have a question or a

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,600
comment that you want to, you know, insert into the lesson and let that be part of the discussion,

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,600
it's going to be pulled up here, and it looks like we already have one. This is from Yash Dave, who

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,000
asks, if you could rename the complex numbers and the so-called imaginary numbers to something more

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,400
intuitive, to a name that conveyed the fact that they have numerous applications in the real world,

27
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,900
what would you name them? I couldn't be happier that you asked, Yash. So I have one friend who seems

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,420
very passionate about the fact that we should call them sneaky numbers. Personally, I'm very fond of

29
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,500
trying to connote spinning and rotation, and this is one of the things we'll talk about in today's

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,020
lesson, is the fact that what we call complex numbers, what we call imaginary numbers, some of

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,680
the main uses that they have come from very elegant descriptions of how to rotate stuff,

32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,800
and I hope you'll kind of see what I mean as we proceed with that. So on our poll, asking you guys

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,860
which numbers you consider to really exist, which is of course a subjective question, there's no

34
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,600
right or wrong answer here, I am genuinely curious, actually, how this breaks down, because it's not

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,780
at all a strong consensus in one direction. It seems like we've got three top contenders, and

36
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,440
then three that are falling pretty evenly behind that, so let's go ahead and take a look. What do

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:16,020
you consider to really exist when it comes to numbers? Now, I can imagine which ones might be

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,720
the top two, but I'm very curious about the fact that there's three all kind of coinciding with

39
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,060
each other there, and it looks like I'm getting a little bit of a delay before the reveal, so

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,940
there's kind of this nice dramatic pause. I'll tell you, for me personally, I feel like it's

41
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,340
very silly to answer anything that's either that's not all of them or none of them. I can maybe

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,480
understand if someone wants to treat infinity as something different because it's ill-defined,

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:50,700
there's lots of different things that that might mean, but insofar as numbers exist at all, if you

44
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:50,740
have a number of numbers, you can't really answer. So, for me, I think that the question is,

45
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,060
well, man, I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one. We had fixed it by live stream, too,

46
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,620
but I guess there's going to be an oscillation between when it works and when it doesn't.

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,300
But for me personally, basically, anytime that you have a numerical construct that's helpful in the

48
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,200
real world, you know, I consider that real. I would say that if it's something that's actually

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,640
useful in an application, then it is as real as words are, right? You're never going to run into

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,320
an abstract word like happiness out there, but it has a kind of reality in our minds. And things

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,520
like the square root of 2, which you can't express as a fraction, or things like the square root of

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,160
negative 1 that don't show up among real normal numbers, you know, even if they might seem a

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,100
little bit different, oh, this is such a shame. I'm genuinely curious to see what your answers are,

54
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,400
but it's not showing up for me, which I suppose means we'll have to move on with the lesson,

55
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,720
but this will presumably begin working by the end and we can maybe pull things up again.

56
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,980
So let me go ahead and take that away. What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you

57
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,060
the sense in which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, and from there

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,860
maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality. I won't assume that you know what they are yet,

59
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,500
it's meant to be a basic primer, but let's just dive right in. Okay, the end, by the way, the very

60
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,380
end here, I want to talk about two different trigonometric functions, and this is kind of the

61
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,460
thing that we're going to build to, two identities from trigonometry. And I understand that maybe,

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,960
oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry is not going to be the best way to lure some

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,280
people into understanding, oh yeah, complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really

64
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,220
going to love them. But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact that has nothing to do

65
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,180
with complex numbers or the square root of negative one, it's just trigonometry, it's everything we

66
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,980
were talking about last time. And you can have facts that are pretty hard to remember. I remember

67
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,520
when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, that if you want to know the cosine of

68
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,060
the sum of two different angles, you know, it's this kind of long thing in terms of cosines and

69
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,360
sines of the original two angles. There's this minus sign that would always trip people up.

70
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,620
If you do the same for the sine, it looks similar, but there's a plus sign, and instead of having

71
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,700
cos cos, you have cosine. It's something that's very error-prone if you're just trying to memorize

72
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,260
it as it is. However, if you come at it with complex numbers, this is not only much less

73
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,900
error-prone, it has a very beautiful meaning and it just falls right out. So even if you don't

74
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,400
necessarily believe in the reality of the square root of negative one, you at the very least have

75
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,980
to admit that it's interesting that it can make other pieces of math useful, that other pieces of

76
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:28,020
math a little bit more understandable too. And trigonometry is just the tip of the iceberg. If

77
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,220
you talk to anybody who's in engineering, anybody who's going into serious math, they'll tell you

78
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,120
that complex numbers are as real a part of their work and their life as real numbers are. But the

79
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,200
starting point looks very strange, okay? When you start introducing this, the very first thing you

80
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,100
do is to say, assume that there's some number i so that i squared is equal to negative one.

81
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,880
And I think to a lot of students there's maybe one of two possible reactions that you can have here.

82
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,800
One is, no there isn't, right? Any time I square a number, even if it's negative, if I take negative

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,980
five for example and I square it, well a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25. Any

84
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,120
number that you square, if it's positive, well that just stays positive. So it seems like no matter

85
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,460
what, when I'm squaring numbers I always get a positive number. I'm never going to get anything

86
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:24,760
negative. So this does not exist, no such number. However, if a mathematician comes and says, oh no

87
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,560
it exists, we've defined it so that that's the case. I think the other reaction someone can have

88
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,760
is, hang on a second, you can do that? When you have a problem that you can't solve you can just

89
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,060
say, oh I've defined things so that we now magically have a solution. Okay, next time I'm having

90
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,840
trouble with my homework and I don't know what the answer to x is, I will be like, let x be the value

91
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,900
defined to be the answer to this question. So if you're uncomfortable with this, you're definitely

92
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,920
not alone. In fact, Rene Descartes coined the term imaginary for these numbers as a derogatory. It

93
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,900
was meant to make fun of the fact that obviously there is no such answer and it shouldn't be taken

94
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,880
as serious math. And then we stuck with that as a convention and we still call them imaginary

95
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,240
numbers, which is genuinely absurd. But that's not the only weird assumption that we make. The second

96
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,060
weird thing that you do when you start talking about complex numbers is to say, there's not just

97
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,660
a number i, but we're going to give it a home. Instead of the real number line, which you know,

98
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,740
all of these numbers we know when we square them, you can't get a negative, what we do is say i lives

99
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,260
in a different dimension. i lives perpendicularly. There's one above and then there's one below,

100
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,640
negative i, and you can have negative 2i. You scale it however you want. Essentially it's proposing

101
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,280
that numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very specific home, one unit perpendicular

102
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,240
perpendicularly above the real number line. And okay, if we want to extend our number system,

103
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,300
I get it, maybe it's useful to put some kind of number up there, but why i, right? Why not say

104
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,500
infinity is the number that sits one unit above zero, or one divided by zero, or any other problem

105
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,640
that you couldn't solve before and you make up an answer to, why should that live there? What on

106
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,080
earth does the idea of a point one unit above the real number line in a separate dimension

107
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,360
have to do with squaring to negative one? So I hope to answer this for you. At the very beginning,

108
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,540
let's just talk about how if you're adding numbers that are two-dimensional like this, the rules are

109
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,760
pretty straightforward and it operates essentially the same as vectors for any of you who might be

110
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,480
familiar with vectors. So let's say hypothetically I have a number, oh I don't know, let me

111
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,060
draw one here that's going to be four plus i, okay? And then I'm going to take a second number

112
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,380
and it's helpful to draw them as vectors, kind of an arrow from the number zero,

113
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,540
and this one is going to end up at negative two plus two i. So what I'm saying is you take the

114
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,960
real number negative two and then you move in that perpendicular direction into the extension

115
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,220
of our number system, which again you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here

116
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,340
that you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers extend in this

117
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,360
direction. If you take that on faith and you follow, hopefully the fact that it becomes useful

118
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,360
helps to justify why we're doing any of this. So my question for you is simply what happens when

119
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,520
we add these two numbers? Now assuming that our question system has not broken down, I should be

120
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,140
able to do this as a proper poll and let me go ahead, I guess we can first check the previous

121
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,440
poll, okay things seem to be working so we can take a little step back in the lesson so I'm just

122
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,140
genuinely curious, I want to know how you guys answered on this one. It looks like there's a

123
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:40,160
there's a back and forth between answers f and d, so f is all of them saying that all of these should

124
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,940
be considered real, and interesting d is the one that says you should consider two square root of

125
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,580
two and negative one but not infinity, so there's a good contingent of you out there who would just

126
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,380
reject infinity as being considered real but are very comfortable with the square root of negative

127
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,180
one, that's awesome, and then after that it looks like c, people who reject the square root of

128
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,800
negative one, fascinating, I actually would have thought that none of them would have come higher

129
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,580
than that, none of them is much lower at a, okay so it looks like we've got a cohort of people who

130
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,080
are comfortable with negative one, a large cohort are uncomfortable with infinity, that's a topic

131
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,780
for another day, don't worry about it, and then a number of people who are kind of in that middle

132
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,300
ground of maybe not being super comfortable with the idea that negative one might be real,

133
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,280
let's see if we can convince you of the difference of that. So for our first much more mathematical

134
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,380
question, as kind of a warm-up, I just want to ask you to add these two. Before I've taught you how

135
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:37,820
to add them, make a guess at how it might work, and I hope that it feels pretty straightforward,

136
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,120
addition is actually the least interesting part of this, but it is, it's a good thing to know when

137
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,760
you're learning about complex numbers, it's definitely one of those operations that you are

138
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,480
going to need to know. Unfortunately, and you can tell by the fact that I'm stalling and what I'm

139
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,180
saying here, it looks like the question is still not loading completely correctly, so I'm going to

140
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,940
have a stern word with Cam and Ider behind the scenes who have otherwise built such a beautiful,

141
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,280
beautiful interface that's helpful for this kind of back and forth between you guys and me.

142
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna have a stern word with them behind the scenes, but in the meantime,

143
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,520
let's go ahead and move forward with the lesson here. So I guess I can pull it up on the, just on

144
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,800
the piece of paper, and you can follow along at home, see what the addition might be. It turns out

145
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,040
to be relatively straightforward. If you're moving four units to the right and then one unit up,

146
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,180
and you want to add the idea of moving two units to the left and then two units up, well you just

147
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,660
do each of those one at a time. I'll go ahead and pull out black here. The real part is going to be

148
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,600
those four to the right, then minus two to the left, okay, straightforward enough, and then the

149
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,540
imaginary part is going to be this one unit up and then these two units up, one plus two, times i,

150
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:54,220
so is that one i plus two i, and then when you work that out four minus two is two, one plus two is

151
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,360
three. A nice simple introduction here. Addition doesn't really have anything complicated going on,

152
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,300
which is great. That means that it's one fewer thing for us to worry about. What is so complex

153
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,480
about complex numbers after all? Well where everything becomes interesting is when you try

154
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,160
to multiply these numbers together. So with vectors, there's not really any notion of

155
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,540
multiplying them to get two vectors back, at least when we're in the 2d plane. You have some notions

156
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,680
like cross products and dot products that in three dimensions can get you something like it,

157
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,500
but the rules end up being very different from that in the number system. You can't really do

158
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,880
algebra. You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, then one of them

159
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,180
has to be zero, but complex numbers are going to end up behaving much like the real numbers, so

160
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,920
rules from algebra can carry over, but to understand what that rotation rule is, oh no I'm giving things

161
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,180
away, what that multiplication rule is, I just want to ask you a simple question, which is basically

162
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,460
suppose I have the point three two, okay, we're not even going to think of it as a complex number per

163
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,120
se, if I just have some sort of coordinate grid and I go to the point with x coordinate three and y

164
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,440
coordinate two, what is the 90 degree rotation of this? If I rotate it 90 degrees and let's say

165
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:19,440
counterclockwise, counter, counter, jeez, writing is difficult, counterclockwise.

166
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,320
Okay, now what's lovely about this is we can basically just turn our paper to figure it out.

167
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,020
We say okay if it started at three two and then I rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, I can just read

168
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:41,880
that off now as being negative two in the x direction and then three in the y direction, if I

169
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,180
had rotated the whole plane like that. So what we've done here is we've taken three two and then we

170
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:54,060
convert it to negative two three, something which maybe in our original system,

171
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,900
you know, looks like this, negative two and then three, that's going to be the 90 degree rotation.

172
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,940
And what's nice here is that that rule is very simple and it applies to any pair that we might

173
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,400
have. If I took a pair of numbers a comma b, okay, and then I said where is that going to rotate to

174
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,220
if I rotate it 90 degrees, it's going to end up by swapping the coordinates b a and then making

175
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,600
that first one negative. That's a 90 degree rotation. And a nice gut check here is to say

176
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,520
what happens when we do that twice? What if we do that same very mechanistic operation again twice?

177
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,960
And I'm going to go and take this, I swap the two coordinates, we get a negative b, but then that

178
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,840
first one becomes negative. So that was another 90 degree rotation. Well what's happened here is

179
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,780
we've just made both of the coordinates negative and that's reassuring because if I take some point

180
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:52,820
sitting at a b and then I rotate it 90 degrees, so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation,

181
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,380
and then another 90 degrees that's the same as a 180 degree roto- oh no I've done that wrong.

182
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,840
That will be the same as a 180 degree rotation which should look like this, ignore the other

183
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,760
vector that I drew, which is just taking both of the coordinates and making them negative.

184
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,740
Negative a negative b, okay. So that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree rotation

185
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,760
actually behaves like you would expect it to. Now why am I asking you this?

186
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,620
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again, so I'm going to have

187
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,700
you do your very first complex product. Oh look a lot of people did submit answers, very good.

188
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,840
Great let's grade the complex addition actually, let's see if it is as straightforward a process

189
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,320
as I was hoping it was and see how much explanation is demanded. Okay so it looks like a majority of

190
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,080
you did get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i, very good, very good. 52 of you answered simply 2

191
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,020
which would have been the real part of the answer so maybe just the fact that there's some vertical

192
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,360
component and you need to still add those vertical components or maybe those of you who answered 2

193
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,040
reject the reality of imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical

194
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:12,340
component. Some of you answered negative 2 3 which I guess is just making- that's just swapping up

195
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,400
whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus 4 so that's completely understandable. We've got 2

196
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,980
plus 3 which is maybe just dropping off the i so I think maybe a lot of like simple errors and

197
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,000
entry and you know that happens to all of us especially on tests is sometimes you know what

198
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,360
the right answer is but then you you forget a symbol or you swap two so that's all very good.

199
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,740
Let's go ahead and try our very first product though like I said. So here because I already

200
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,460
talked through one of the questions we're going to go ahead and skip ahead of it. We know how to

201
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,500
rotate something like 3 comma 2 so I'm not even going to give you time to do that and properly

202
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:55,800
grade it. Stal, stal, words, words. You know they tell me that it's working and yet it's very slow

203
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,360
for me to progress forward so you know if I'm not going to have a stern word with them you guys can

204
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,000
go at them on twitter too under the same place that we ask questions and just say hey

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,280
Kamineter can't you make the live questions work a little bit better for us? Okay I think we're

206
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:19,820
finally there. Everybody ready? Aha wonderful. Very simple question. I want you to take the number i

207
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,220
and I want you to multiply it by 3 plus 2i and even though I haven't really talked about the

208
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,860
rules for multiplication what I can say is pretend like it operates just like it does for normal

209
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,780
numbers. You've got things like the distributive property where you can distribute this throughout

210
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,520
and then the defining feature of i is this idea that i squared is negative 1. That's the only

211
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,660
special thing you need to know about that. Other than that just treat it like it's a normal number

212
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,060
okay and then proceed forward with the product. Wonderful okay so it looks like we've got quite

213
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,900
a few of you coming in to answer which is always lovely. Super exciting for me by the way just how

214
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,940
many people are enthusiastic about coming and like getting back to the fundamentals of math

215
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,860
in this lockdown and just you know we're gonna sit back for an hour and we're gonna learn about

216
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,560
complex numbers and we're actually gonna participate we're actually gonna answer questions as you do

217
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:13,100
rather than sitting and passively watching. This is genuinely delightful to me. Okay this is this

218
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,020
isn't necessarily a question I was expecting to divide the audience necessarily so unsurprisingly

219
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,580
it looks like we have a very strong majority in one direction hopefully in the correct direction

220
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,920
but if not that would that would heavily inform where the lesson should go so that would be quite

221
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:35,700
useful and I think that's probably enough time so I'm going to go ahead and lock the answers into

222
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,280
this one okay and it looks like the majority of you answered negative two plus three i which is

223
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,060
absolutely correct absolutely correct so there's two ways to think about this okay one of them is

224
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:54,640
to walk forward with the algebra and just do it a little bit mechanistically okay so if we pull

225
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:04,840
ourselves up our sheet if we take i times three plus two i three plus two i it just distributes

226
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,940
i times three is going to be three i i times two i is going to be two times i squared by definition

227
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,640
i squared is negative one which means that our final answer is going to look like negative two

228
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,960
plus three i okay and like I said it looks like a majority of you correctly did that product

229
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,480
now it's one thing to just walk through it mechanistically it's another to step back and say

230
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,960
what just happened geometrically right because what we just talked through was the fact that

231
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,540
if you want to rotate numbers 90 degrees the rule is to swap the two coordinates and then multiply

232
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,740
that first one by negative two well look at what's happened here we've got three and two those

233
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,080
coordinates have been swapped two is now the real part three is the imaginary part but that two got

234
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,520
multiplied by a negative one because i has this defining feature of squaring to become negative

235
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,200
one so that should give you some indication that okay multiplying by i has this action of rotating

236
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,860
things by 90 degrees maybe that means that it's not a crazy thing to do to geometrically position

237
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:15,740
i at a 90 degree angle with the real number line okay now to really see why that ends up being

238
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,080
useful it turns out that if you have that if you have a number that behaves this way it gives you

239
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,880
a computational mechanism for all of the other types of rotations that you might want to do

240
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,880
that might not necessarily be 90 degrees and to show you why this works I'm going to go ahead and

241
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,460
pull up an animation so let's say we have any number z and in this case z is going to be let's

242
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:44,060
see where do I have it z is going to be at two plus i great and let's say I want to understand

243
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:50,640
what is multiplying by z due to every other possible complex number well we can go one by one

244
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,960
the very first one that's relatively simple is if I ask what is z times one where does it take the

245
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,360
number one well z times one is going to be z so we're going to take the number one which I might

246
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,320
draw with a little yellow arrow and we're going to rotate and stretch that arrow up to the point

247
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,820
where z is great a kind of trivial fact even though it's trivial I'm actually going to take

248
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,700
a moment to write that down just so that we can oh no no no that's for that's for later that is

249
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,120
Randy don't you guys worry about him he'll be coming in in just a moment so I just want to

250
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:29,580
write down three crucial facts that are getting an influence rotation three facts I'll call it

251
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,940
facts about multiplication

252
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,400
the first two are going to look simple the third one is going to look innocuous but it ends up

253
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,200
being extremely constraining so the first one is that if I have any number z and I multiply it by

254
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,800
one will I get the number z back okay geometrically that means with that we stretch and rotate that

255
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,940
vector one to get what we want the second one is that if I take z times i from what we just talked

256
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,000
about that is the 90 degree rotation what I might write is like rotate by 90 degrees the number z

257
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,860
okay so often our animation what does that look like let's see we've already multiplied by one

258
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:15,500
we take i and then it's going to move to whatever the 90 degree rotation point for z itself is okay

259
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,920
so two down infinitely many to go okay we know what it does to one we know what it does to i

260
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,780
let's see if we can understand what z does to any other possible number well it turns out those two

261
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,220
is really all we need to work with if we have the distributive property so the third fact that's

262
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:41,140
going to look kind of innocuous is let's say I take this z and I multiply it by c plus d times i

263
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,240
where c and d are just any two numbers okay well this is going to distribute so z times c

264
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,380
I'm actually going to write that a little differently I'm going to write it as c times z

265
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,300
plus z times d i which again I'm going to write in kind of a funny order and write that as d

266
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:08,160
times z i now the idea here is well we know where z is we also know where z times i is so if we're

267
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,320
just scaling them up by some other constants that completely constrains where we need to go

268
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,400
so let me go ahead and write this down with an example okay let's say that we go back here and

269
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,840
want to know what multiplying by z does to anything I want to tell I want to convince you

270
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,620
that it rotates all of the grid in a way that keeps these lines parallel it keeps them evenly

271
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,580
spaced keeps them perpendicular to each other it applies this very constrained rule to the whole

272
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,580
plane and really just think through any one particular point for this let's say that we have

273
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:44,720
two times negative i okay so you move two units in the positive right direction and then negative

274
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,800
one unit in the vertical direction well after the product where that's going to land has to be

275
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,140
two times wherever z lands plus negative one times wherever i lands okay and we see that right it's

276
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,340
two times this yellow vector and it'll be negative one times the green vector so here even before you

277
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,520
actually work out the product we could just read off the fact that z here which looks like it's

278
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:16,620
plus i multiplied by two minus i must land on the number five okay so i actually want you guys to

279
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,180
work this out algebraically because i do think that it's um it's edifying to see this work in

280
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,060
practice right the fact that we have this geometric rule where we're just kind of stretching and

281
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,600
rotating and this corresponds to an otherwise very mechanistic process of expanding out a sum

282
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,940
so let's pull back our quiz and i'm going to

283
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,420
it's a little bit silly because i've revealed the answer but what i actually want you guys to do

284
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,040
here is take a look at the question which says what is two plus i times two minus i

285
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,980
and if you have notes right now if you have a pencil and paper which i encourage you to always

286
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,900
come to class with i want you to try working it out do the first inside outside last distribution

287
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,440
property just to see mechanistically what number ends up popping out from this and then we'll try

288
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,180
to see how that squares with the geometric intuition so while you're doing that while

289
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,360
you're working that out hopefully on pencil and paper it looks like we've got a question from the

290
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,760
audience which is is i the same as i and j the vectors in physics great question actually that's

291
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,290
that's a much more interesting question than you might think it is the short answer is no so in

292
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,590
physics you often describe the right word direction as i and then the up and down direction

293
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:36,090
as oh we've got another one here let me finish answering the question first so in physics you

294
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:42,970
you often have this situation where instead of describing the xy plane you describe the right

295
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:50,590
vector as i sometimes i hat and the vertical one as j hat so that's a separate thing that's how

296
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,210
physicists will describe the right direction up direction for vectors they're not necessarily

297
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,830
describing complex numbers totally separate thing what's more interesting actually is that the

298
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,490
reason that convention came about uh i believe has to do with a number system that extends even

299
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,810
beyond complex numbers it's called the quaternions so with the complex numbers we introduce something

300
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:15,310
called i with the quaternions we introduce j and k these two other numbers both of which also have

301
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:20,450
squares to negative one as it happens um and the guy who invented them hamilton he was trying to

302
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,010
describe three-dimensional space very elegantly and using the purely imaginary directions i j and

303
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,890
k became a nice way to do that and i think it's because of that and his attempts to push that

304
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:36,870
forward that the conventions slipped into uh normal physics to just describe those as i and j

305
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,890
of course that leads to serious confusion now because if we look at how physicists think of

306
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,710
things you know i is in the right direction j is in the vertical direction but with complex numbers

307
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,010
i is of course in the vertical direction so it just makes for a whole potential mess

308
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,030
um now what was our oh no it looks like they took away the comment oh man there was a comment

309
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,210
giving them some sass and then they got embarrassed so they pulled it away well it's on screen it's in

310
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,730
there for everyone in the future to see now i think that's probably been enough time to uh work

311
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,330
through a little bit of algebra here so let's go ahead and grade it for everyone to see and it

312
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,970
looks like the vast majority of you well i told you the answer so i'm going to assume the vast

313
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:22,610
majority of you are giving the correct answer oh interesting okay so it looks like uh five

314
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,130
five is correct and that's the most common answer but then the ones uh were missed were three and

315
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,230
four and maybe we can try to understand why three and four would have been common um misconceptions

316
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:40,830
on this one 69 is close zero i plus five is correct but i guess just uh formatted in a weird way

317
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:48,050
um so let's let's go ahead and work this one out by hand okay it's actually you know kind of a

318
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,790
pleasant process to multiply complex numbers because it's so deterministic you know what

319
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,570
you have to do you know where you start you know where you're going to end and it's really just

320
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:02,450
kind of practicing through it um so two times two that's the first thing that we get and then you

321
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:08,770
take the inside parts i times two so that's going to be two i and then the outside parts which is

322
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:15,470
negative i times two so that's negative two i and then the last part which is i times negative i

323
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,490
so that'll be negative i squared the defining feature remember is that i squared is the same

324
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,430
as negative one which means that the real component of our answer is going to be two

325
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:33,650
times two or four now minus negative one which is plus one so that'll be five and then the imaginary

326
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,770
parts cancel each other out that two i cancels out with a negative two i so to everyone on the

327
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,370
quiz who answered five plus zero i uh you know extra credit to you because that actually is

328
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,530
100 correct you're even emphasizing that we're doing this in a complex context so there's no

329
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:54,410
reason that you should have been graded incorrectly on that one um however what's uh what's interesting

330
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,930
here those of you who watched the very first lecture might notice the similarity with difference

331
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,110
of squares and this is effectively a difference of squares type question and i'm going to guess

332
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,610
those of you who answered three or four it probably came down to if you answered three

333
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,490
it would have been because you took this four and you subtracted one rather than subtracting

334
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:16,190
negative one very common mistake no harm in that and then if you answered four it comes from

335
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,830
forgetting the fact that i squared can be simplified into a real number so that you know

336
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:27,090
that very much counts for the the real component of your final answer now what's interesting i

337
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:32,090
think is that that process of just walking through the algebra feels very different from this

338
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:38,590
idea that we had before of saying multiplying by z has the action of rotating and stretching things

339
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,190
and how it rotates and stretches things is in the way that's necessary to get the number one

340
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:49,870
to sit on the number z and in fact i have a i have a good friend uh ben sparks who is a frequent

341
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:55,930
number file uh contributor some of you might recognize and i asked him uh to whip up a little

342
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:01,230
geogibra thing because he's just a geogibro whiz and he actually created basically the complex

343
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,650
number equivalent of a slide rule that we can play with here so the way that this is going to

344
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:11,210
work is that i can take the number one and sort of drag it around the plane and as i do the rest

345
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,990
of the grid moves in the way that it has to so that the origin stays fixed in place and then

346
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,390
everything else kind of stays rigid with the exception of being able to stretch so the way

347
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,430
that you might use this is to say let's say we want to know what z times w is well i'm going to

348
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,890
stretch and rotate the number one so that it lands on z and then i'm going to follow what

349
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,070
happens to w which is now drawn as a a orange vector follow what happens to w and as it lands

350
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,890
there we can just read off that it ends up at five now even though in practice computationally

351
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,450
you would be working it out with the algebra like we just showed having in the back of your mind

352
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,310
that this is how they operate helps draw the connection between complex numbers and geometry

353
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,950
and also trigonometry which we'll get to in a moment and that turns out to be a much more

354
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,190
helpful connection than you might expect so let me go ahead and ask you guys a second question

355
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,710
here which is to bring back our helpful little friendly quiz

356
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,610
given what i just told you about how complex numbers act i want you to guess for me it's

357
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,930
okay if you don't know it's okay if you just want to hazard a guess here what is the complex number

358
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:27,830
z so that multiplying by z has the effect of rotating 30 degrees or pi sixth radians

359
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,610
counterclockwise okay so you want to number z so that when it's being applied as an action and

360
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,550
you're saying what do you do to all the other possible complex numbers the corresponding action

361
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:46,090
is to rotate by pi six radians or 30 uh 30 degrees okay great we've got a lot of answers coming in

362
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:52,850
strong consensus around one of them which is always a good sign let me show you uh how i

363
00:32:52,850 --> 00:33:00,130
might draw this out um if i were doing things so i would take a look at um a unit circle of some

364
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:06,190
kind and luckily i have my infinite supply of unit circles sitting right here and i would say okay i

365
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,550
know that the action that i want is going to be whatever takes the number one to something that's

366
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:17,210
30 degree rotation of the number one that sits up here whatever complex number z this is is going to

367
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,670
have the appropriate action and then from there it's all of the trigonometry that you and i were

368
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,730
working through last time so let's look at our answers and let's go ahead and lock them into

369
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:34,450
place now before we talk through the explanation and the correct answer in this context is d which

370
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:40,670
is cosine of pi six plus i sine of pi six congratulations to the uh majority of you who

371
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,690
correctly answered that very interesting to me actually is that the second most common answer

372
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:52,470
was a which is one plus pi six um and i think that's that's an utterly reasonable guess actually

373
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:59,270
and let's take a look at why so if we go back to our our friendly unit circle the number we were

374
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:06,830
going for is uh like i said sitting pi six radians around and from everything we talked

375
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:14,590
about last time the x component of that is the cosine of pi six this is sort of how cosine is

376
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:23,530
defined and then the y component of that is going to be sine of pi six which means that that number

377
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:29,810
z that we're dealing with okay is going to have an x component of cosine of pi six

378
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,330
and then an imaginary component what's in the y direction of sine of pi six

379
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,430
great now that second most common answer like i said that's very interesting um if we pull it up

380
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:51,090
it was a which was one plus pi six over i let's take a look at where that sits with a i'll bring

381
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,630
in a second cleaner unit circle here like i said i've got an infinite supply they were guessing

382
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:02,130
that it's one and that instead of walking pi six around that you walk just straight up pi six okay

383
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:08,910
which is actually quite close right especially for small angles if you're just walking straight

384
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,030
up that's not too different from walking around the circle so if you were to try to use that

385
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:18,750
number um to have the action of rotating by 30 degrees it would have an action of rotating by

386
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,570
something that's slightly less than 30 degrees and it would stretch things out by something

387
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,370
that's slightly more than a factor of one but it's actually close um which is cool because usually

388
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,290
the misconceptions might be like very wrong computationally but the idea that the uh the

389
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,850
misconception here was like computationally quite close indicates that maybe the geometric reasoning

390
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:42,090
was lining up with truth which i think is awesome so to give you an illustration of how this might

391
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:47,510
actually be used okay we have a number that has this action of a 30 degree rotation i want to

392
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,430
bring in uh of course a friendly pie creature for us to all think about

393
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:58,110
brandy so let's say that i have a pie creature and i'm i don't know animating a video and at some

394
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:03,830
point for whatever reason i want that pie creature to rotate 30 degrees okay i just want them to

395
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,030
rotate there's lots of ways you could do this um one of the most common ones in computer graphics

396
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:13,930
is to use matrices which might be a whole topic for another day but a tactic you could use is to

397
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:19,110
use complex numbers and the way this would work is to think of our pie creature as living in the

398
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,990
complex plane and then at any kind of computer graphics it's always defined with various points

399
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,610
often these control points around it and each one of those control points i would give complex

400
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:35,990
coordinates to so for example let's say the the lower right foot here or i guess uh stage left

401
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,330
our right looks like it has coordinates about one negative three so that would be given the number

402
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,530
one minus three i and then from what you guys just told me in answering the question if we want

403
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,050
to take that point and then figure out where it gets when we rotate 30 degrees about the origin

404
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:57,410
what i should be multiplying it by is cosine of 30 degrees by sine of 30 degrees and if ever you

405
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,370
wanted to be convinced that complex numbers are just as real as real numbers i think one factor

406
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:10,790
to consider is that many programming languages have built into them complex numbers they are

407
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,310
a little python terminal for us to play with and complex numbers if i write something like three

408
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:23,510
negative one are considered a valid type in this case they use j i think basically because

409
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,830
in programming parlance i is often used as an indexing variable so they just go with j instead

410
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:34,130
that actually matches with electrical engineering convention too where they instead of using i for

411
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,870
the imaginary number they use j because again i was kind of already used so three minus one j you

412
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:44,250
just read that as being the same as three minus one i and i can take this number and i can

413
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:51,110
multiply it by other complex values i don't know like five four two if i multiply that it's going

414
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:57,550
to apply the rules of complex multiplication which basically is just foiling it out you can think of

415
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:04,590
this as being the real part is three times four or twelve minus negative one times two because

416
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,910
remember that i squared gives us that negative so that's where the 14 comes from and then the

417
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:15,730
imaginary part is going to be that negative one times four which is negative four plus three times

418
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:21,170
two which indeed works out to two so that's kind of cool python seems to be working all of this

419
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:26,170
out for us and what that means remember is let's say that we wanted to rotate our pi creature and

420
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,890
let's say i'm just going to focus on one point like his foot sitting here which is at one negative

421
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:37,410
three so let's say i define the foot to be uh sitting at real part one imaginary part negative

422
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,310
three uh the rotating number that i want z is what you guys figured out for me we're going to

423
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,910
need a little math for this so let's import math always a sign that you're about to have some fun

424
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:53,250
so we're going to call z a complex number whose real part is the cosine well i can't write 30

425
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,630
degrees because this will all be in radians so i'll write it as pi six that's the same thing as

426
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:07,010
30 degrees and then the y is going to be the sine of that sine of math dot pi over six great so if

427
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:13,630
we look at its components the real part is around 0.866 and the imaginary part should be exactly one

428
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,990
half but you know often you get a little numerical error because computers they can't get all the

429
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,530
real numbers perfectly there's just not enough information in the universe so they have to have

430
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:27,470
a little bit of an error there some of you might recognize that that first part is the square root

431
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:32,690
of three divided by two this is everything we were working out last lecture for computing things like

432
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:38,910
cosine of pi six now what this means for us is if we take z times foot right or remember foot was

433
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,950
that one negative three z times foot should tell us where it goes when you just go through the

434
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,410
mechanistic operation of complex multiplication this point should tell us where it lands

435
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:55,750
evidently it's supposed to land at around 2.3 as a real part and then negative 2.09 as the imaginary

436
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,930
part and indeed when we play that out and we follow our little foot point here where does it

437
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:06,030
land all right it looks like the real part is a little above two and the imaginary part is a

438
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,590
little less than negative two and any deviation there is probably because the foot wasn't exactly

439
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:15,190
at that point one negative three like i said but you can see what i mean in principle you tell the

440
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:19,890
computer to do this for every single point in a given image that you want and it will tell you

441
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,590
where the outputs should be it'll tell you where the rotated versions should be so complex numbers

442
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:30,330
are certainly as real as real numbers in that respect it looks like we've got a question from

443
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:35,710
the audience so let's go ahead and pull that up seal programmer asks what is the biggest reason

444
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:41,330
that people use vectors and matrices to represent rotation instead of complex numbers that is

445
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,670
actually a very interesting question i don't know if there's a great reason actually because if all

446
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:51,190
you're going to do is rotate and then potentially scale things you could have everything defined in

447
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,110
terms of complex numbers in 2d graphics in 3d graphics that actually wouldn't work complex

448
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:02,370
numbers only describe rotations in two dimensions however if you want to use a number system to

449
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:06,950
describe rotations in three dimensions instead of using matrices you could use these things called

450
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:12,510
quaternions which are basically the complex numbers on steroids and in fact they they expose

451
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:17,070
you to fewer errors like there's errors that come about when you try to use matrices for 3d rotation

452
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:21,770
this thing called gimbal lock talk to any roboticist or any computer graphics programmers

453
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,350
they'll tell you that gimbal lock is a real pain and the quaternions this sort of complex numbers

454
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:31,250
on steroids helps to solve that problem there's a whole other contingent of people who feel

455
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,710
passionate about something called geometric algebra that is a whole other topic potentially

456
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,290
for another day but that's that's a really valid question you've got these two perspectives on one

457
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:47,230
one possible operation but if we're just coming at it from the idea that complex numbers play a role

458
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,170
in other parts of math and in other parts of engineering i think thinking of the rotation

459
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:58,650
implications really helps us see that and this is particularly visceral for me when i think in

460
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,030
terms of trig identities so if you remember at the very beginning i opened up by talking about

461
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,190
one particular trig identity and without pulling it up again i don't want to go back and just read

462
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,190
off of it i'm going to ask you one more question which this is going to be a tricky question this

463
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:18,610
one will actually take some time to work through which is i want you to calculate for me the cosine

464
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:26,530
of 75 degrees okay and let's go ahead and pull this up as a quiz question so let's pull up our

465
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:32,990
quiz let's move on to the next question let's cross our fingers and hope that cam and eater

466
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:39,250
have not broken anything again and that's all it's asking what is the cosine of 75 degrees

467
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:46,710
okay now let me get you started here on how you might think about it 75 degrees it's not going to

468
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,950
be based on any triangles that we might have seen maybe you've seen a 75 degree triangle and you

469
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,710
happen to remember what its side lengths were but most people won't have however what you can do

470
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:04,690
is note that 75 is the same as taking 45 degrees and then walking another 30 degrees around

471
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:12,810
okay 45 plus 30 degrees and if our question is asking us for the cosine of 75 one way to think

472
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:19,210
of it is if you first walk 45 degrees around and then you walk another 30 degrees around what is

473
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,970
the x coordinate of that corresponding point okay so this is going to have some coordinates x y

474
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,930
the cosine of 75 degrees is asking for the x coordinate of that now like i said i think this is

475
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:35,890
this is not easy okay so it's going to take some time to work out and while you guys are working

476
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,030
this out i want you to actually pull out some pencil and paper and think it through i'm just

477
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,070
gonna pull up a little pause and ponder music and give us i don't know i might give us a full

478
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:50,470
60 seconds or so to like noodle this one out and think it through um and in the meantime if you

479
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:55,070
want to ask any questions uh you know how to do so through twitter it's with the hashtag lockdown

480
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:59,550
math and i might go ahead and take a couple questions while people try working this out by

481
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,970
hand which again i heavily encourage you to do even if you're not watching this live even if

482
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,330
you're watching this at a later date this is the time to say okay i'm gonna pull out my paper i'm

483
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,670
gonna try to think this through and and now i'll stop talking i'll let you just think

484
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,390
certainly don't feel rushed by the way even if there are some answers rolling in right now

485
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:40,530
that is by no means any indication that you should have finished or anything like that

486
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:11,670
so interestingly we do have a strong lead but it's not at all a strong second place so it seems

487
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,470
like the the way that the assuming that the lead is correct the way that the errors have happened

488
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,510
is not in a consistent way which is interesting and that'll be

489
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,630
that'll be fun to dissect once we reveal what the answers are

490
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:46,650
let's um let me check if there's any new questions that have rolled in no huh which suggests to me

491
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,290
that the two folks that i have behind the scenes who are supposed to feed me questions

492
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:55,770
are probably desperately wrangling with uh something item pool related

493
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,370
those of you who have already submitted an answer or who think you already submitted an answer

494
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:11,510
answer by the way i want you to take a moment to uh seriously guess what you think the second most

495
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,610
common answer is going to be um and where exactly the misconception could have taken place or to

496
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:22,610
double check your work you very well might be one of those sitting in the um the misconception

497
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:28,190
territory which you know it's uh it's a lot to work out there's a lot of different failure

498
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,810
points along the way

499
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:47,310
all right so with that i'm going to go ahead and lock in the answers and if you want to just still

500
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:50,690
work it through even if the answer isn't going to be recorded that's totally fine we're going to

501
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:55,310
walk through it in a moment but i'm going to lock them in just so that we can see um what the correct

502
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:59,830
answer turns out to be and the correct answer is d which it looks like a majority of you got so

503
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:05,390
that's awesome um the second most common was c which really only differs by a minus sign and i

504
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,570
can i can actually guess why that's true already so that's that's interesting um after that is b

505
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,770
where there's a square root of three instead of a square root of two okay so we have we actually

506
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:19,510
have a pretty good distribution on this i think that this shows that this is not at all an obvious

507
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:24,530
question and can take um take a little bit of noodling to figure out so if i saw this on a test

508
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:31,050
let's say that someone threw like a high school math test at me right now and it said cosine of

509
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:38,310
75 you know i would know that in principle i'm supposed to be thinking of this as uh in terms of

510
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,610
friendlier angles i know that 45 degrees is a friendly angle for trigonometry and i know that

511
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:48,330
30 degrees is what i don't have memorized though are the addition formulas uh i learned them once

512
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:52,950
slipped out of my head definitely don't have them memorized but i do know how to re-derive them on

513
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:58,590
fly basically the idea is that we take the complex number associated with the 45 degree rotation

514
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:09,650
which is going to be cosine of 45 degrees plus i times the sine of 45 degrees i take that complex

515
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:15,070
number and i'm going to rotate the complex number corresponding to a 30 degree rotation so i might

516
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:21,490
even just pull up yet another unit circle here and say the one that sits 30 degrees

517
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:27,850
away i want to multiply it by this number well what is that number its x component is the cosine

518
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:33,970
of that so the real component is the cosine of 30 degrees and then the imaginary component

519
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:39,490
okay the vertical component here is the sine of 30 degrees which looks like it's you know the

520
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:45,230
smaller leg of a 30 60 90 triangle which is going to be one half but we'll work out the numbers in

521
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:51,550
just a moment sine of 30 degrees times i and by the magic of complex multiplication which i hope

522
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,690
isn't magical based on what we walked through a little bit earlier the effect that this will have

523
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:02,050
is to rotate by one and then rotate by the other so what are these values cosine of 45 degrees

524
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:08,770
is the square root of 2 divided by 2 sine of 45 degrees is the square root of 2 divided by 2

525
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:13,250
and if you want to if you don't remember that and you want to work it out the way to think about it

526
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,390
is that a 45 degree angle

527
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:25,750
is going to create an isosceles right triangle so if we don't know what this side length is we at

528
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,810
least know that it's the same as the other side length so if the hypotenuse is one we know that

529
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:35,170
x squared plus x squared is supposed to equal one that's the pythagorean theorem that tells us

530
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:42,290
that 2x squared equals 1 so x squared is the square root of one half and then that's actually

531
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:48,810
the same as writing the square root of 2 divided by 2 you could also write it as 1 divided by the

532
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,650
square root of 2 if you want but these are these are equivalent forms so if you forget you just

533
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:59,150
draw the triangle it's no big deal cosine of 30 degrees well if we have our 30 60 90 triangle

534
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,250
the long side of that from everything we talked through in the last lecture is square root of 3

535
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:11,870
over 2 square root of 3 over 2 and then the sine of 30 degrees is one half and now we just carry

536
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:17,170
out the complex product it's not exactly a fun prospect maybe but it's really just four operations

537
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,510
so it's not going to be too bad the real part is going to be our cosine times our cosine okay so

538
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:31,530
that's going to end up being our square root of 2 over 2 multiplied by square root of 3 over 2

539
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:37,610
okay i'm also going to package in when we multiply both imaginary parts okay i guess i was a little

540
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:43,490
inconsistent i wrote i times sine and then sine times i but it's the same thing so i'm going to

541
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:51,410
include that square root of 2 over 2 multiplied by the one half but because each of them has an

542
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:56,290
i we also multiply it by i squared which by definition is negative 1 so we get this negative

543
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:02,830
sign in here and that's going to be the real part okay which is actually all we need we just need

544
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:09,290
the real part and that gives us the uh that gives us the x coordinate of the where did i drop before

545
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:14,910
here we go if we rotate 45 degrees then we rotate another 30 the x component of that the real part

546
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,350
is going to be the final answer so we'll do the sine part in a moment too when we make it more

547
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:24,130
general but just for the sake of answering the question this ends up being root 2 times root 3

548
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:32,190
which is root 6 divided by 2 times 2 so root 6 over 4 minus and that minus sign came about

549
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:41,090
because of the i squared minus square root of 2 over 4 okay so all in all that ends up being root

550
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:48,150
6 minus root 2 divided by 4 and if we pull up the question um i think it's very interesting that the

551
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:53,470
second most common uh answer the the most common mistake you might say is only different because

552
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:59,510
of that plus sign and if we look at the math where that came from as it happens is the idea that

553
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,870
this was a minus sign which came about from the idea that there was an i sitting in front of each

554
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:10,170
sign so the most common misconception came from maybe forgetting to apply the fact that i squared

555
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,750
is equal to negative 1 at least if you were going about it using complex numbers which from the

556
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:20,970
whole context of the lecture of course we want to so this actually corresponds to a much more general

557
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,530
formula and i think it's edifying to write out that general formula for ourselves because any

558
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:31,090
time that i've forgotten what the sum of two angles in trigonometry should be it's totally

559
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:36,170
okay because you can re-derive it relatively quickly if you're comfortable with complex

560
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:40,250
multiplication and the more math that you do because it shows up all over the place you actually

561
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:45,970
get very comfortable with complex multiplication even if you like me become very rusty on things

562
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:53,090
trigonometric identities but with that comfort you can very quickly re-derive what the angles

563
00:52:53,090 --> 00:53:00,510
should be or what the uh some some identities should be sine of beta writing and talking at

564
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:06,730
the same time so remember the way to think about this is that this first number is what we get by

565
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:15,950
uh finding a complex number that's basically just rotating alpha around the unit circle if you

566
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:25,090
rotate an angle beta around so let's say there's some other angle which i might write down here the

567
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:31,870
whole angle from the x-axis would be how should i write it i'll write it as beta that doesn't

568
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:37,050
really connote that it's the full angle just bring i'll just i'll just do it as a separate

569
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:45,930
a separate friend over here beta so i think like when i when i see these terms cosine alpha is

570
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:51,370
plus i sine alpha i think in my head very visually of a point on the unit circle in the complex plane

571
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:56,030
similarly i think of a point on the unit circle in the complex plane and i know that multiplying

572
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:01,150
them together means that the action of one of them is rotating the other so the final result

573
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:09,810
we know is going to be the point that sits alpha plus beta around alpha plus beta plus i times the

574
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:17,410
sine of alpha plus beta wonderful but on the other hand if you go through the mechanistic

575
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:22,150
foil operation you will get an alternate expression for the answer and by having an alternate

576
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:26,990
expression you have an identity which i think is pretty cool it's a sign that when you have a

577
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:31,390
non-obvious relationship like the algebra of complex multiplication and the geometry of complex

578
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:36,810
multiplication you can leverage that non-obvious relationship to get yourself real identities okay

579
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:42,190
so how does this work the real part is going to consist of multiplying those cosines so we have

580
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:50,170
cosine alpha times cosine of beta and then it also consists of the two imaginary parts multiplied

581
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:56,730
together because that i squared becomes real i times sine i'd say i won't write anything here

582
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,570
it'll be that sine of alpha and then the sine of beta

583
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:09,750
and because we have an i squared we can consider that a negative one okay so it's cosine alpha

584
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:14,610
cosine beta minus i sort of accidentally started writing a plus so we're just going to live with

585
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:22,950
that minus sine of alpha plus sine of beta sine of alpha times sine of beta okay obviously it's a

586
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,550
lot of algebra but it is satisfying the idea that you don't need to memorize this and again

587
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:31,490
when you do this regularly when you do complex multiplication regularly you can kind of see this

588
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:36,030
pop out where you're like oh yeah it's the the real the two real parts minus the two imaginary

589
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:41,490
parts that as a pattern is something you start to recognize and that when you want the imaginary

590
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:46,370
part of the product that you take the other two like in this case it's going to be i times sine

591
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:56,590
times cosine so the sine of alpha times the cosine of beta plus the cosine of alpha times the sine of

592
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:04,890
beta the cosine of alpha times the sine of beta long complicated formula all of that times i

593
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:10,570
this long complicated formula is giving you the angle and some identities and sometimes you can

594
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:15,710
write this out in a much more compact form this this is not a commonly used notation and i'll

595
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:21,610
explain why in a moment but sometimes uh cosine plus i sine of something comes about commonly

596
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:27,070
enough it has this meaning on the unit circle that it's written as c i s okay in this case

597
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:33,910
c is of alpha so everything that we just wrote down could be written more compactly as c is of

598
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:45,690
alpha times c is of beta is equal to c is of alpha plus beta okay this is communicating the very

599
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:52,750
non-trivial fact that complex multiplication lets us you know lets us work out rotations in the way

600
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:58,110
that we want to again that's not standard notation and i'll explain why there's a much more standard

601
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:02,510
way to write these but it's weird so i don't want to just kind of throw it down there but before we

602
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,790
do that i want to illustrate how you can do a little bit of magic when you have this proper

603
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:13,430
intuition for complex numbers and and how they multiply so let me pull up our quiz again and

604
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:22,350
let's move on to another question and this question asks which of the following values of

605
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:30,690
z satisfies z squared equals i okay so there's two ways that you can think about this i'll talk

606
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,770
about them both and i'm just going to give you a moment to kind of think this one through

607
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:48,530
so

608
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:52,050
and and while you work that out let me go ahead and take a question from the audience

609
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:58,650
achmed osama asks what is an application that is impossible to achieve without complex numbers

610
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:03,910
convince me that they are needed they're fun to work with maybe but they made things easier but

611
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:10,810
can we do without them um i would say i believe yeah you can absolutely work without them because

612
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:17,470
you can basically use rotation matrices in place of complex numbers so what's nice about complex

613
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,450
numbers is that when you're adding things and when you're multiplying things you're dealing with the

614
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:26,650
same type they're both complex numbers but if you wanted to describe this all with matrices and

615
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,650
vectors and such when you're adding stuff you'd be adding vectors but then when you want to do

616
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:34,770
rotation type actions and stretching type actions you'd be transferring to instead dealing with

617
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:40,790
matrices so that's fine you just have to keep that jumbled and use them differently i'd be willing to

618
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:47,790
complex numbers you could do there it'll become much less elegant and i guess one of the one of

619
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:52,990
the main things that would be just really awkward um is the fundamental theorem of algebra which

620
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:57,190
we'll talk about in a moment but it basically says anytime you have a polynomial of degree n

621
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:03,350
so the highest term you see is something like x to the n among the complex numbers it has n different

622
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:07,870
solutions so that's very elegant it's very nice to work with it definitely makes the lives easier

623
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,650
of anyone who's working with things where polynomials come about to include matrices

624
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,450
and things like i don't want to like throw around terminology but when you're computing eigenvalues

625
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:21,790
and such you find yourself with polynomials often of high degree and it's nice to have solutions to

626
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:27,330
them i can conceive of constructing some kind of way to work with the numbers where you have like

627
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:31,850
solutions to all of these where the solutions are expressed in terms of vectors and matrices

628
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,250
and so maybe the strict answer to your question is you could do without them

629
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:41,570
you definitely would not want to life for mathematicians and quantum physicists and

630
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,930
really anyone who works with like linear algebra and polynomials would just become incredibly

631
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:52,750
awkward so in some very real sense they are a natural construct so much so that even if you

632
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:58,430
could do without them conceivably you never would want to it would really make things quite the pain

633
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:04,030
so coming back to our quiz here it looks like again we've got a lot of strong consensus which

634
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:13,330
is good and let me go ahead and create this all right so the correct answer is a okay it's root

635
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:19,590
two over two plus root two over two i it looks like the majority of you got that and okay so

636
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:24,470
very interesting is that the second most common answer was d that no solution exists without

637
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:28,730
extending beyond the complex numbers because the question we're asking in this context is basically

638
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:33,890
to take a square root of i so if you think of oh i is defined to be the square root of negative one

639
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:38,270
i think a common question is to say you know how deep does this rabbit hole go okay if we had to

640
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,470
make up an answer to the question square root of negative one do we have to make up another one for

641
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,790
the square root of i and the square root of that and just kind of keep extending and extending

642
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:51,530
and it's interesting and surprising that once you have i you have pretty much everything else that

643
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,070
you want at least when it comes to solving anything that looks like a polynomial okay so

644
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:00,250
the answer here there's two ways to think about it one of them is the brute force way and then

645
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:04,490
one of them is the more elegant way so the brute force way looks like this you're reading through

646
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:08,910
the multiple choices and you just kind of try them out and in this case when you try out

647
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:16,650
square root of two over two plus square root of two over two times i and you square it

648
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:21,250
so we're going to multiply it by itself i'm going to actually do this just to illustrate that

649
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:29,250
it's possible and that it's not super fun taking root two times root two for that first real part

650
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:37,470
is going to give us two divided by two times two so two over four the real part will also include

651
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:42,170
the products of the imaginary parts because of that i squared so we're going to have root two

652
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:47,950
over two times root two over two which like we just saw oh excuse me that was supposed to be two

653
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:54,670
over four you can tell i'm a little all over the place today which you know just because sometimes

654
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:59,070
complex numbers get me excited root over two times root two over two is going to be another

655
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:04,700
two over four but this time it's times i times i so we're going to have a negative in there

656
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:11,530
okay that's going to be the full real part and then the imaginary part is going to come from

657
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:16,950
the cross terms something where there was only one i included so two over two i times root two over two

658
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,770
it's the same product we're doing over and over it's always two over four and then we're going

659
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:28,030
to add root two over two times root two over two i so we're going to add the same thing and i'm not

660
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:33,550
writing the i's here because i'm going to factor it out okay so the real part involves subtracting

661
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:38,390
these the imaginary part involves adding them and indeed when we subtract them that real part is zero

662
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:46,630
and when we add them that imaginary part is one so we just get zero plus i or i and okay it works

663
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:51,610
but imagine that you looked at this question and it wasn't multiple choice right someone asks you

664
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:57,710
to find a square root of i if the only option you have is this terrible brute forcing it seems like

665
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:03,210
a very painful process right to try every number try squaring it if this is what you have to do but

666
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:07,010
in an insane trial and error it would seem like magic if someone just pulled that answer out of

667
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:12,290
a hat but if you're thinking about it geometrically it's actually a pretty straightforward question to

668
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:19,750
ask because what you're saying is we want a number such that z squared is sitting where i is right

669
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:25,110
sitting one unit above well if we know that rotation corresponds to complex multiplication

670
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:29,750
right that means what we want is a number that rotates by 45 degrees

671
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:37,530
because if you have a number that rotates by 45 degrees then when you multiply by it twice that's

672
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:45,110
the same as rotating 90 degrees so it gets you up to i all right well what number is that we could

673
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:50,330
think of in terms of sines and cosines if we want you know this is going to be cosine of 45 degrees

674
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:59,370
this vertical part is going to be the sine of 45 degrees and it's root 2 over 2 for each of them

675
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:04,850
this is something we were working out just by looking at the the isosceles right triangle

676
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:13,350
each one of these is equal to root 2 over 2 so that's very fun simply by thinking of the geometry

677
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,570
you could pull out of your hat the fact that the square root of i

678
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:21,230
or i should say a square root of i is root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 i

679
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:27,150
another answer would have been what happens when you rotate not 45 degrees but if you were to rotate

680
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:36,750
45 plus another 180 degrees okay so 45 plus 180 actually gets us 225 degrees all the way around

681
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:41,620
that's another number where if you multiply by it twice it'll have the effect of rotating you

682
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:49,800
a grand total of 360 plus 90 degrees it'll kind of rotate you all the way around and then an extra 90

683
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:56,160
so in the same way that most positive numbers have two square roots you know square root of 25

684
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,280
is 5 but it's also negative 5 and in the same way that even negative numbers like negative 1

685
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:08,240
has two square roots not only is it i but negative i also satisfies this property that when you square

686
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:14,420
it you get negative 1 even i itself has two square roots and in general everything except for 0 has

687
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:19,700
two square roots 0 you might consider to have like a double root but again that's sort of a story for

688
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:25,280
another time so that's pretty magical and now let me show you another bit of magic okay something

689
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,740
where again you can come at a question that seems like it's going to involve just insane trial and

690
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,800
error but if you're thinking about the geometry of it you're able to come to a pretty uh a pretty

691
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:44,100
meaningful answer relatively quickly all right what's our question here the equation x cubed

692
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:51,580
equals 1 has one real number solution x equals 1 makes sense you cube 1 you get 1 among the complex

693
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:57,880
numbers there are two more solutions which of the following is one of them okay so this time it's

694
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:03,920
actually asking us to cube uh some kind of complex number or to verify that when you cube it you're

695
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,720
going to get one i'll give you some some time to sort of think about that

696
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:16,860
and in the meantime let me take a sip of water and then take the question from the audience

697
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:32,580
what do we have you showed that in order to find the cosine of a sum of two angles

698
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,880
you can multiply two complex numbers does that mean that if i need the cosine of a subtraction

699
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:43,240
of two angles i need to divide two complex numbers wonderful question yes yes it does mean

700
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:48,340
that um and dividing by a complex number is actually the same as multiplying by one in the

701
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:54,320
same way that uh dividing by two is the same as multiplying by one half you basically say two has

702
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,000
the action of stretching the number line by two um one half as a multiplier has the action of

703
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,520
squishing everything down by a factor of two that's kind of the inverse action when it comes

704
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:10,220
to complex numbers to divide by it you ask what's the inverse action so an example here might be

705
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:19,640
say let's pull up something here let's say i wanted to rotate uh you know negative alpha

706
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:25,220
that's what i want to do so i'm going to do like cosine of beta minus alpha or something like that

707
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,180
that number

708
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,160
could be considered the inverse the multiplicative inverse of what you get by rotating alpha the

709
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,140
other way so up here we have i'm just going to write it as c is for cosine plus i times the

710
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:48,980
sine of alpha the inverse number over here is c is of negative alpha right that number is one

711
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:55,240
divided by this i could even write it out over here to say c is the number that's alpha the way

712
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:04,060
along a unit circle is equal to one divided by c is of negative alpha and vice versa if i took one

713
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:12,320
divided by c is of alpha this is equal to c is of negative alpha now everyone who knows euler's

714
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,800
formula is kind of screaming at me that there's an easy way to see this um in terms of exponentials

715
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,780
which is of course where we're getting with this but because it's weird this connection between

716
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:24,400
complex numbers and exponentials i don't want to just throw that down right away i do want to

717
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:29,440
emphasize that this is this should all make sense before anything like euler's formula enters the

718
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:35,440
picture if you think of c is as being what basically a function to ask where do you end up if you walk

719
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:41,380
alpha units around the unit circle in the complex plane it's the opera it's the number that you can

720
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:48,140
use for um for rotating things by alpha degrees so dividing by it will also get you rotating the

721
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:53,040
other way but the the overall answer there is the division is the same as multiplication so that's

722
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,600
absolutely the right instinct you could derive for yourself the angle uh what would you call

723
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,100
them the trigonometric difference formulas if you wanted to great so i think that's probably enough

724
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:10,060
time if we punch back to our quiz and let's tone down the pause and ponder music here it seems like

725
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:17,020
answers have sort of stopped rolling in so this is as good a time as any to grade things so the

726
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:24,160
correct answer here um of the four options that we were given ends up being drum roll please negative

727
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:30,060
one half plus the root three over two times i now i just want you to imagine for a moment that if

728
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,540
you didn't know any of the geometry of complex numbers someone asks you this question and if

729
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:39,900
you were able to spit it back decently quickly it makes you look like a machine right because

730
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:45,000
you would imagine that the only way to answer this is to look at each number and then cube it

731
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,540
that you have to go through and do the whole first inside outside last but twice because you're

732
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:54,620
cubing it for each one of those um and then deduce that answer b turns out to have this property that

733
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:59,120
we want geometrically there's a very nice way to see it so let's go ahead and pull it up

734
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:10,820
what we want is an action so that when you do it three times you end up back at the uh back at one

735
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:15,980
basically i want if i were to multiply by this number three times i end up back at one let me

736
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:24,440
clear for myself a nice new piece of paper here so just remind ourselves what we're looking for

737
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:32,400
which is x cubed is equal to one okay so one such action is the do nothing action right if you

738
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,940
multiply by one which does nothing yeah do that three times you end up back at one that is our

739
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:43,900
real solution the other ones would be to rotate a third of the way around the circle okay to rotate

740
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:51,700
120 degrees or you could rotate 120 degrees the other way which is equivalent to thinking of

741
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:57,420
240 degrees around those are other actions where if you do them three times it's the same as doing

742
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:02,720
nothing if i rotate 120 degrees then do that three times i cube it that's the same as doing nothing

743
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,800
that's how you can read this equation which i think is very nice and elegant rather than just

744
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,900
trying to plug in numbers and see what comes out so using the trig that we learned about last time

745
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:18,340
this again comes from a 30 60 90 triangle you can see that the real part is negative one half and

746
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:23,980
the imaginary part is the square root of three over two so even before working it out i can know

747
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:28,940
with confidence that if i were to go through the painstaking process of taking negative one half

748
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:35,480
plus the square root of three over two and cubing that i'm going to get back one i don't have to go

749
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,780
through that process to know that that's going to happen which is pretty magical this also answers

750
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:46,740
for us a mystery that we had in the last lecture if you guys remember what we did is we pulled up

751
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:53,920
a Desmos so let's go on back let's go on over to chrome let's open up a Desmos tab and let's get

752
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,940
rid of whatever else was going on in here and what we played with was the idea that if you take a

753
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:04,860
cosine graph and then if you square it the shapes look remarkably similar you have this bizarre

754
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:10,160
relationship where squaring cosine looks like squishing it and more specifically we were able

755
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:15,280
to play around and say if you double the frequency of that cosine wave and then you manipulate it in

756
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,300
other ways we're going to shift it up and then we divide it by two this is all something we did

757
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:24,860
last time we got an identity between them but this raised an interesting question what on earth does

758
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:30,900
cosine of 2x have to do with cosine of x squared well now with complex numbers we can actually know

759
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:37,840
the answer we can work this out we know that if you rotate around by theta degrees okay

760
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:45,620
if we call that number z then when we rotate around another theta degrees this new number

761
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:55,360
is z squared right and z is what i was calling c is of theta which we could expand out as saying

762
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:05,660
cosine of theta plus i sine of theta and we can work out that square nearly algebraically we take

763
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:14,360
cosine of theta plus i sine of theta the real part of that is going to come from two products

764
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:21,580
of the real part so it's going to be cosine squared of theta but then also two parts of the

765
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:26,080
imaginary and because of that i it becomes negative one so we'll end up with negative

766
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:32,820
sine squared of theta and then the imaginary part is going to come from you know i might as

767
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:41,760
well just write this out in full cosine theta plus i sine i realize i'm kind of running against

768
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,180
the edge which is why i was hesitant to do this but basically that cosine squared comes from

769
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:52,280
taking the cosine times the cosine the negative sine squared comes from taking i sine times

770
01:13:52,280 --> 01:14:00,500
negative i sine our remaining terms are going to be that cosine plus i sine so cosine theta

771
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,400
times sine of theta

772
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:10,800
and then there's going to be an i i'll just write it out times i and then we get exactly the same

773
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:17,880
thing sine of theta times cosine of theta times i so sine of theta times cosine of theta

774
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:28,240
times i which we could factor out this whole last part ends up just being two times the cosine of

775
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:39,000
theta times the sine of theta right all of that times i so what we've done here is basically said

776
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,580
there's two ways to think about cosine theta plus i sine theta squared one of them is oh of course

777
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:49,340
it doubles the angle right so that's going to be cosine of two theta on the other hand algebraically

778
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:54,780
it's equal to deep breath cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta plus two cosine theta

779
01:14:55,530 --> 01:15:01,560
i now that might seem like a big pain but the big pain is showing us an identity it's showing us the

780
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:07,820
double angle identity so what we found here just to summarize on the real part is that the cosine

781
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,320
of two theta the real part of what happens when we rotate by that twice

782
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:19,510
is equal to cosine squared of theta minus sine squared of theta

783
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:27,690
so now from another trig identity that we were working with last time sine squared of theta

784
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:36,150
is actually the same as taking one minus cosine squared this was the alternate way of expressing

785
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:42,070
the pythagorean theorem so we can get everything written in terms of cosines and what we have is

786
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:49,810
now two times cosine pardon the messiness of the handwriting here by the way two times cosine of

787
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:58,290
theta all minus one that is evidently equal to the cosine of two theta and we could rearrange

788
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:03,990
that further and see what we were playing around with in desmos that this cosine of 2x expression

789
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:11,730
over here this cosine of 2x expression corresponds with squaring the cosine this was a reflection of

790
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:18,710
fact that cosine relates to complex numbers which i think is pretty cool okay and as the very last

791
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:25,150
thing that i want to mention i want to talk about why we didn't um why nobody really uses the cis

792
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:32,490
notation right i was saying that cis of alpha is not really standard notation when we're talking

793
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:39,010
about rotating alpha around the unit circle as a reminder this was my shorthand for cosine plus

794
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:46,270
i sine the reason is because what you're always going to see instead through electrical

795
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:51,090
engineering through quantum mechanics through math through all sorts of things is instead the

796
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:56,770
way that this is written is actually before i show you how it's written no no i'll just i'll

797
01:16:56,770 --> 01:17:00,230
just show you how it's written it's it's it's weird and we're going to talk about it at length

798
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:06,890
next time but you imagine that you're raising something to a power okay e to the i times alpha

799
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:11,850
now this obviously makes a lot of people very uncomfortable first of all if you don't know

800
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:17,090
about e what is e and then secondly what on earth does it mean to raise something to an imaginary

801
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:21,350
power so that is a full lecture's worth of material i do want to talk about it next time

802
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:26,530
but just to to give an indication of why this might not be a totally crazy thing

803
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:32,630
okay i want you to remember the core property that we wrote down earlier that when you rotate

804
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:39,110
alpha around the unit circle and then when you rotate another beta around the unit circle this

805
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:45,750
is the same thing as alpha plus beta which means our cis function has this kind of interesting

806
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:51,490
property that adding the inputs is the same as multiplying the outputs so with that i want to

807
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:56,550
ask one final quiz question to try to relate this to other functions that you might be familiar with

808
01:17:56,550 --> 01:18:00,850
and at this point it might be halfway obvious where we're going with this but it's the very

809
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:05,510
final question to queue you up for where we're going to go next time and maybe appreciate the

810
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:10,890
relationship at play here and why it's not that crazy i want you to answer which of the following

811
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:20,050
functions satisfies f of a plus b is equal to f of a times f of b okay

812
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:38,310
so i'm being told by the way that um when i advance the questions too quickly it kind of

813
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,270
reveals the answer of the next one which happened all throughout last lecture and you guys certainly

814
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:46,270
told me about it again this is one of those things where like this is what happens with

815
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:51,330
live production we thought we had fixed that um usually you know this is a very weird process

816
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:54,910
for me because usually when i make videos you catch some kind of error so you edit out the error

817
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:59,510
then you put out the video this is an experience for me is much more like all right world here it

818
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:04,030
is raw here are the errors as they come i hope you enjoy watching them happen because there's

819
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:11,010
no editing it does not get clipped out this is math presentation raw all right so as we do this

820
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:17,050
it looks like a pretty pretty strong consensus i'll give you a little bit more time to submit

821
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,050
answers

822
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:34,050
all right and with that let's go ahead and take a look so the question is what function has this

823
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:39,830
property where adding the inputs looks like multiplying by the outputs so uh 2700 of you

824
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:45,010
correctly answered that two to the x an exponential function behaves this way looks like the most

825
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:51,870
common second answer was a that logarithms which makes sense there's an identity in logarithms that

826
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:57,650
looks very similar it's basically the opposite so if we were to you know write this out i might say

827
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:07,030
two to the a times two to the b is equal to two to the a plus b and when we're thinking in terms

828
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:11,430
of repeated multiplication this makes a lot of sense because one of these is saying multiply in

829
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:18,270
a copies of two then multiply in b copies of two and the result should be well a plus b copies of

830
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:24,130
two the rule with logarithms is exactly the opposite and it's because logarithms are the

831
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:31,330
inverse of multiplication on that front it looks like taking the log of a plus b ends up being the

832
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:41,570
log of a sorry the log of a times b multiply log of a plus log of b logarithms is another thing i

833
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,710
think we're going to talk about in a later lecture of this series so if you don't know about them

834
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:49,290
don't worry but to those of you who answered that totally understandable it's because it's a very

835
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:53,790
similar property but it's just getting mixed up whether the outputs are being added or the inputs

836
01:20:53,790 --> 01:21:01,270
are now what you'll notice is how strange this factor that comes about because two to the x is

837
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:06,810
defined as repeated multiplication looks very similar to the rule that we found for complex

838
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:11,410
numbers that sit on the unit circle that multiplying the outputs is the same as adding the

839
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:15,650
inputs and that should be very suggestive that there might be some kind of unifying theory between

840
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:22,210
them which of course there is it has everything to do with y we write things as e to the i theta

841
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:27,870
i actually think is kind of a bad convention the good thing about it is that it does make it pretty

842
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:34,350
obvious when you take e to the i theta times e to the i beta sorry e to the i alpha that you're

843
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:39,650
allowed to just add them it really highlights that fact which otherwise you kind of have to think

844
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:42,930
through but maybe that's a good thing that you kind of have to think it through and you're not

845
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:48,250
just blindly applying rules but i'm going to talk all about that next time we're going to dig deep

846
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:53,370
into uh euler's formula a way that you can try to understand what is this really saying like

847
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:57,650
computationally it's not talking about repeated multiplication so what could you do if you are

848
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:02,990
