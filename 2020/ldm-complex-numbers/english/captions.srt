00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Today we are going to talk about one of my absolute all-time favorite pieces of math.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,977
It's incredibly fundamental to engineering, to mathematics itself, 

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:12,080
to quantum mechanics, but it's something that has a terrible, terrible name.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,080
We call them complex numbers.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,043
And worse than that, the things that bring about 

6
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,120
complex numbers we call imaginary numbers.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,217
And before we get into any of it, what I want to do is start with kind of a poll, 

8
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:28,680
just to poll the audience on seeing what you guys can consider to be, well, real.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,880
What do you consider to exist when it comes to numbers?

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
So we've already been doing a couple polls in the warm-up animations, 

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,167
but as a serious poll of sorts, one that's actually going to help me see where 

12
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,753
you're coming from before we begin the lesson here, 

13
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,040
I just want to ask you a very simple question.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,700
Okay, so let's go ahead and pull it up here.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,460
Pull it on up.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,280
And, oh, for whatever reason it seems like we're having trouble polling this one up.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,020
Okay, there we go.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,300
Took a little delay there.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,569
Among the values 2, square root of 2, square root of negative 1, and infinity, 

20
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,105
which would you personally consider to really exist, 

21
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:12,640
whatever really existing means to you?

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,060
So in theory, if you guys go to 3b1b.co slash live, you should be able to answer this, 

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,560
and then the statistics based on your answers are going to start populating the screen.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,860
We won't know what those answers refer to.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,286
At the moment, all we know is that, you know, someone who has a lead, 

26
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:31,744
another one that's pretty close behind it, and as your answers come in and 

27
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:35,340
as the servers kind of digest them, we'll start to see some of the stats here.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,783
If you go to that page, by the way, 3b1b.co slash live, which redirects to itempool.com, 

29
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:45,045
what you're going to find is at the very top, you can ask a question on Twitter, 

30
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:49,729
and all that's going to do is basically open up a tweet that's going to have the hashtag 

31
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,360
in it, lockdown math, and that's the way that we're going to be doing questions to this.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,169
Instead of a live chat, anytime you have a question or a comment that you want to, 

33
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,520
you know, insert into the lesson and let that be part of the discussion, 

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,780
it's going to be pulled up here, and it looks like we already have one.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,023
This is from Yash Dave, who asks, if you could rename the complex numbers and the 

36
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,875
so-called imaginary numbers to something more intuitive, 

37
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:16,329
to a name that conveyed the fact that they have numerous applications in the real world, 

38
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,580
what would you name them?

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,120
I couldn't be happier that you asked, Yash.

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,425
So I have one friend who seems very passionate about 

41
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,280
the fact that we should call them sneaky numbers.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,322
Personally, I'm very fond of trying to connote spinning and rotation, 

43
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,682
and this is one of the things we'll talk about in today's lesson, 

44
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:35,703
is the fact that what we call complex numbers, what we call imaginary numbers, 

45
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:39,571
some of the main uses that they have come from very elegant descriptions of 

46
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:44,000
how to rotate stuff, and I hope you'll kind of see what I mean as we proceed with that.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,342
So on our poll, asking you guys which numbers you consider to really exist, 

48
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:52,288
which is of course a subjective question, there's no right or wrong answer here, 

49
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,016
I am genuinely curious, actually, how this breaks down, 

50
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,940
because it's not at all a strong consensus in one direction.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,033
It seems like we've got three top contenders, and then three that are 

52
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:07,600
falling pretty evenly behind that, so let's go ahead and take a look.

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,140
What do you consider to really exist when it comes to numbers?

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,125
Now, I can imagine which ones might be the top two, 

55
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,805
but I'm very curious about the fact that there's three all kind of coinciding with each 

56
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:25,379
other there, and it looks like I'm getting a little bit of a delay before the reveal, 

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,720
so there's kind of this nice dramatic pause.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,892
I'll tell you, for me personally, I feel like it's very silly to 

59
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,260
answer anything that's either that's not all of them or none of them.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,706
I can maybe understand if someone wants to treat infinity as something different, 

61
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:43,802
because it's ill-defined. There's lots of different things that that might mean, 

62
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:48,354
but insofar as numbers exist at all, if you consider what a number is to be a real thing, 

63
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,298
then it would... oh man, I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one. 

64
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,889
We had fixed it by live stream too, but I guess there's going to be an 

65
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,620
oscillation between when it works and when it doesn't.

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:08,574
So, for me, I think that the question is, well, man, 

67
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:17,339
I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one.

68
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,097
t has a kind of reality in our minds, and things like the square root of two, 

69
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,892
which you can't express as a fraction, or things like the 

70
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:26,060
square root of negative one that don't show u

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:37,463
But for me personally, basically, anytime that you have a numerical 

72
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:50,040
construct that's helpful in the real world, you know, I consider that real.

73
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,996
What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you the sense in 

74
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:58,680
which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, an

75
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,128
d from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality. 

76
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:06,425
I won't assume that you know what they are yet, it's meant to be a basic primer, 

77
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:10,457
but let's just dive right in, okay? The end, by the way, the very end here, 

78
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,800
I want to talk about two different trigonometric functions, and

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:13,977
And things like the square root of 2, which you can't express as a fraction, 

80
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:14,167
or things like the square root of negative 1 that don't show up among real normal 

81
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:14,331
numbers, you know, even if they might seem a little bit different, oh, 

82
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:14,380
this is such a shame.

83
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,618
ing that we're going to build to, two identities from trigonometry, 

84
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,428
and I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry 

85
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:24,857
is not going to be the best way to lure some people into understanding, 

86
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,620
oh yeah, complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really going to love th

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,440
em. But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact tha

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,111
What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you the sense 

89
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,857
in which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, 

90
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:36,480
and from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality.

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,099
I won't assume that you know what they are yet, 

92
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:37,900
it's meant to be a basic primer, but let's just dive right in.

93
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,075
ou can have facts that are pretty hard to remember. 

94
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:43,087
I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, 

95
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:46,517
that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know, 

96
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:47,940
it's this kind of long thing in te

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,056
And I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry 

98
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:56,223
is not going to be the best way to lure some people into understanding, oh yeah, 

99
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,980
complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really going to love them.

100
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,117
But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact that has 

101
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:10,322
nothing to do with complex numbers or the square root of negative one, 

102
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:15,600
it's just trigonometry, it's everything we were talking about last time.

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,860
And you can have facts that are pretty hard to remember.

104
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,550
I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, 

105
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,752
that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know, 

106
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:30,160
it's this kind of long thing in terms of cosines and sines of the original two angles.

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,681
y who's going into serious math, they'll tell you that complex numbers are as 

108
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:38,275
real a part of their work and their life as real numbers are. 

109
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:43,028
But the starting point looks very strange, okay? When you start introducing this, 

110
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:43,840
the very first

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,483
thing you do is to say, assume that there's some number i so that 

112
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:51,181
i squared is equal to negative 1. And I think to a lot of students 

113
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:54,880
there's maybe one of two possible reactions that you can have here.

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360
It's something that's very error-prone if you're just trying to memorize it as it is.

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:12,250
However, if you come at it with complex numbers, this is not only much less error-prone, 

116
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:20,940
it has a very beautiful meaning and it just falls right out.

117
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,891
So even if you don't necessarily believe in the reality of the square root of negative 

118
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:23,495
one, you at the very least have to admit that it's interesting that it can make other 

119
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:24,100
pieces of math useful, that other pieces of math a little bit more understandable too.

120
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,913
d says, oh no no it exists, we've defined it so that that's the case. 

121
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:32,380
I think the other reaction someone can have is, hang on a second, you can do that?

122
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:42,878
If you talk to anybody who's in engineering, anybody who's going into serious math, 

123
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:50,033
they'll tell you that complex numbers are as real a part of 

124
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:55,520
their work and their life as real numbers are.

125
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:09,960
But the starting point looks very strange, okay?

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,028
do when you start talking about complex numbers is to say, 

127
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,616
there's not just such a number i, but we're going to give it a home. 

128
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:21,036
Instead of the real number line, which you know all of these numbers we know when we 

129
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:23,220
square them, you can't get a negative, wha

130
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,889
t we do is say i lives in a different dimension. i lives perpendicularly, 

131
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:33,000
there's one above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negati

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,316
ve 2i, you scale it however you want. Essentially it's proposing that 

133
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,262
numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very specific home, 

134
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:45,640
one unit perpendicular, uh, perpendicularly above the real number line.

135
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,814
Any time I square a number, even if it's negative, 

136
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:53,260
if I take negative five for example and I square it, 

137
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,160
well a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25.

138
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:14,560
Any number that you square, if it's positive, well that just stays positive.

139
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:35,920
So it seems like no matter what, when I'm squaring numbers I always get a positive number.

140
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:53,520
I'm never going to get anything negative.

141
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,480
and then you move in that perpendicular direction into the extension of our number s

142
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,123
ystem, which again, you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here 

143
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:04,680
that you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,820
I think the other reaction someone can have is, hang on a second, you can do that?

145
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,655
When you have a problem that you can't solve you can just say, 

146
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,520
oh I've defined things so that we now magically have a solution.

147
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,583
Okay, next time I'm having trouble with my homework and I don't know what the answer 

148
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,660
to x is, I will be like, let x be the value defined to be the answer to this question.

149
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:29,280
So if you're uncomfortable with this, you're definitely not alone.

150
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,820
In fact, Rene Descartes coined the term imaginary for these numbers as a derogatory.

151
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,124
It was meant to make fun of the fact that obviously there 

152
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:30,440
is no such answer and it shouldn't be taken as serious math.

153
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,298
And then we stuck with that as a convention and we still call them imaginary numbers, 

154
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:32,860
which is genuinely absurd.

155
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,805
like there's a, there's a back and forth between answers f and d, 

156
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:41,169
so f is all of them, saying that all of these should be considered real. 

157
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,740
And interesting, d is the one that says you

158
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,059
The second weird thing that you do when you start talking about complex numbers 

159
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,280
is to say, there's not just a number i, but we're going to give it a home.

160
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,019
Instead of the real number line, which you know, 

161
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,268
all of these numbers we know when we square them, you can't get a negative, 

162
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:56,120
what we do is say i lives in a different dimension.

163
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,520
i lives perpendicularly.

164
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:08,940
There's one above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negative 2i.

165
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:19,840
You scale it however you want.

166
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,069
Essentially it's proposing that numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very 

167
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,300
specific home, one unit perpendicular perpendicularly above the real number line.

168
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:30,049
And okay, if we want to extend our number system, I get it, 

169
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:41,220
maybe it's useful to put some kind of number up there, but why i, right?

170
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,559
Why not say infinity is the number that sits one unit above zero, 

171
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,838
or one divided by zero, or any other problem that you couldn't 

172
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,260
solve before and you make up an answer to, why should that live there?

173
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,040
What on earth does the idea of a point one unit above the real number 

174
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,820
line in a separate dimension have to do with squaring to negative one?

175
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:57,020
So I hope to answer this for you.

176
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,056
At the very beginning, let's just talk about how if you're adding numbers that 

177
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:07,412
are two-dimensional like this, the rules are pretty straightforward and it operates 

178
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:12,640
essentially the same as vectors for any of you who might be familiar with vectors.

179
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,881
So I guess I can pull it up on the, just on the piece of paper, 

180
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:20,409
and you can follow along at home, see what the addition might be. 

181
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:24,740
It turns out to be relatively straightforward. If you're moving four units to the

182
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:36,630
And then I'm going to take a second number and it's helpful to draw them as vectors, 

183
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:45,164
kind of an arrow from the number zero, and this one is going 

184
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,340
to end up at negative two plus two i.

185
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:58,446
So what I'm saying is you take the real number negative two and then you move in 

186
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:05,089
that perpendicular direction into the extension of our number system, 

187
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:12,680
which again you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here that 

188
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:20,651
you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers extend 

189
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,360
in this direction.

190
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,421
can get you something like it. But the rules end up being very different 

191
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,979
from that in the number system. You can't really do algebra. 

192
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:31,125
You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, 

193
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:31,880
then one of them h

194
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,099
as to be zero. But complex numbers are going to 

195
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,180
end up behaving much like the real numbers, s

196
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,550
Now assuming that our question system has not broken down, 

197
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,558
I should be able to do this as a proper poll and let me go ahead, 

198
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:55,114
I guess we can first check the previous poll, okay things seem to be working so we 

199
00:13:55,114 --> 00:14:01,759
can take a little step back in the lesson so I'm just genuinely curious, 

200
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,220
I want to know how you guys answered on this one.

201
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,640
It looks like there's a there's a back and forth between answers f and d, 

202
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,914
so f is all of them saying that all of these should be considered real, 

203
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:23,214
and interesting d is the one that says you should consider two square root of two and 

204
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:29,587
negative one but not infinity, so there's a good contingent of you out there who would 

205
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:35,960
just reject infinity as being considered real but are very comfortable with the square 

206
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,454
root of negative one, that's awesome, and then after that it looks like c, 

207
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:46,142
people who reject the square root of negative one, fascinating, 

208
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:52,148
I actually would have thought that none of them would have come higher than that, 

209
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:58,594
none of them is much lower at a, okay so it looks like we've got a cohort of people who 

210
00:14:58,594 --> 00:15:04,674
are comfortable with negative one, a large cohort are uncomfortable with infinity, 

211
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:08,630
that's a topic for another day, don't worry about it, 

212
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,856
and then a number of people who are kind of in that middle ground of maybe not being 

213
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:19,618
super comfortable with the idea that negative one might be real, 

214
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,940
let's see if we can convince you of the difference of that.

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:37,778
So what we've done here is we've taken three, two and then we convert it to negative two, 

216
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:47,886
three. Something which maybe in our original system you know looks 

217
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:53,620
like this negative two and then three.

218
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,109
Before I've taught you how to add them, make a guess at how it might work, 

219
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:59,389
and I hope that it feels pretty straightforward, 

220
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,553
addition is actually the least interesting part of this, but it is, 

221
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,810
it's a good thing to know when you're learning about complex numbers, 

222
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,300
it's definitely one of those operations that you are going to need to know.

223
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:17,852
Unfortunately, and you can tell by the fact that I'm stalling and what I'm saying here, 

224
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:24,654
it looks like the question is still not loading completely correctly, 

225
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:31,457
so I'm going to have a stern word with Cam and Ider behind the scenes 

226
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:38,260
who have otherwise built such a beautiful, beautiful interface that's 

227
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:44,480
helpful for this kind of back and forth between you guys and me.

228
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,054
nice gut check here is to say what happens when we do that twice what 

229
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:49,481
if we do that same very mechanistic operation again twice and I'm 

230
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:52,092
going to go and take this I swap the two coordinates we get a negative 

231
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:54,520
b but then that first one becomes negative. So that was another 90

232
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:08,680
degree rotation. Well what's happened here is we've just made both of the coordinates 

233
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:21,359
negative and that's reassuring because if I take some point sitting at a b an

234
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:28,500
It turns out to be relatively straightforward.

235
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,572
h is just taking both of the coordinates and making them negative negative a 

236
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:36,486
negative b okay so that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree 

237
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:40,981
rotation actually behaves like you would expect it to. Now why am I asking you this? 

238
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:45,160
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again so I

239
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,149
'm going to have you do your very first complex product. 

240
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,981
Oh look a lot of people did submit answers very good. 

241
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:54,180
Great let's let's grade the complex addition actually let's l

242
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,205
et's see if it is as straightforward a process as I was hoping it was and see 

243
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,230
how much explanation is demanded. Okay so it looks like a majority of you did 

244
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,892
get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i. Very good very good. 

245
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,917
52 of you answered simply 2 which would have been the real part of the answer 

246
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,890
so maybe just the fact that there's some vertical component and you need to 

247
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,280
still add those

248
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:14,110
vertical components or maybe those of you who answer 2 reject the reality of 

249
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:23,940
imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical component.

250
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,740
Addition doesn't really have anything complicated going on, which is great.

251
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,020
s just making that's just swapping up whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus

252
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,880
4 so that's completely understandable. We've got 2 plus 3 which is maybe just dropping

253
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,310
Well where everything becomes interesting is when 

254
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,680
you try to multiply these numbers together.

255
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,820
So with vectors, there's not really any notion of multiplying 

256
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,100
them to get two vectors back, at least when we're in the 2d plane.

257
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,711
that we ask questions and just say hey kamineter can't you make the live questions 

258
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:40,342
work a little bit better for us? Okay I think we're finally there. Everybody ready? 

259
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:41,780
Aha! Wonderful! Very simple question I want you to take the number i and I

260
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:53,700
want you to multiply it by 3 plus 2i and even though I haven't really talked about

261
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,564
You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, 

262
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:03,882
then one of them has to be zero, but complex numbers are going to end up behaving 

263
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:08,162
much like the real numbers, so rules from algebra can carry over, 

264
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:13,091
but to understand what that rotation rule is, oh no I'm giving things away, 

265
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:18,020
what that multiplication rule is, I just want to ask you a simple question, 

266
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,976
which is basically suppose I have the point three two, okay, 

267
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:26,127
we're not even going to think of it as a complex number per se, 

268
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:31,574
if I just have some sort of coordinate grid and I go to the point with x coordinate 

269
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:35,920
three and y coordinate two, what is the 90 degree rotation of this?

270
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:35,920
If I rotate it 90 degrees and let's say counterclockwise, 

271
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:35,920
counter, counter, jeez, writing is difficult, counterclockwise.

272
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Okay, now what's lovely about this is we can basically 

273
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:35,920
just turn our paper to figure it out.

274
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,565
ons as you do it rather than sitting in passively watching this is genuinely 

275
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:41,004
delightful to me. Okay this is this isn't necessarily a question I was 

276
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:43,649
expecting to divide the audience necessarily so unsurprisingly it looks like 

277
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,157
we have a very strong majority in one direction hopefully in the correct 

278
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:48,940
direction but if not that would that would heavily inform where the lesson should

279
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:59,741
So what we've done here is we've taken three two and then we convert it to 

280
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:10,686
negative two three, something which maybe in our original system, you know, 

281
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:23,360
looks like this, negative two and then three, that's going to be the 90 degree rotation.

282
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,493
it looks like the majority of you answered negative two plus three i 

283
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,686
which is absolutely correct absolutely correct so there's two ways to 

284
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:36,060
think about this okay one of them is to walk forward with the algebra and

285
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:42,575
just do it a little bit mechanistically okay so if we pull ourselves up our sheet if 

286
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:49,015
we take i times three plus two i three plus two i it just distributes i times three 

287
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:55,607
is going to be three i i times two i is going to be two times i squared by definition 

288
00:20:55,607 --> 00:21:02,200
i squared is negative one which means that our final answer is going to look like nega

289
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,260
That's a 90 degree rotation.

290
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,544
like I said it looks like a majority of you correctly did that product now it's one 

291
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:12,879
thing to just walk through it mechanistically it's another to step back and say what 

292
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:16,960
just happened geometrically right because what we just talked through was the fa

293
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,600
ct that if you want to rotate numbers 90 degrees the rule 

294
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,320
is to swap the two coordinates and then multiply that first

295
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,555
one by negative two well look at what's happened here we've got three 

296
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:38,701
and two those coordinates have been swapped two is now the real part 

297
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:44,937
three is the imaginary part but that two got multiplied by a negative 

298
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:51,440
one because i has this defining feature of squaring to become negative on

299
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,828
e so that should give you some indication that okay multiplying 

300
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:56,180
by i has this action of rotating things by 90 degrees maybe tha

301
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,938
Well what's happened here is we've just made both of the coordinates negative 

302
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:05,636
and that's reassuring because if I take some point sitting at a b and then I 

303
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:09,846
rotate it 90 degrees, so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation, 

304
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:14,543
and then another 90 degrees that's the same as a 180 degree roto- oh no I've 

305
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,520
done that wrong.

306
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,307
have a number that behaves this way it gives you a computational mechanism for all 

307
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:29,259
of the other types of rotations that you might want to do that might not necessarily 

308
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:35,965
be 90 degrees and to show you why this works i'm going to go ahead and pull up an 

309
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:43,080
animation so let's say we have any number z and in this case z is going to be let's see

310
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,114
where do i have it z is going to be at two uh plus i great and let's 

311
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:43,148
say i want to understand what is multiplying by z due to every other 

312
00:22:43,148 --> 00:22:43,180
possible complex number well we can go one by one the very first

313
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,669
So that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree 

314
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:53,780
rotation actually behaves like you would expect it to.

315
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:11,060
ask what is z times one where does it take the number one well z times one is going to be

316
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:21,957
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again, 

317
00:23:21,957 --> 00:23:30,560
so I'm going to have you do your very first complex product.

318
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:38,889
tch that arrow up to the point where z is great a kind of 

319
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:48,080
trivial fact even though it's trivial i'm actually going to take

320
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:57,205
a moment to write that down just so that we can oh no no no that's for that's for 

321
00:23:57,205 --> 00:24:06,107
later that is randy don't you guys worry about him he'll be coming in in just a 

322
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:15,677
moment so i just want to write down three crucial facts that are getting an influence 

323
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:24,580
rotation three facts i'll call it three facts about multiplication the first two

324
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:33,312
Okay so it looks like a majority of you did get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i, 

325
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:35,420
very good, very good.

326
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,093
52 of you answered simply 2 which would have been the real part of the answer so 

327
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,700
maybe just the fact that there's some vertical component and you need to still 

328
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,275
add those vertical components or maybe those of you who answered 2 reject the 

329
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,180
reality of imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical component.

330
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,091
hatever the 90 degree rotation point for z itself is okay so 

331
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:47,988
two down infinitely many to go okay we know what it does to 

332
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:48,960
one we know what it does to i let's see if we can understand what

333
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,491
z does to any other possible number well it turns out those two is really 

334
00:24:54,491 --> 00:25:00,098
all we need to work with if we have the distributive property so the third 

335
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:05,405
fact that's going to look kind of innocuous is let's say i take this z 

336
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:10,563
and i multiply it by c plus d times i where c and d are just any two 

337
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:16,320
numbers okay well this is going to distribute so z times c i'm actually going

338
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,783
to write that a little differently i'm going to write it as c times z plus z times 

339
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,306
di which again i'm going to write in kind of a funny order and write that as d times 

340
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:23,740
z i now the idea here is well we know where z is we also know where z times i is s

341
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:33,881
o if we're just scaling them up by some other constants that 

342
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:45,020
completely constrains where we need to go so let me go ahead and wr

343
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:56,467
ite this down with an example okay let's say that we go back here and i want to know 

344
00:25:56,467 --> 00:26:07,780
what multiplying by z does to anything i want to tell i want to convince you that it

345
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,360
Stal, stal, words, words.

346
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,235
n a way that keeps these lines parallel it keeps them evenly spaced keeps them 

347
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,329
perpendicular to each other it applies this very constrained rule to the whole plane 

348
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,313
and really just think through any one particular point for this let's say that we 

349
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:20,407
have two times negative i okay so you move two units in the positive right direction 

350
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:23,392
and then negative one unit in the vertical direction well after the product where 

351
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:26,376
that's going to land has to be two times wherever z lands plus negative one times 

352
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:26,850
wherever i la

353
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:34,679
nds okay and we see that right it's two times this 

354
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:42,970
yellow vector and it'll be negative one times the gree

355
00:26:42,970 --> 00:27:00,110
n vector so here even before you actually work out the product we could just read off

356
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,750
Aha wonderful.

357
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:14,690
Very simple question.

358
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,092
which says what is two plus i times two minus i and if you have notes 

359
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:15,512
right now if you have a pencil and paper which i encourage you to always 

360
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:15,926
come to class with i want you to try working it out do the first inside 

361
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:16,370
outside last distribution property just to see mechanistically what number en

362
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,094
ds up popping out from this and then we'll try to see how that squares with the 

363
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:23,680
geometric intuition so while you're doing that while you're working that out 

364
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,544
hopefully on pencil and paper it looks like we've got a question from the audience 

365
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:31,270
which is is i the same as i and j the vectors in physics great question actually

366
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,270
That's the only special thing you need to know about that.

367
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:39,452
Other than that just treat it like it's a normal 

368
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:48,470
number okay and then proceed forward with the product.

369
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,056
Wonderful okay so it looks like we've got quite a 

370
00:27:54,056 --> 00:28:00,090
few of you coming in to answer which is always lovely.

371
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,006
Super exciting for me by the way just how many people are enthusiastic 

372
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:09,923
about coming and like getting back to the fundamentals of math in this 

373
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:15,186
lockdown and just you know we're gonna sit back for an hour and we're gonna 

374
00:28:15,186 --> 00:28:20,103
learn about complex numbers and we're actually gonna participate we're 

375
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:25,990
actually gonna answer questions as you do rather than sitting and passively watching.

376
00:28:25,990 --> 01:22:10,370
This is genuinely delightful to me.
