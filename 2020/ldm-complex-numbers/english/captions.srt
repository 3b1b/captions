00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Today we are going to talk about one of my absolute all-time favorite pieces of math.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,977
It's incredibly fundamental to engineering, to mathematics itself, 

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:12,080
to quantum mechanics, but it's something that has a terrible, terrible name.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,080
We call them complex numbers.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,043
And worse than that, the things that bring about 

6
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,120
complex numbers we call imaginary numbers.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,217
And before we get into any of it, what I want to do is start with kind of a poll, 

8
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:28,680
just to poll the audience on seeing what you guys can consider to be, well, real.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,880
What do you exist when it comes to numbers?

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
So we've already been doing a couple polls in the warm-up animations, 

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,167
but as a serious poll of sorts, one that's actually going to help me see where 

12
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,753
you're coming from before we begin the lesson here, 

13
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,040
I just want to ask you a very simple question.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,700
Okay, so let's go ahead and pull it up here.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,460
Pull it on up.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,280
And, oh, for whatever reason it seems like we're having trouble polling this one up.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,020
Okay, there we go.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,300
Took a little delay there.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,569
Among the values 2, square root of 2, square root of negative 1, and infinity, 

20
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,105
which would you personally consider to really exist, 

21
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:12,640
whatever really existing means to you?

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,060
So in theory, if you guys go to 3b1b.co slash live, you should be able to answer this, 

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,560
and then the statistics based on your answers are going to start populating the screen.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,860
We won't know what those answers refer to.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,286
At the moment, all we know is that, you know, someone who has a lead, 

26
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:31,744
another one that's pretty close behind it, and as your answers come in and 

27
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:35,340
as the servers kind of digest them, we'll start to see some of the stats here.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,783
If you go to that page, by the way, 3b1b.co slash live, which redirects to itempool.com, 

29
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:45,045
what you're going to find is at the very top, you can ask a question on Twitter, 

30
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:49,729
and all that's going to do is basically open up a tweet that's going to have the hashtag 

31
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,360
in it, lockdown math, and that's the way that we're going to be doing questions to this.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,169
Instead of a live chat, anytime you have a question or a comment that you want to, 

33
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,520
you know, insert into the lesson and let that be part of the discussion, 

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,780
it's going to be pulled up here, and it looks like we already have one.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,023
This is from Yash Dave, who asks, if you could rename the complex numbers and the 

36
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,875
so-called imaginary numbers to something more intuitive, 

37
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:16,329
to a name that conveyed the fact that they have numerous applications in the real world, 

38
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,580
what would you name them?

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,120
I couldn't be happier that you asked, Yash.

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,425
So I have one friend who seems very passionate about 

41
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,280
the fact that we should call them sneaky numbers.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,322
Personally, I'm very fond of trying to connote spinning and rotation, 

43
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,682
and this is one of the things we'll talk about in today's lesson, 

44
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:35,703
is the fact that what we call complex numbers, what we call imaginary numbers, 

45
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:39,571
some of the main uses that they have come from very elegant descriptions of 

46
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:44,000
how to rotate stuff, and I hope you'll kind of see what I mean as we proceed with that.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,342
So on our poll, asking you guys which numbers you consider to really exist, 

48
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:52,288
which is of course a subjective question, there's no right or wrong answer here, 

49
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,016
I am genuinely curious, actually, how this breaks down, 

50
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,940
because it's not at all a strong consensus in one direction.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,033
It seems like we've got three top contenders, and then three that are 

52
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:07,600
falling pretty evenly behind that, so let's go ahead and take a look.

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,140
What do you consider to really exist when it comes to numbers?

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,125
Now, I can imagine which ones might be the top two, 

55
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,805
but I'm very curious about the fact that there's three all kind of coinciding with each 

56
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:25,379
other there, and it looks like I'm getting a little bit of a delay before the reveal, 

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,720
so there's kind of this nice dramatic pause.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,892
I'll tell you, for me personally, I feel like it's very silly to 

59
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,260
answer anything that's either that's not all of them or none of them.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,363
I can maybe understand if someone wants to treat infinity as something different 

61
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:45,166
because it's ill-defined, there's lots of different things that that might mean, 

62
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:49,316
but insofar as numbers exist at all, if you have a number of numbers, 

63
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,740
you can't really answer.

64
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,224
So, for me, I think that the question is, well, man, 

65
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,680
I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,190
We had fixed it by live stream, too, but I guess there's going 

67
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,620
to be an oscillation between when it works and when it doesn't.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,425
But for me personally, basically, anytime that you have a numerical 

69
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:07,600
construct that's helpful in the real world, you know, I consider that real.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,702
I would say that if it's something that's actually useful in an application, 

71
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:13,740
then it is as real as words are, right?

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,057
You're never going to run into an abstract word like happiness out there, 

73
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,940
but it has a kind of reality in our minds.

74
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,611
And things like the square root of 2, which you can't express as a fraction, 

75
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:27,819
or things like the square root of negative 1 that don't show up among real normal 

76
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:31,462
numbers, you know, even if they might seem a little bit different, oh, 

77
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:32,540
this is such a shame.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,020
I'm genuinely curious to see what your answers are, but it's not showing up for me, 

79
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,172
which I suppose means we'll have to move on with the lesson, 

80
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:44,720
but this will presumably begin working by the end and we can maybe pull things up again.

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,040
So let me go ahead and take that away.

82
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,477
What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you the sense 

83
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:57,837
in which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, 

84
00:04:57,837 --> 00:05:00,960
and from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality.

85
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,712
I won't assume that you know what they are yet, 

86
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,880
it's meant to be a basic primer, but let's just dive right in.

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,514
Okay, the end, by the way, the very end here, I want to talk about 

88
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:13,781
two different trigonometric functions, and this is kind of the 

89
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,360
thing that we're going to build to, two identities from trigonometry.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,780
And I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry 

91
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,567
is not going to be the best way to lure some people into understanding, oh yeah, 

92
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,980
complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really going to love them.

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,730
But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact that has 

94
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,495
nothing to do with complex numbers or the square root of negative one, 

95
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:37,300
it's just trigonometry, it's everything we were talking about last time.

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,520
And you can have facts that are pretty hard to remember.

97
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,963
I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, 

98
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:46,749
that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know, 

99
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:50,720
it's this kind of long thing in terms of cosines and sines of the original two angles.

100
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,360
There's this minus sign that would always trip people up.

101
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,350
If you do the same for the sine, it looks similar, 

102
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,980
but there's a plus sign, and instead of having cos cos, you have cosine.

103
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,620
It's something that's very error-prone if you're just trying to memorize it as it is.

104
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,531
However, if you come at it with complex numbers, this is not only much less error-prone, 

105
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:11,600
it has a very beautiful meaning and it just falls right out.

106
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,171
So even if you don't necessarily believe in the reality of the square root of negative 

107
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:20,195
one, you at the very least have to admit that it's interesting that it can make other 

108
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:24,220
pieces of math useful, that other pieces of math a little bit more understandable too.

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,660
And trigonometry is just the tip of the iceberg.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,035
If you talk to anybody who's in engineering, anybody who's going into serious math, 

111
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:35,060
they'll tell you that complex numbers are as real a part of 

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,380
their work and their life as real numbers are.

113
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,940
But the starting point looks very strange, okay?

114
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,645
When you start introducing this, the very first thing you do is to say, 

115
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:50,100
assume that there's some number i so that i squared is equal to negative one.

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,900
And I think to a lot of students there's maybe one 

117
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,880
of two possible reactions that you can have here.

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,620
One is, no there isn't, right?

119
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,518
Any time I square a number, even if it's negative, 

120
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:03,427
if I take negative five for example and I square it, 

121
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,720
well a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25.

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,480
Any number that you square, if it's positive, well that just stays positive.

123
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,300
So it seems like no matter what, when I'm squaring numbers I always get a positive number.

124
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,860
I'm never going to get anything negative.

125
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,940
So this does not exist, no such number.

126
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,306
However, if a mathematician comes and says, oh no it exists, 

127
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,340
we've defined it so that that's the case.

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,380
I think the other reaction someone can have is, hang on a second, you can do that?

129
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,340
When you have a problem that you can't solve you can just say, 

130
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,860
oh I've defined things so that we now magically have a solution.

131
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,029
Okay, next time I'm having trouble with my homework and I don't know what the answer 

132
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,600
to x is, I will be like, let x be the value defined to be the answer to this question.

133
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,460
So if you're uncomfortable with this, you're definitely not alone.

134
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,520
In fact, Rene Descartes coined the term imaginary for these numbers as a derogatory.

135
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,218
It was meant to make fun of the fact that obviously there 

136
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,700
is no such answer and it shouldn't be taken as serious math.

137
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,662
And then we stuck with that as a convention and we still call them imaginary numbers, 

138
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,740
which is genuinely absurd.

139
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,500
But that's not the only weird assumption that we make.

140
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,636
The second weird thing that you do when you start talking about complex numbers 

141
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:16,240
is to say, there's not just a number i, but we're going to give it a home.

142
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,314
Instead of the real number line, which you know, 

143
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:23,183
all of these numbers we know when we square them, you can't get a negative, 

144
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:25,780
what we do is say i lives in a different dimension.

145
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,040
i lives perpendicularly.

146
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,600
There's one above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negative 2i.

147
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,080
You scale it however you want.

148
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,710
Essentially it's proposing that numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very 

149
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,640
specific home, one unit perpendicular perpendicularly above the real number line.

150
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
And okay, if we want to extend our number system, I get it, 

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,300
maybe it's useful to put some kind of number up there, but why i, right?

152
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,062
Why not say infinity is the number that sits one unit above zero, 

153
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:02,310
or one divided by zero, or any other problem that you couldn't 

154
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,920
solve before and you make up an answer to, why should that live there?

155
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,580
What on earth does the idea of a point one unit above the real number 

156
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,940
line in a separate dimension have to do with squaring to negative one?

157
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,280
So I hope to answer this for you.

158
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,969
At the very beginning, let's just talk about how if you're adding numbers that 

159
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:24,871
are two-dimensional like this, the rules are pretty straightforward and it operates 

160
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:28,680
essentially the same as vectors for any of you who might be familiar with vectors.

161
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,327
So let's say hypothetically I have a number, oh I don't know, 

162
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:38,880
let me draw one here that's going to be four plus i, okay?

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,522
And then I'm going to take a second number and it's helpful to draw them as vectors, 

164
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:48,068
kind of an arrow from the number zero, and this one is going 

165
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:50,220
to end up at negative two plus two i.

166
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,288
So what I'm saying is you take the real number negative two and then you move in 

167
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:57,458
that perpendicular direction into the extension of our number system, 

168
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,080
which again you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here that 

169
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,884
you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers extend 

170
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:05,700
in this direction.

171
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,956
If you take that on faith and you follow, hopefully the fact that 

172
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:11,740
it becomes useful helps to justify why we're doing any of this.

173
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,480
So my question for you is simply what happens when we add these two numbers?

174
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,045
Now assuming that our question system has not broken down, 

175
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,161
I should be able to do this as a proper poll and let me go ahead, 

176
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:26,080
I guess we can first check the previous poll, okay things seem to be working so we 

177
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,526
can take a little step back in the lesson so I'm just genuinely curious, 

178
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:31,840
I want to know how you guys answered on this one.

179
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,796
It looks like there's a there's a back and forth between answers f and d, 

180
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:39,218
so f is all of them saying that all of these should be considered real, 

181
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:43,304
and interesting d is the one that says you should consider two square root of two and 

182
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:47,439
negative one but not infinity, so there's a good contingent of you out there who would 

183
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,573
just reject infinity as being considered real but are very comfortable with the square 

184
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:55,137
root of negative one, that's awesome, and then after that it looks like c, 

185
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:58,179
people who reject the square root of negative one, fascinating, 

186
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:02,075
I actually would have thought that none of them would have come higher than that, 

187
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:06,257
none of them is much lower at a, okay so it looks like we've got a cohort of people who 

188
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:10,201
are comfortable with negative one, a large cohort are uncomfortable with infinity, 

189
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,768
that's a topic for another day, don't worry about it, 

190
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:16,807
and then a number of people who are kind of in that middle ground of maybe not being 

191
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,896
super comfortable with the idea that negative one might be real, 

192
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,700
let's see if we can convince you of the difference of that.

193
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,045
So for our first much more mathematical question, 

194
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:29,300
as kind of a warm-up, I just want to ask you to add these two.

195
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,385
Before I've taught you how to add them, make a guess at how it might work, 

196
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,898
and I hope that it feels pretty straightforward, 

197
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:39,384
addition is actually the least interesting part of this, but it is, 

198
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:42,974
it's a good thing to know when you're learning about complex numbers, 

199
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:46,820
it's definitely one of those operations that you are going to need to know.

200
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,322
Unfortunately, and you can tell by the fact that I'm stalling and what I'm saying here, 

201
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:55,888
it looks like the question is still not loading completely correctly, 

202
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:59,454
so I'm going to have a stern word with Cam and Ider behind the scenes 

203
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:03,019
who have otherwise built such a beautiful, beautiful interface that's 

204
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,280
helpful for this kind of back and forth between you guys and me.

205
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna have a stern word with them behind the scenes, 

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,640
but in the meantime, let's go ahead and move forward with the lesson here.

207
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,664
So I guess I can pull it up on the, just on the piece of paper, 

208
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:19,920
and you can follow along at home, see what the addition might be.

209
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,100
It turns out to be relatively straightforward.

210
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,063
If you're moving four units to the right and then one unit up, 

211
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:30,228
and you want to add the idea of moving two units to the left and then two units up, 

212
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,460
well you just do each of those one at a time.

213
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,240
I'll go ahead and pull out black here.

214
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,744
The real part is going to be those four to the right, then minus two to the left, 

215
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:44,669
okay, straightforward enough, and then the imaginary part is going to be this one 

216
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:50,015
unit up and then these two units up, one plus two, times i, so is that one i plus two i, 

217
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:54,640
and then when you work that out four minus two is two, one plus two is three.

218
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,580
A nice simple introduction here.

219
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,440
Addition doesn't really have anything complicated going on, which is great.

220
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,200
That means that it's one fewer thing for us to worry about.

221
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,100
What is so complex about complex numbers after all?

222
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,951
Well where everything becomes interesting is when 

223
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:11,940
you try to multiply these numbers together.

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,406
So with vectors, there's not really any notion of multiplying 

225
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:18,500
them to get two vectors back, at least when we're in the 2d plane.

226
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,517
You have some notions like cross products and dot products that 

227
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,714
in three dimensions can get you something like it, 

228
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:26,860
but the rules end up being very different from that in the number system.

229
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,920
You can't really do algebra.

230
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,550
You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, 

231
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,306
then one of them has to be zero, but complex numbers are going to end up behaving 

232
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:41,134
much like the real numbers, so rules from algebra can carry over, 

233
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:45,542
but to understand what that rotation rule is, oh no I'm giving things away, 

234
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:49,951
what that multiplication rule is, I just want to ask you a simple question, 

235
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,489
which is basically suppose I have the point three two, okay, 

236
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:57,201
we're not even going to think of it as a complex number per se, 

237
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:02,073
if I just have some sort of coordinate grid and I go to the point with x coordinate 

238
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:05,960
three and y coordinate two, what is the 90 degree rotation of this?

239
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,421
If I rotate it 90 degrees and let's say counterclockwise, 

240
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:19,440
counter, counter, jeez, writing is difficult, counterclockwise.

241
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,293
Okay, now what's lovely about this is we can basically 

242
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,320
just turn our paper to figure it out.

243
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,252
We say okay if it started at three two and then I rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, 

244
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:39,654
I can just read that off now as being negative two in the x direction and then 

245
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:43,500
three in the y direction, if I had rotated the whole plane like that.

246
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,044
So what we've done here is we've taken three two and then we convert it to 

247
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:54,075
negative two three, something which maybe in our original system, you know, 

248
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:59,900
looks like this, negative two and then three, that's going to be the 90 degree rotation.

249
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,447
And what's nice here is that that rule is very 

250
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:05,320
simple and it applies to any pair that we might have.

251
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,653
If I took a pair of numbers a comma b, okay, and then I said where is 

252
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,708
that going to rotate to if I rotate it 90 degrees, 

253
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,842
it's going to end up by swapping the coordinates b a and then making 

254
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,280
that first one negative.

255
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,460
That's a 90 degree rotation.

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,940
And a nice gut check here is to say what happens when we do that twice?

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,520
What if we do that same very mechanistic operation again twice?

258
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,279
And I'm going to go and take this, I swap the two coordinates, 

259
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,980
we get a negative b, but then that first one becomes negative.

260
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,640
So that was another 90 degree rotation.

261
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,376
Well what's happened here is we've just made both of the coordinates negative 

262
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:48,210
and that's reassuring because if I take some point sitting at a b and then I 

263
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,541
rotate it 90 degrees, so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation, 

264
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:57,375
and then another 90 degrees that's the same as a 180 degree roto- oh no I've 

265
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,380
done that wrong.

266
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,386
That will be the same as a 180 degree rotation which should look like this, 

267
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:08,139
ignore the other vector that I drew, which is just taking both 

268
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,760
of the coordinates and making them negative.

269
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,840
Negative a negative b, okay.

270
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,690
So that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree 

271
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,140
rotation actually behaves like you would expect it to.

272
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,760
Now why am I asking you this?

273
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,650
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again, 

274
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,800
so I'm going to have you do your very first complex product.

275
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,700
Oh look a lot of people did submit answers, very good.

276
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,640
Great let's grade the complex addition actually, 

277
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,576
let's see if it is as straightforward a process as I was hoping it was and see 

278
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,220
how much explanation is demanded.

279
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,764
Okay so it looks like a majority of you did get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i, 

280
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:48,900
very good, very good.

281
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,086
52 of you answered simply 2 which would have been the real part of the answer so 

282
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,799
maybe just the fact that there's some vertical component and you need to still 

283
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,464
add those vertical components or maybe those of you who answered 2 reject the 

284
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:04,599
reality of imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical component.

285
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,942
Some of you answered negative 2 3 which I guess is just making- that's just swapping 

286
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:16,380
up whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus 4 so that's completely understandable.

287
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,391
We've got 2 plus 3 which is maybe just dropping off the i so I think maybe 

288
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:25,131
a lot of like simple errors and entry and you know that happens to all of 

289
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,872
us especially on tests is sometimes you know what the right answer is but 

290
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:32,360
then you you forget a symbol or you swap two so that's all very good.

291
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,860
Let's go ahead and try our very first product though like I said.

292
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,681
So here because I already talked through one of the 

293
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,820
questions we're going to go ahead and skip ahead of it.

294
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,602
We know how to rotate something like 3 comma 2 so I'm not 

295
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:48,580
even going to give you time to do that and properly grade it.

296
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,200
Stal, stal, words, words.

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,107
You know they tell me that it's working and yet it's very slow for me to progress 

298
00:17:57,107 --> 00:18:01,165
forward so you know if I'm not going to have a stern word with them you guys can 

299
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:05,272
go at them on twitter too under the same place that we ask questions and just say 

300
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:09,280
hey Kamineter can't you make the live questions work a little bit better for us?

301
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,160
Okay I think we're finally there.

302
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,220
Everybody ready?

303
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,520
Aha wonderful.

304
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,060
Very simple question.

305
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,133
I want you to take the number i and I want you to multiply it by 3 plus 2i 

306
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:26,046
and even though I haven't really talked about the rules for multiplication 

307
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:30,220
what I can say is pretend like it operates just like it does for normal numbers.

308
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,284
You've got things like the distributive property where you can distribute this 

309
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:38,700
throughout and then the defining feature of i is this idea that i squared is negative 1.

310
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,040
That's the only special thing you need to know about that.

311
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,777
Other than that just treat it like it's a normal 

312
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,420
number okay and then proceed forward with the product.

313
