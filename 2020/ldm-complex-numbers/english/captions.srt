00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Today we are going to talk about one of my absolute all-time favorite pieces of math.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,977
It's incredibly fundamental to engineering, to mathematics itself, 

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:12,080
to quantum mechanics, but it's something that has a terrible, terrible name.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,080
We call them complex numbers.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,043
And worse than that, the things that bring about 

6
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,120
complex numbers we call imaginary numbers.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,217
And before we get into any of it, what I want to do is start with kind of a poll, 

8
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:28,680
just to poll the audience on seeing what you guys can consider to be, well, real.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,880
What do you consider to exist when it comes to numbers?

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
So we've already been doing a couple polls in the warm-up animations, 

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,167
but as a serious poll of sorts, one that's actually going to help me see where 

12
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,753
you're coming from before we begin the lesson here, 

13
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,040
I just want to ask you a very simple question.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,700
Okay, so let's go ahead and pull it up here.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,460
Pull it on up.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,280
And, oh, for whatever reason it seems like we're having trouble polling this one up.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,020
Okay, there we go.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,300
Took a little delay there.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,569
Among the values 2, square root of 2, square root of negative 1, and infinity, 

20
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,105
which would you personally consider to really exist, 

21
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:12,640
whatever really existing means to you?

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,060
So in theory, if you guys go to 3b1b.co slash live, you should be able to answer this, 

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,560
and then the statistics based on your answers are going to start populating the screen.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,860
We won't know what those answers refer to.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,286
At the moment, all we know is that, you know, someone who has a lead, 

26
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:31,744
another one that's pretty close behind it, and as your answers come in and 

27
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:35,340
as the servers kind of digest them, we'll start to see some of the stats here.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,783
If you go to that page, by the way, 3b1b.co slash live, which redirects to itempool.com, 

29
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:45,045
what you're going to find is at the very top, you can ask a question on Twitter, 

30
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:49,729
and all that's going to do is basically open up a tweet that's going to have the hashtag 

31
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,360
in it, lockdown math, and that's the way that we're going to be doing questions to this.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,169
Instead of a live chat, anytime you have a question or a comment that you want to, 

33
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,520
you know, insert into the lesson and let that be part of the discussion, 

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,780
it's going to be pulled up here, and it looks like we already have one.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,023
This is from Yash Dave, who asks, if you could rename the complex numbers and the 

36
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,875
so-called imaginary numbers to something more intuitive, 

37
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:16,329
to a name that conveyed the fact that they have numerous applications in the real world, 

38
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,580
what would you name them?

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,120
I couldn't be happier that you asked, Yash.

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,425
So I have one friend who seems very passionate about 

41
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,280
the fact that we should call them sneaky numbers.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,322
Personally, I'm very fond of trying to connote spinning and rotation, 

43
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,682
and this is one of the things we'll talk about in today's lesson, 

44
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:35,703
is the fact that what we call complex numbers, what we call imaginary numbers, 

45
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:39,571
some of the main uses that they have come from very elegant descriptions of 

46
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:44,000
how to rotate stuff, and I hope you'll kind of see what I mean as we proceed with that.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,342
So on our poll, asking you guys which numbers you consider to really exist, 

48
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:52,288
which is of course a subjective question, there's no right or wrong answer here, 

49
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,016
I am genuinely curious, actually, how this breaks down, 

50
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,940
because it's not at all a strong consensus in one direction.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,033
It seems like we've got three top contenders, and then three that are 

52
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:07,600
falling pretty evenly behind that, so let's go ahead and take a look.

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,140
What do you consider to really exist when it comes to numbers?

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,125
Now, I can imagine which ones might be the top two, 

55
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,805
but I'm very curious about the fact that there's three all kind of coinciding with each 

56
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:25,379
other there, and it looks like I'm getting a little bit of a delay before the reveal, 

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,720
so there's kind of this nice dramatic pause.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,892
I'll tell you, for me personally, I feel like it's very silly to 

59
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,260
answer anything that's either that's not all of them or none of them.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,706
I can maybe understand if someone wants to treat infinity as something different, 

61
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:43,802
because it's ill-defined. There's lots of different things that that might mean, 

62
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:48,354
but insofar as numbers exist at all, if you consider what a number is to be a real thing, 

63
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,298
then it would... oh man, I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one. 

64
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,889
We had fixed it by live stream too, but I guess there's going to be an 

65
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,620
oscillation between when it works and when it doesn't.

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,234
So, for me, I think that the question is, well, man, 

67
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,780
I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one.

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,374
t has a kind of reality in our minds, and things like the square root of two, 

69
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,560
which you can't express as a fraction, or things like the 

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,480
square root of negative one that don't show u

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,627
But for me personally, basically, anytime that you have a numerical 

72
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,100
construct that's helpful in the real world, you know, I consider that real.

73
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,728
What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you the sense in 

74
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,320
which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, an

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,705
d from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality. 

76
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:25,678
I won't assume that you know what they are yet, it's meant to be a basic primer, 

77
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:28,467
but let's just dive right in, okay? The end, by the way, the very end here, 

78
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,780
I want to talk about two different trigonometric functions, and

79
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,555
And things like the square root of 2, which you can't express as a fraction, 

80
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:39,874
or things like the square root of negative 1 that don't show up among real normal 

81
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:43,613
numbers, you know, even if they might seem a little bit different, oh, 

82
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,720
this is such a shame.

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,712
ing that we're going to build to, two identities from trigonometry, 

84
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:53,233
and I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry 

85
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,402
is not going to be the best way to lure some people into understanding, 

86
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:59,880
oh yeah, complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really going to love th

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,880
em. But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact tha

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,808
What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you the sense 

89
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:14,742
in which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, 

90
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:18,400
and from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality.

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,533
I won't assume that you know what they are yet, 

92
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:25,580
it's meant to be a basic primer, but let's just dive right in.

93
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,032
ou can have facts that are pretty hard to remember. 

94
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:31,428
I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, 

95
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:35,296
that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know, 

96
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,900
it's this kind of long thing in te

97
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,592
And I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry 

98
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:44,330
is not going to be the best way to lure some people into understanding, oh yeah, 

99
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,700
complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really going to love them.

100
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,870
But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact that has 

101
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,281
nothing to do with complex numbers or the square root of negative one, 

102
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,740
it's just trigonometry, it's everything we were talking about last time.

103
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,460
And you can have facts that are pretty hard to remember.

104
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,746
I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, 

105
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:05,349
that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know, 

106
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,080
it's this kind of long thing in terms of cosines and sines of the original two angles.

107
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,107
y who's going into serious math, they'll tell you that complex numbers are as 

108
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:13,513
real a part of their work and their life as real numbers are. 

109
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:16,696
But the starting point looks very strange, okay? When you start introducing this, 

110
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:17,240
the very first

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,678
thing you do is to say, assume that there's some number i so that 

112
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:24,169
i squared is equal to negative 1. And I think to a lot of students 

113
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,660
there's maybe one of two possible reactions that you can have here.

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,440
It's something that's very error-prone if you're just trying to memorize it as it is.

115
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,743
However, if you come at it with complex numbers, this is not only much less error-prone, 

116
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:43,600
it has a very beautiful meaning and it just falls right out.

117
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,389
So even if you don't necessarily believe in the reality of the square root of negative 

118
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,134
one, you at the very least have to admit that it's interesting that it can make other 

119
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:54,880
pieces of math useful, that other pieces of math a little bit more understandable too.

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,097
d says, oh no no it exists, we've defined it so that that's the case. 

121
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:08,380
I think the other reaction someone can have is, hang on a second, you can do that?

122
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,474
If you talk to anybody who's in engineering, anybody who's going into serious math, 

123
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,685
they'll tell you that complex numbers are as real a part of 

124
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,380
their work and their life as real numbers are.

125
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,860
But the starting point looks very strange, okay?

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,607
do when you start talking about complex numbers is to say, 

127
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:27,434
there's not just such a number i, but we're going to give it a home. 

128
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:33,381
Instead of the real number line, which you know all of these numbers we know when we 

129
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,320
square them, you can't get a negative, wha

130
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,964
t we do is say i lives in a different dimension. i lives perpendicularly, 

131
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:41,860
there's one above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negati

132
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,431
ve 2i, you scale it however you want. Essentially it's proposing that 

133
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,697
numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very specific home, 

134
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:52,320
one unit perpendicular, uh, perpendicularly above the real number line.

135
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,706
Any time I square a number, even if it's negative, 

136
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,148
if I take negative five for example and I square it, 

137
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:56,780
well a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25.

138
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,680
Any number that you square, if it's positive, well that just stays positive.

139
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,280
So it seems like no matter what, when I'm squaring numbers I always get a positive number.

140
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm never going to get anything negative.

141
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,740
and then you move in that perpendicular direction into the extension of our number s

142
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,177
ystem, which again, you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here 

143
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:30,460
that you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers

144
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,000
I think the other reaction someone can have is, hang on a second, you can do that?

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,805
When you have a problem that you can't solve you can just say, 

146
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,640
oh I've defined things so that we now magically have a solution.

147
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,593
Okay, next time I'm having trouble with my homework and I don't know what the answer 

148
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:52,640
to x is, I will be like, let x be the value defined to be the answer to this question.

149
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,460
So if you're uncomfortable with this, you're definitely not alone.

150
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,640
In fact, Rene Descartes coined the term imaginary for these numbers as a derogatory.

151
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,753
It was meant to make fun of the fact that obviously there 

152
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,940
is no such answer and it shouldn't be taken as serious math.

153
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,642
And then we stuck with that as a convention and we still call them imaginary numbers, 

154
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:05,460
which is genuinely absurd.

155
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,458
like there's a, there's a back and forth between answers f and d, 

156
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:18,092
so f is all of them, saying that all of these should be considered real. 

157
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:22,000
And interesting, d is the one that says you

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,641
The second weird thing that you do when you start talking about complex numbers 

159
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,160
is to say, there's not just a number i, but we're going to give it a home.

160
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,330
Instead of the real number line, which you know, 

161
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:35,799
all of these numbers we know when we square them, you can't get a negative, 

162
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,140
what we do is say i lives in a different dimension.

163
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,720
i lives perpendicularly.

164
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,800
There's one above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negative 2i.

165
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,420
You scale it however you want.

166
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,650
Essentially it's proposing that numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very 

167
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,880
specific home, one unit perpendicular perpendicularly above the real number line.

168
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,912
And okay, if we want to extend our number system, I get it, 

169
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:04,360
maybe it's useful to put some kind of number up there, but why i, right?

170
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,892
Why not say infinity is the number that sits one unit above zero, 

171
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,354
or one divided by zero, or any other problem that you couldn't 

172
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:08,980
solve before and you make up an answer to, why should that live there?

173
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,360
What on earth does the idea of a point one unit above the real number 

174
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,740
line in a separate dimension have to do with squaring to negative one?

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,660
So I hope to answer this for you.

176
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,974
At the very beginning, let's just talk about how if you're adding numbers that 

177
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:19,499
are two-dimensional like this, the rules are pretty straightforward and it operates 

178
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:22,940
essentially the same as vectors for any of you who might be familiar with vectors.

179
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,829
So I guess I can pull it up on the, just on the piece of paper, 

180
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,871
and you can follow along at home, see what the addition might be. 

181
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:39,060
It turns out to be relatively straightforward. If you're moving four units to the

182
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,976
And then I'm going to take a second number and it's helpful to draw them as vectors, 

183
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,070
kind of an arrow from the number zero, and this one is going 

184
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,340
to end up at negative two plus two i.

185
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,424
So what I'm saying is you take the real number negative two and then you move in 

186
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:51,089
that perpendicular direction into the extension of our number system, 

187
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,136
which again you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here that 

188
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:57,334
you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers extend 

189
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:58,020
in this direction.

190
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,801
can get you something like it. But the rules end up being very different 

191
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,290
from that in the number system. You can't really do algebra. 

192
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,120
You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, 

193
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,560
then one of them h

194
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,828
as to be zero. But complex numbers are going to 

195
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,080
end up behaving much like the real numbers, s

196
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,829
Now assuming that our question system has not broken down, 

197
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,905
I should be able to do this as a proper poll and let me go ahead, 

198
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:13,774
I guess we can first check the previous poll, okay things seem to be working so we 

199
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:17,176
can take a little step back in the lesson so I'm just genuinely curious, 

200
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,460
I want to know how you guys answered on this one.

201
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,011
It looks like there's a there's a back and forth between answers f and d, 

202
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:26,466
so f is all of them saying that all of these should be considered real, 

203
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:30,594
and interesting d is the one that says you should consider two square root of two and 

204
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:34,769
negative one but not infinity, so there's a good contingent of you out there who would 

205
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,944
just reject infinity as being considered real but are very comfortable with the square 

206
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:42,544
root of negative one, that's awesome, and then after that it looks like c, 

207
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:45,615
people who reject the square root of negative one, fascinating, 

208
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:49,551
I actually would have thought that none of them would have come higher than that, 

209
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:53,774
none of them is much lower at a, okay so it looks like we've got a cohort of people who 

210
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:57,757
are comfortable with negative one, a large cohort are uncomfortable with infinity, 

211
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,349
that's a topic for another day, don't worry about it, 

212
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:04,428
and then a number of people who are kind of in that middle ground of maybe not being 

213
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:07,548
super comfortable with the idea that negative one might be real, 

214
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:10,380
let's see if we can convince you of the difference of that.

215
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,423
So what we've done here is we've taken three, two and then we convert it to negative two, 

216
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:22,666
three. Something which maybe in our original system you know looks 

217
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,640
like this negative two and then three.

218
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,507
Before I've taught you how to add them, make a guess at how it might work, 

219
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:32,035
and I hope that it feels pretty straightforward, 

220
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,541
addition is actually the least interesting part of this, but it is, 

221
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:39,152
it's a good thing to know when you're learning about complex numbers, 

222
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:43,020
it's definitely one of those operations that you are going to need to know.

223
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,734
Unfortunately, and you can tell by the fact that I'm stalling and what I'm saying here, 

224
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:55,075
it looks like the question is still not loading completely correctly, 

225
00:12:55,075 --> 00:13:00,416
so I'm going to have a stern word with Cam and Ider behind the scenes 

226
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:05,756
who have otherwise built such a beautiful, beautiful interface that's 

227
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:10,640
helpful for this kind of back and forth between you guys and me.

228
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,722
nice gut check here is to say what happens when we do that twice what 

229
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:18,570
if we do that same very mechanistic operation again twice and I'm 

230
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,711
going to go and take this I swap the two coordinates we get a negative 

231
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:26,560
b but then that first one becomes negative. So that was another 90

232
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,588
degree rotation. Well what's happened here is we've just made both of the coordinates 

233
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:32,300
negative and that's reassuring because if I take some point sitting at a b an

234
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,400
It turns out to be relatively straightforward.

235
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,423
h is just taking both of the coordinates and making them negative negative a 

236
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:45,290
negative b okay so that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree 

237
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,731
rotation actually behaves like you would expect it to. Now why am I asking you this? 

238
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:53,860
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again so I

239
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,869
'm going to have you do your very first complex product. 

240
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:01,668
Oh look a lot of people did submit answers very good. 

241
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:05,960
Great let's let's grade the complex addition actually let's l

242
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,404
et's see if it is as straightforward a process as I was hoping it was and see 

243
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:18,849
how much explanation is demanded. Okay so it looks like a majority of you did 

244
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:24,136
get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i. Very good very good. 

245
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:30,581
52 of you answered simply 2 which would have been the real part of the answer 

246
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:36,860
so maybe just the fact that there's some vertical component and you need to 

247
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,100
still add those

248
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,060
vertical components or maybe those of you who answer 2 reject the reality of 

249
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,020
imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical component.

250
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:52,820
Addition doesn't really have anything complicated going on, which is great.

251
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,880
s just making that's just swapping up whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus

252
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,900
4 so that's completely understandable. We've got 2 plus 3 which is maybe just dropping

253
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Well where everything becomes interesting is when 

254
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,900
you try to multiply these numbers together.

255
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,713
So with vectors, there's not really any notion of multiplying 

256
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:01,580
them to get two vectors back, at least when we're in the 2d plane.

257
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,665
that we ask questions and just say hey kamineter can't you make the live questions 

258
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:07,788
work a little bit better for us? Okay I think we're finally there. Everybody ready? 

259
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,540
Aha! Wonderful! Very simple question I want you to take the number i and I

260
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:17,660
want you to multiply it by 3 plus 2i and even though I haven't really talked about

261
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,754
You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, 

262
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:26,231
then one of them has to be zero, but complex numbers are going to end up behaving 

263
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:29,834
much like the real numbers, so rules from algebra can carry over, 

264
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:33,983
but to understand what that rotation rule is, oh no I'm giving things away, 

265
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:38,132
what that multiplication rule is, I just want to ask you a simple question, 

266
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:41,462
which is basically suppose I have the point three two, okay, 

267
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:44,956
we're not even going to think of it as a complex number per se, 

268
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:49,542
if I just have some sort of coordinate grid and I go to the point with x coordinate 

269
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,200
three and y coordinate two, what is the 90 degree rotation of this?

270
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,682
If I rotate it 90 degrees and let's say counterclockwise, 

271
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:58,380
counter, counter, jeez, writing is difficult, counterclockwise.

272
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,529
Okay, now what's lovely about this is we can basically 

273
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:00,980
just turn our paper to figure it out.

274
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,734
ons as you do it rather than sitting in passively watching this is genuinely 

275
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:08,196
delightful to me. Okay this is this isn't necessarily a question I was 

276
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:11,950
expecting to divide the audience necessarily so unsurprisingly it looks like 

277
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,510
we have a very strong majority in one direction hopefully in the correct 

278
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,460
direction but if not that would that would heavily inform where the lesson should

279
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,704
So what we've done here is we've taken three two and then we convert it to 

280
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,992
negative two three, something which maybe in our original system, you know, 

281
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:29,800
looks like this, negative two and then three, that's going to be the 90 degree rotation.

282
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,405
it looks like the majority of you answered negative two plus three i 

283
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:38,671
which is absolutely correct absolutely correct so there's two ways to 

284
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:43,120
think about this okay one of them is to walk forward with the algebra and

285
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,315
just do it a little bit mechanistically okay so if we pull ourselves up our sheet if 

286
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:49,473
we take i times three plus two i three plus two i it just distributes i times three 

287
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:52,706
is going to be three i i times two i is going to be two times i squared by definition 

288
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:55,940
i squared is negative one which means that our final answer is going to look like nega

289
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,120
That's a 90 degree rotation.

290
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,980
like I said it looks like a majority of you correctly did that product now it's one 

291
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,875
thing to just walk through it mechanistically it's another to step back and say what 

292
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,599
just happened geometrically right because what we just talked through was the fa

293
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,668
ct that if you want to rotate numbers 90 degrees the rule 

294
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:05,900
is to swap the two coordinates and then multiply that first

295
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,271
one by negative two well look at what's happened here we've got three 

296
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:16,566
and two those coordinates have been swapped two is now the real part 

297
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:21,938
three is the imaginary part but that two got multiplied by a negative 

298
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:27,540
one because i has this defining feature of squaring to become negative on

299
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,961
e so that should give you some indication that okay multiplying 

300
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,360
by i has this action of rotating things by 90 degrees maybe tha

301
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,075
Well what's happened here is we've just made both of the coordinates negative 

302
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:37,743
and that's reassuring because if I take some point sitting at a b and then I 

303
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:41,030
rotate it 90 degrees, so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation, 

304
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,697
and then another 90 degrees that's the same as a 180 degree roto- oh no I've 

305
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,460
done that wrong.

306
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,627
have a number that behaves this way it gives you a computational mechanism for all 

307
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:53,894
of the other types of rotations that you might want to do that might not necessarily 

308
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:58,011
be 90 degrees and to show you why this works i'm going to go ahead and pull up an 

309
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:02,380
animation so let's say we have any number z and in this case z is going to be let's see

310
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,736
where do i have it z is going to be at two uh plus i great and let's 

311
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,093
say i want to understand what is multiplying by z due to every other 

312
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,280
possible complex number well we can go one by one the very first

313
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,183
So that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree 

314
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:18,060
rotation actually behaves like you would expect it to.

315
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,000
ask what is z times one where does it take the number one well z times one is going to be

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,375
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again, 

317
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,040
so I'm going to have you do your very first complex product.

318
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,475
tch that arrow up to the point where z is great a kind of 

319
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,060
trivial fact even though it's trivial i'm actually going to take

320
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,900
a moment to write that down just so that we can oh no no no that's for that's for 

321
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,621
later that is randy don't you guys worry about him he'll be coming in in just a 

322
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:42,698
moment so i just want to write down three crucial facts that are getting an influence 

323
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:47,420
rotation three facts i'll call it three facts about multiplication the first two

324
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,337
Okay so it looks like a majority of you did get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i, 

325
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:49,800
very good, very good.

326
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,964
52 of you answered simply 2 which would have been the real part of the answer so 

327
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:58,025
maybe just the fact that there's some vertical component and you need to still 

328
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:02,035
add those vertical components or maybe those of you who answered 2 reject the 

329
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:06,560
reality of imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical component.

330
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,419
hatever the 90 degree rotation point for z itself is okay so 

331
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,232
two down infinitely many to go okay we know what it does to 

332
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:15,280
one we know what it does to i let's see if we can understand what

333
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,931
z does to any other possible number well it turns out those two is really 

334
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:22,632
all we need to work with if we have the distributive property so the third 

335
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:26,135
fact that's going to look kind of innocuous is let's say i take this z 

336
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:29,540
and i multiply it by c plus d times i where c and d are just any two 

337
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,340
numbers okay well this is going to distribute so z times c i'm actually going

338
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,430
to write that a little differently i'm going to write it as c times z plus z times 

339
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,619
di which again i'm going to write in kind of a funny order and write that as d times 

340
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:45,660
z i now the idea here is well we know where z is we also know where z times i is s

341
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,994
o if we're just scaling them up by some other constants that 

342
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,460
completely constrains where we need to go so let me go ahead and wr

343
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,745
ite this down with an example okay let's say that we go back here and i want to know 

344
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:56,980
what multiplying by z does to anything i want to tell i want to convince you that it

345
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Stal, stal, words, words.

346
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,062
n a way that keeps these lines parallel it keeps them evenly spaced keeps them 

347
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:07,530
perpendicular to each other it applies this very constrained rule to the whole plane 

348
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,805
and really just think through any one particular point for this let's say that we 

349
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:18,273
have two times negative i okay so you move two units in the positive right direction 

350
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:23,548
and then negative one unit in the vertical direction well after the product where 

351
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:28,823
that's going to land has to be two times wherever z lands plus negative one times 

352
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:29,660
wherever i la

353
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,895
nds okay and we see that right it's two times this 

354
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:38,380
yellow vector and it'll be negative one times the gree

355
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,080
n vector so here even before you actually work out the product we could just read off

356
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,180
Aha wonderful.

357
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,180
Very simple question.

358
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,314
which says what is two plus i times two minus i and if you have notes 

359
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:50,669
right now if you have a pencil and paper which i encourage you to always 

360
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:55,951
come to class with i want you to try working it out do the first inside 

361
00:20:55,951 --> 00:21:01,600
outside last distribution property just to see mechanistically what number en

362
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,060
ds up popping out from this and then we'll try to see how that squares with the 

363
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,315
geometric intuition so while you're doing that while you're working that out 

364
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:17,980
hopefully on pencil and paper it looks like we've got a question from the audience 

365
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,440
which is is i the same as i and j the vectors in physics great question actually

366
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,700
That's the only special thing you need to know about that.

367
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,052
Other than that just treat it like it's a normal 

368
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:24,440
number okay and then proceed forward with the product.

369
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,593
Wonderful okay so it looks like we've got quite a 

370
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:31,000
few of you coming in to answer which is always lovely.

371
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,941
Super exciting for me by the way just how many people are enthusiastic 

372
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:38,882
about coming and like getting back to the fundamentals of math in this 

373
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:43,100
lockdown and just you know we're gonna sit back for an hour and we're gonna 

374
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,041
learn about complex numbers and we're actually gonna participate we're 

375
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:51,760
actually gonna answer questions as you do rather than sitting and passively watching.

376
00:21:51,760 --> 01:22:10,370
This is genuinely delightful to me.
