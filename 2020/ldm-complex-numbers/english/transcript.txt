Today we are going to talk about one of my absolute all-time favorite pieces of math. 
It's incredibly fundamental to engineering, to mathematics itself, to quantum mechanics, but it's something that has a terrible, terrible name. 
We call them complex numbers. 
And worse than that, the things that bring about complex numbers we call imaginary numbers. 
And before we get into any of it, what I want to do is start with kind of a poll, just to poll the audience on seeing what you guys can consider to be, well, real. 
What do you exist when it comes to numbers? 
So we've already been doing a couple polls in the warm-up animations, but as a serious poll of sorts, one that's actually going to help me see where you're coming from before we begin the lesson here, I just want to ask you a very simple question. 
Okay, so let's go ahead and pull it up here. 
Pull it on up. 
And, oh, for whatever reason it seems like we're having trouble polling this one up. 
Okay, there we go. 
Took a little delay there. 
Among the values 2, square root of 2, square root of negative 1, and infinity, which would you personally consider to really exist, whatever really existing means to you? 
So in theory, if you guys go to 3b1b.co slash live, you should be able to answer this, and then the statistics based on your answers are going to start populating the screen. 
We won't know what those answers refer to. 
At the moment, all we know is that, you know, someone who has a lead, another one that's pretty close behind it, and as your answers come in and as the servers kind of digest them, we'll start to see some of the stats here. 
If you go to that page, by the way, 3b1b.co slash live, which redirects to itempool.com, what you're going to find is at the very top, you can ask a question on Twitter, and all that's going to do is basically open up a tweet that's going to have the hashtag in it, lockdown math, and that's the way that we're going to be doing questions to this. 
Instead of a live chat, anytime you have a question or a comment that you want to, you know, insert into the lesson and let that be part of the discussion, it's going to be pulled up here, and it looks like we already have one. 
This is from Yash Dave, who asks, if you could rename the complex numbers and the so-called imaginary numbers to something more intuitive, to a name that conveyed the fact that they have numerous applications in the real world, what would you name them? 
I couldn't be happier that you asked, Yash. 
So I have one friend who seems very passionate about the fact that we should call them sneaky numbers. 
Personally, I'm very fond of trying to connote spinning and rotation, and this is one of the things we'll talk about in today's lesson, is the fact that what we call complex numbers, what we call imaginary numbers, some of the main uses that they have come from very elegant descriptions of how to rotate stuff, and I hope you'll kind of see what I mean as we proceed with that. 
So on our poll, asking you guys which numbers you consider to really exist, which is of course a subjective question, there's no right or wrong answer here, I am genuinely curious, actually, how this breaks down, because it's not at all a strong consensus in one direction. 
It seems like we've got three top contenders, and then three that are falling pretty evenly behind that, so let's go ahead and take a look. 
What do you consider to really exist when it comes to numbers? 
Now, I can imagine which ones might be the top two, but I'm very curious about the fact that there's three all kind of coinciding with each other there, and it looks like I'm getting a little bit of a delay before the reveal, so there's kind of this nice dramatic pause. 
I'll tell you, for me personally, I feel like it's very silly to answer anything that's either that's not all of them or none of them. 
I can maybe understand if someone wants to treat infinity as something different because it's ill-defined, there's lots of different things that that might mean, but insofar as numbers exist at all, if you have a number of numbers, you can't really answer. 
So, for me, I think that the question is, well, man, I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one. 
We had fixed it by live stream, too, but I guess there's going to be an oscillation between when it works and when it doesn't. 
But for me personally, basically, anytime that you have a numerical construct that's helpful in the real world, you know, I consider that real. 
I would say that if it's something that's actually useful in an application, then it is as real as words are, right? 
You're never going to run into an abstract word like happiness out there, but it has a kind of reality in our minds. 
And things like the square root of 2, which you can't express as a fraction, or things like the square root of negative 1 that don't show up among real normal numbers, you know, even if they might seem a little bit different, oh, this is such a shame. 
I'm genuinely curious to see what your answers are, but it's not showing up for me, which I suppose means we'll have to move on with the lesson, but this will presumably begin working by the end and we can maybe pull things up again. 
So let me go ahead and take that away. 
What I'd like to do for you today, basically, is show you the sense in which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers are useful, and from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality. 
I won't assume that you know what they are yet, it's meant to be a basic primer, but let's just dive right in. 
Okay, the end, by the way, the very end here, I want to talk about two different trigonometric functions, and this is kind of the thing that we're going to build to, two identities from trigonometry. 
And I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry is not going to be the best way to lure some people into understanding, oh yeah, complex numbers, they're really useful, you're really going to love them. 
But I do think it's interesting that you can have a fact that has nothing to do with complex numbers or the square root of negative one, it's just trigonometry, it's everything we were talking about last time. 
And you can have facts that are pretty hard to remember. 
I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition formulas, that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know, it's this kind of long thing in terms of cosines and sines of the original two angles. 
There's this minus sign that would always trip people up. 
If you do the same for the sine, it looks similar, but there's a plus sign, and instead of having cos cos, you have cosine. 
It's something that's very error-prone if you're just trying to memorize it as it is. 
However, if you come at it with complex numbers, this is not only much less error-prone, it has a very beautiful meaning and it just falls right out. 
So even if you don't necessarily believe in the reality of the square root of negative one, you at the very least have to admit that it's interesting that it can make other pieces of math useful, that other pieces of math a little bit more understandable too. 
And trigonometry is just the tip of the iceberg. 
If you talk to anybody who's in engineering, anybody who's going into serious math, they'll tell you that complex numbers are as real a part of their work and their life as real numbers are. 
But the starting point looks very strange, okay? 
When you start introducing this, the very first thing you do is to say, assume that there's some number i so that i squared is equal to negative one. 
And I think to a lot of students there's maybe one of two possible reactions that you can have here. 
One is, no there isn't, right? 
Any time I square a number, even if it's negative, if I take negative five for example and I square it, well a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25. 
Any number that you square, if it's positive, well that just stays positive. 
So it seems like no matter what, when I'm squaring numbers I always get a positive number. 
I'm never going to get anything negative. 
So this does not exist, no such number. 
However, if a mathematician comes and says, oh no it exists, we've defined it so that that's the case. 
I think the other reaction someone can have is, hang on a second, you can do that? 
When you have a problem that you can't solve you can just say, oh I've defined things so that we now magically have a solution. 
Okay, next time I'm having trouble with my homework and I don't know what the answer to x is, I will be like, let x be the value defined to be the answer to this question. 
So if you're uncomfortable with this, you're definitely not alone. 
In fact, Rene Descartes coined the term imaginary for these numbers as a derogatory. 
It was meant to make fun of the fact that obviously there is no such answer and it shouldn't be taken as serious math. 
And then we stuck with that as a convention and we still call them imaginary numbers, which is genuinely absurd. 
But that's not the only weird assumption that we make. 
The second weird thing that you do when you start talking about complex numbers is to say, there's not just a number i, but we're going to give it a home. 
Instead of the real number line, which you know, all of these numbers we know when we square them, you can't get a negative, what we do is say i lives in a different dimension. 
i lives perpendicularly. 
There's one above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negative 2i. 
You scale it however you want. 
Essentially it's proposing that numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very specific home, one unit perpendicular perpendicularly above the real number line. 
And okay, if we want to extend our number system, I get it, maybe it's useful to put some kind of number up there, but why i, right? 
Why not say infinity is the number that sits one unit above zero, or one divided by zero, or any other problem that you couldn't solve before and you make up an answer to, why should that live there? 
What on earth does the idea of a point one unit above the real number line in a separate dimension have to do with squaring to negative one? 
So I hope to answer this for you. 
At the very beginning, let's just talk about how if you're adding numbers that are two-dimensional like this, the rules are pretty straightforward and it operates essentially the same as vectors for any of you who might be familiar with vectors. 
So let's say hypothetically I have a number, oh I don't know, let me draw one here that's going to be four plus i, okay? 
And then I'm going to take a second number and it's helpful to draw them as vectors, kind of an arrow from the number zero, and this one is going to end up at negative two plus two i. 
So what I'm saying is you take the real number negative two and then you move in that perpendicular direction into the extension of our number system, which again you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here that you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers extend in this direction. 
If you take that on faith and you follow, hopefully the fact that it becomes useful helps to justify why we're doing any of this. 
So my question for you is simply what happens when we add these two numbers? 
Now assuming that our question system has not broken down, I should be able to do this as a proper poll and let me go ahead, I guess we can first check the previous poll, okay things seem to be working so we can take a little step back in the lesson so I'm just genuinely curious, I want to know how you guys answered on this one. 
It looks like there's a there's a back and forth between answers f and d, so f is all of them saying that all of these should be considered real, and interesting d is the one that says you should consider two square root of two and negative one but not infinity, so there's a good contingent of you out there who would just reject infinity as being considered real but are very comfortable with the square root of negative one, that's awesome, and then after that it looks like c, people who reject the square root of negative one, fascinating, I actually would have thought that none of them would have come higher than that, none of them is much lower at a, okay so it looks like we've got a cohort of people who are comfortable with negative one, a large cohort are uncomfortable with infinity, that's a topic for another day, don't worry about it, and then a number of people who are kind of in that middle ground of maybe not being super comfortable with the idea that negative one might be real, let's see if we can convince you of the difference of that. 
So for our first much more mathematical question, as kind of a warm-up, I just want to ask you to add these two. 
Before I've taught you how to add them, make a guess at how it might work, and I hope that it feels pretty straightforward, addition is actually the least interesting part of this, but it is, it's a good thing to know when you're learning about complex numbers, it's definitely one of those operations that you are going to need to know. 
Unfortunately, and you can tell by the fact that I'm stalling and what I'm saying here, it looks like the question is still not loading completely correctly, so I'm going to have a stern word with Cam and Ider behind the scenes who have otherwise built such a beautiful, beautiful interface that's helpful for this kind of back and forth between you guys and me. 
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna have a stern word with them behind the scenes, but in the meantime, let's go ahead and move forward with the lesson here. 
So I guess I can pull it up on the, just on the piece of paper, and you can follow along at home, see what the addition might be. 
It turns out to be relatively straightforward. 
If you're moving four units to the right and then one unit up, and you want to add the idea of moving two units to the left and then two units up, well you just do each of those one at a time. 
I'll go ahead and pull out black here. 
The real part is going to be those four to the right, then minus two to the left, okay, straightforward enough, and then the imaginary part is going to be this one unit up and then these two units up, one plus two, times i, so is that one i plus two i, and then when you work that out four minus two is two, one plus two is three. 
A nice simple introduction here. 
Addition doesn't really have anything complicated going on, which is great. 
That means that it's one fewer thing for us to worry about. 
What is so complex about complex numbers after all? 
Well where everything becomes interesting is when you try to multiply these numbers together. 
So with vectors, there's not really any notion of multiplying them to get two vectors back, at least when we're in the 2d plane. 
You have some notions like cross products and dot products that in three dimensions can get you something like it, but the rules end up being very different from that in the number system. 
You can't really do algebra. 
You can't do things like assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, then one of them has to be zero, but complex numbers are going to end up behaving much like the real numbers, so rules from algebra can carry over, but to understand what that rotation rule is, oh no I'm giving things away, what that multiplication rule is, I just want to ask you a simple question, which is basically suppose I have the point three two, okay, we're not even going to think of it as a complex number per se, if I just have some sort of coordinate grid and I go to the point with x coordinate three and y coordinate two, what is the 90 degree rotation of this? 
If I rotate it 90 degrees and let's say counterclockwise, counter, counter, jeez, writing is difficult, counterclockwise. 
Okay, now what's lovely about this is we can basically just turn our paper to figure it out. 
We say okay if it started at three two and then I rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, I can just read that off now as being negative two in the x direction and then three in the y direction, if I had rotated the whole plane like that. 
So what we've done here is we've taken three two and then we convert it to negative two three, something which maybe in our original system, you know, looks like this, negative two and then three, that's going to be the 90 degree rotation. 
And what's nice here is that that rule is very simple and it applies to any pair that we might have. 
If I took a pair of numbers a comma b, okay, and then I said where is that going to rotate to if I rotate it 90 degrees, it's going to end up by swapping the coordinates b a and then making that first one negative. 
That's a 90 degree rotation. 
And a nice gut check here is to say what happens when we do that twice? 
What if we do that same very mechanistic operation again twice? 
And I'm going to go and take this, I swap the two coordinates, we get a negative b, but then that first one becomes negative. 
So that was another 90 degree rotation. 
Well what's happened here is we've just made both of the coordinates negative and that's reassuring because if I take some point sitting at a b and then I rotate it 90 degrees, so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation, and then another 90 degrees that's the same as a 180 degree roto- oh no I've done that wrong. 
That will be the same as a 180 degree rotation which should look like this, ignore the other vector that I drew, which is just taking both of the coordinates and making them negative. 
Negative a negative b, okay. 
So that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree rotation actually behaves like you would expect it to. 
Now why am I asking you this? 
Well I'm being told that supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again, so I'm going to have you do your very first complex product. 
Oh look a lot of people did submit answers, very good. 
Great let's grade the complex addition actually, let's see if it is as straightforward a process as I was hoping it was and see how much explanation is demanded. 
Okay so it looks like a majority of you did get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i, very good, very good. 
52 of you answered simply 2 which would have been the real part of the answer so maybe just the fact that there's some vertical component and you need to still add those vertical components or maybe those of you who answered 2 reject the reality of imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical component. 
Some of you answered negative 2 3 which I guess is just making- that's just swapping up whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus 4 so that's completely understandable. 
We've got 2 plus 3 which is maybe just dropping off the i so I think maybe a lot of like simple errors and entry and you know that happens to all of us especially on tests is sometimes you know what the right answer is but then you you forget a symbol or you swap two so that's all very good. 
Let's go ahead and try our very first product though like I said. 
So here because I already talked through one of the questions we're going to go ahead and skip ahead of it. 
We know how to rotate something like 3 comma 2 so I'm not even going to give you time to do that and properly grade it. 
Stal, stal, words, words. 
You know they tell me that it's working and yet it's very slow for me to progress forward so you know if I'm not going to have a stern word with them you guys can go at them on twitter too under the same place that we ask questions and just say hey Kamineter can't you make the live questions work a little bit better for us? 
Okay I think we're finally there. 
Everybody ready? 
Aha wonderful. 
Very simple question. 
I want you to take the number i and I want you to multiply it by 3 plus 2i and even though I haven't really talked about the rules for multiplication what I can say is pretend like it operates just like it does for normal numbers. 
You've got things like the distributive property where you can distribute this throughout and then the defining feature of i is this idea that i squared is negative 1. 
That's the only special thing you need to know about that. 
Other than that just treat it like it's a normal number okay and then proceed forward with the product. 
Wonderful okay so it looks like we've got quite a few of you coming in to answer which is always lovely. 
Super exciting for me by the way just how many people are enthusiastic about coming and like getting back to the fundamentals of math in this lockdown and just you know we're gonna sit back for an hour and we're gonna learn about complex numbers and we're actually gonna participate we're actually gonna answer questions as you do rather than sitting and passively watching. 
This is genuinely delightful to me.
