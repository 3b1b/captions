00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Today we are going to talk about one of my absolute all-time favorite pieces of math.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,680
It's incredibly fundamental to engineering, to mathematics itself, to quantum mechanics,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,480
but it's something that has a terrible, terrible name. We call them complex numbers.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,520
And worse than that, the things that bring about complex numbers we call imaginary numbers.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
And before we get into any of it, what I want to do is start with kind of a poll,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,880
just to poll the audience on seeing what you guys can consider to be, well, real. What do you

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,760
consider to exist when it comes to numbers? So we've already been doing a couple polls in the

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,880
warm-up animations, but as a serious poll of sorts, one that's actually going to help me see

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,600
where you're coming from before we begin the lesson here, I just want to ask you a very simple

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:52,640
question, okay? So let's go ahead and poll it up here. Pull it on up. And, oh, for whatever reason,

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,440
it seems like we're having trouble polling this one up. Hmm. Okay, there we go. Took a little

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,040
delay there. Among the values 2, square root of 2, square root of negative 1, and infinity,

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,400
which would you personally consider to really exist, whatever really existing means to you?

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,040
So in theory, if you guys go to 3b1b.co slash live, you should be able to answer this,

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
and then the statistics based on your answers are going to start populating the screen.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,040
We won't know what those answers refer to. At the moment, all we know is that there's someone

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,240
who has a lead, another one that's pretty close behind it, and as your answers come in and as the

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
servers kind of digest them, we'll start to see some of the stats here. If you go to that page,

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,080
by the way, 3b1b.co slash live, which redirects to itempool.com, what you're going to find is at

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,280
the very top you can ask a question on Twitter, and all that's going to do is basically open up

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,040
a tweet that's going to have the hashtag in it, lockdown math, and that's the way that we're going

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
to be doing questions to this. Instead of a live chat, anytime you have a question or a comment

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
that you want to, you know, insert into the lesson and let that be part of the discussion,

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,600
it's going to be pulled up here, and it looks like we already have one. This is from Yash

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,440
Dave, who asks if you could rename the complex numbers and the so-called imaginary numbers to

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,600
something more intuitive, to a name that conveyed the fact that they have numerous applications in

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,720
the real world, what would you name them? I couldn't be happier that you asked, Yash. So I

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,560
have one friend who seems very passionate about the fact that we should call them sneaky numbers.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,040
Personally, I'm very fond of trying to connote spinning and rotation, and this is one of the

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
things we'll talk about in today's lesson, is the fact that what we call complex numbers, what we

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,600
call imaginary numbers, some of the main uses that they have come from very elegant descriptions of

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,840
how to rotate stuff, and I hope you'll kind of see what I mean as we proceed with that.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,600
So on our poll, asking you guys which numbers you consider to really exist, which is of course a

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,920
subjective question, there's no right or wrong answer here. I am genuinely curious, actually,

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,800
how this breaks down, because it's not at all a strong consensus in one direction. It seems like

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,400
we've got three top contenders, and then three that are falling pretty evenly behind that, so

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,080
let's go ahead and take a look. What do you consider to really exist when it comes to numbers?

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
Now, I can imagine which ones might be the top two, but I'm very curious about the fact that

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,160
there's three all kind of coinciding with each other there, and it looks like I'm getting a

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,600
little bit of a delay before the reveal, so there's kind of this nice dramatic pause.

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll tell you, for me personally, I feel like it's very silly to answer anything that's either,

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,600
that's not all of them or none of them. I can maybe understand if someone wants to treat

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,360
infinity as something different, because it's ill-defined. There's lots of different things

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,120
that that might mean, but insofar as numbers exist at all, if you consider what a number is to be a

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,080
real thing, then it would... oh man, I can't believe that we're stalling out on this one. We had fixed

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,600
it by live stream too, but I guess there's going to be an oscillation between when it works and

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,400
when it doesn't. But for me personally, basically, any time that you have a numerical construct

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,320
that's helpful in the real world, you know, I consider that real. I would say that if it's

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,760
something that's actually useful in an application, then it is as real as words are, right? You're

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,160
never going to run into an abstract word like happiness out there, but it has a kind of reality

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,280
in our minds, and things like the square root of two, which you can't express as a fraction,

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
or things like the square root of negative one that don't show up among real normal numbers,

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
you know, even if they might seem a little bit different. Oh, this is such a shame. I'm genuinely

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
curious to see what your answers are, but it's not showing up for me, which I suppose means we'll

55
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,200
have to move on with the lesson, but this will presumably begin working by the end and we can

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:52,640
maybe pull things up again. So let me go ahead and take that away. What I'd like to do for you today,

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,120
basically, is show you the sense in which imaginary numbers are useful, the complex numbers

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,920
are useful, and from there maybe try to imbue them with a little more reality. I won't assume that

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,960
you know what they are yet, it's meant to be a basic primer, but let's just dive right in, okay?

60
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,600
The end, by the way, the very end here, I want to talk about two different trigonometric functions,

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,160
and this is kind of the thing that we're going to build to, two identities from trigonometry, and

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,680
I understand that maybe, oh, these complicated identities from trigonometry is not going to be

63
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
the best way to lure some people into understanding, oh yeah, complex numbers,

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
they're really useful, you're really going to love them. But I do think it's interesting that

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,480
you can have a fact that has nothing to do with complex numbers or the square root of negative 1,

66
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,320
it's just trigonometry, it's everything we were talking about last time, and you can have facts

67
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
that are pretty hard to remember. I remember when I was in school and we learned these addition

68
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,320
formulas, that if you want to know the cosine of the sum of two different angles, you know,

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,880
it's this kind of long thing in terms of cosines and sines of the original two angles,

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
there's this minus sign that would always trip people up, if you do the same for the sign,

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,080
it looks similar but there's a plus sign, and instead of having cos-cos you have cos-sin,

72
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,680
it's something that's very error-prone if you're just trying to memorize it as it is.

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,640
However, if you come at it with complex numbers, this is not only much less error-prone,

74
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,680
it has a very beautiful meaning and it just falls right out. So even if you don't necessarily believe

75
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
in the reality of the square root of negative 1, you at the very least have to admit that it's

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,880
interesting that it can make other pieces of math useful, that other pieces of math a little bit

77
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,640
more understandable too. And trigonometry is just the tip of the iceberg. If you talk to anybody

78
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,640
who's in engineering, anybody who's going into serious math, they'll tell you that complex

79
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,120
numbers are as real a part of their work and their life as real numbers are. But the starting point

80
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,680
looks very strange, okay? When you start introducing this, the very first thing you do is to say,

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,600
assume that there's some number i so that i squared is equal to negative 1. And I think to

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,720
a lot of students there's maybe one of two possible reactions that you can have here. One is, no there

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,160
isn't, right? Any time I square a number, even if it's negative, if I take negative 5 for example,

84
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,400
and I square it, well a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25. Any number that you

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,680
square, if it's positive, well that just stays positive. So it seems like no matter what, when

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
I'm squaring numbers, I always get a positive number. I'm never going to get anything negative.

87
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,960
So this does not exist, no such number. However, if a mathematician comes and says, oh no no it

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,080
exists, we've defined it so that that's the case. I think the other reaction someone can have is,

89
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
hang on a second, you can do that? When you have a problem that you can't solve, you can just say,

90
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,920
oh I've defined things so that we now magically have a solution. Okay, next time I'm having

91
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,440
trouble with my homework and I don't know what the answer to x is, I will be like, let x be the

92
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,400
value defined to be the answer to this question. So if you're uncomfortable with this, you're

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,640
definitely not alone. In fact, Rene Descartes coined the term imaginary for these numbers

94
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,120
as a derogatory. It was meant to make fun of the fact that obviously there is no such answer and

95
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,040
it shouldn't be taken as serious math. And then we stuck with that as a convention and we still

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,920
call them imaginary numbers, which is genuinely absurd. But that's not the only weird assumption

97
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,640
that we make. The second weird thing that you do when you start talking about complex numbers

98
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,440
is to say, there's not just such a number i, but we're going to give it a home. Instead of the real

99
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,000
number line, which you know all of these numbers we know when we square them, you can't get a

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,200
negative, what we do is say i lives in a different dimension. i lives perpendicularly, there's one

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,720
above and then there's one below, negative i, and you can have negative 2i, you scale it however you

102
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,080
want. Essentially it's proposing that numbers be two-dimensional and that i has a very specific home,

103
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:49,440
one unit perpendicular, uh, perpendicularly above the real number line. And, okay, if we want to extend

104
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,520
our number system, I get it, maybe it's useful to put some kind of number up there, but why i, right?

105
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Why not say infinity is the number that sits one unit above zero, or one divided by zero, or any

106
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,600
other problem that you couldn't solve before and you make up an answer to, why should that live

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,600
there? What on earth does the idea of a point one unit above the real number line in a separate

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,920
dimension have to do with squaring to negative one? So I hope to answer this for you. At the very

109
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,880
beginning, let's just talk about how if you're adding numbers that are two-dimensional like this,

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,880
the rules are pretty straightforward and it operates essentially the same as vectors, for

111
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
any of you who might be familiar with vectors. So let's say, hypothetically, I have a number,

112
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,240
oh I don't know, let me draw one here that's going to be 4 plus i, okay? And then I'm going to take a

113
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,360
second number and it's helpful to draw them as vectors, kind of an arrow from the number zero,

114
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,560
and this one is going to end up at negative 2 plus 2i. So what I'm saying is, uh, you take the real

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,040
number negative 2 and then you move in that perpendicular direction into the extension of

116
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
our number system, which again, you're kind of asking the students to take a lot on faith here

117
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,200
that you're okay to do that, that you're allowed to just pretend that the numbers extend in this

118
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,520
direction. If you take that on faith and you follow, hopefully the fact that it becomes useful

119
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,080
helps to justify why we're doing any of this. So my question for you is simply, what happens

120
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,840
when we add these two numbers? Now, assuming that our question system has not broken down,

121
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,720
I should be able to do this as a proper poll. And let me go ahead, I guess we can first check the

122
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,640
previous poll, okay things seem to be working, so we can take a little step back in the lesson,

123
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,080
so I'm just genuinely curious, I want to know how you guys answered on this one.

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,040
Um, it looks like there's a, there's a back and forth between answers f and d, so f is all of them,

125
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,520
saying that all of these should be considered real. And interesting, d is the one that says

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,480
you should consider 2 square root of 2 and negative 1, but not infinity, so there's a good contingent

127
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
of you out there who would just reject infinity as being considered real, but are very comfortable

128
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,640
with the square root of negative 1, that's awesome. And then after that, it looks like c,

129
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
people who reject the square root of negative 1, fascinating, I actually would have thought that

130
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,160
none of them would have come higher than that. None of them is much lower at a. Okay, so it looks

131
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,080
like we've got a cohort of people who are comfortable with negative 1, a large cohort are

132
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,720
uncomfortable with infinity, that's a topic for another day, don't worry about it, and then a

133
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,640
number of people who are kind of in that middle ground of maybe not being super comfortable with

134
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,560
the idea that negative 1 might be real. Let's see if we can convince you of the difference of that.

135
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,560
So for our first much more mathematical question, as kind of a warm-up, I just want to ask you to

136
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,160
add these two. Before I've taught you how to add them, make a guess at how it might work, and

137
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,520
I hope that it feels pretty straightforward, addition is actually the least interesting part

138
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,760
of this, but it is, it's a good thing to know when you're learning about complex numbers.

139
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,400
It's definitely one of those operations that you are going to need to know.

140
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,280
Unfortunately, and you can tell by the fact that I'm stalling and what I'm saying here,

141
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,440
it looks like the question is still not loading completely correctly, so I'm going to have a

142
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,120
stern word with Cam and Ider behind the scenes who have otherwise built such a beautiful,

143
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,200
beautiful interface that's helpful for this kind of back and forth between you guys and me. I'm

144
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,960
going to have a stern word with them behind the scenes, but in the meantime let's go ahead and

145
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,040
move forward with the lesson here. So I guess I can pull it up on the, just on the piece of paper,

146
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,440
and you can follow along at home, see what the addition might be. It turns out to be relatively

147
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
straightforward. If you're moving four units to the right and then one unit up, and you want to

148
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,680
add the idea of moving two units to the left and then two units up, well you just do each of those

149
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,120
one at a time. I'll go ahead and pull out black here. The real part is going to be those four to

150
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,480
the right, then minus two to the left. Okay, straightforward enough. And then the imaginary part

151
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,520
is going to be this one unit up and then these two units up, one plus two, times i. So is that one i

152
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,480
plus two i. And then when you work that out, four minus two is two, one plus two is three.

153
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,480
A nice simple introduction here. Addition doesn't really have anything complicated going on, which

154
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,520
is great. That means that it's one fewer thing for us to worry about. What is so complex about

155
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,960
complex numbers after all? Well where everything becomes interesting is when you try to multiply

156
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,320
these numbers together. So with vectors, there's not really any notion of multiplying them to get

157
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,160
two vectors back, at least when we're in the 2D plane. You have some notions like cross products

158
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,640
and dot products that in three dimensions can get you something like it. But the rules end up being

159
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,880
very different from that in the number system. You can't really do algebra. You can't do things like

160
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,360
assume that if two numbers multiply to make zero, then one of them has to be zero. But complex

161
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
numbers are going to end up behaving much like the real numbers, so rules from algebra can carry

162
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:47,120
over. But to understand what that multiplication rule is, I just want to ask you a simple question.

163
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,480
Which is basically, suppose I have the point three, two. We're not even going to think of it as a

164
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,680
complex number per se. If I just have some sort of coordinate grid and I go to the point with

165
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,960
x coordinate three and y coordinate two, what is the 90 degree rotation of this? If I rotate it 90

166
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:15,360
degrees and let's say counterclockwise. I think see counter, counter, geez, writing is difficult.

167
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,280
Counterclockwise.

168
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:30,240
Okay. Now what's lovely about this is we can basically just turn our paper to figure it out.

169
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,720
You say okay if it started at three, two and then I rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, I can just

170
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,680
read that off now as being negative two in the x direction and then three in the y direction, if I

171
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,040
had rotated the whole plane like that. So what we've done here is we've taken three, two and then we

172
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,600
convert it to negative two, three. Something which maybe in our original system

173
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,240
you know looks like this negative two and then three. That's going to be the 90 degree rotation.

174
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,880
And what's nice here is that that rule is very simple and it applies to any pair that we might

175
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,360
have. If I took a pair of numbers a comma b okay and then I said where is that going to rotate to

176
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,120
if I rotate it 90 degrees it's going to end up by swapping the coordinates b a and then making

177
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,480
that first one negative. That's a 90 degree rotation and a nice gut check here is to say

178
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,920
what happens when we do that twice what if we do that same very mechanistic operation again twice

179
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,760
and I'm going to go and take this I swap the two coordinates we get a negative b but then that

180
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,680
first one becomes negative. So that was another 90 degree rotation. Well what's happened here is

181
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,120
we've just made both of the coordinates negative and that's reassuring because if I take some point

182
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,960
sitting at a b and then I rotate it 90 degrees so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation

183
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,000
and then another 90 degrees that's the same as 180 degree rot- oh no I've done that wrong.

184
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That will be the same as a 180 degree rotation which should look like this ignore the other

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,720
vector that I drew which is just taking both of the coordinates and making them negative

186
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,680
negative a negative b okay so that's reassuring this operation that does a 90 degree rotation

187
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,840
actually behaves like you would expect it to. Now why am I asking you this? Well I'm being told that

188
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,800
supposedly I'm allowed to ask you questions again so I'm going to have you do your very first

189
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,880
complex product. Oh look a lot of people did submit answers very good. Great let's let's

190
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
grade the complex addition actually let's let's see if it is as straightforward a process as I

191
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,400
was hoping it was and see how much explanation is demanded. Okay so it looks like a majority of you

192
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,120
did get the correct answer which is 2 plus 3i. Very good very good. 52 of you answered simply 2

193
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,960
which would have been the real part of the answer so maybe just the fact that there's some vertical

194
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,520
component and you need to still add those vertical components or maybe those of you who answer 2

195
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,000
reject the reality of imaginary numbers so you just don't even acknowledge that vertical

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,080
component. Some of you answered negative 2 3 which I guess is just making that's just swapping

197
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,320
up whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus 4 so that's completely understandable. We've got 2

198
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,240
plus 3 which is maybe just dropping off the i so I think maybe a lot of like simple errors and entry

199
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,160
and you know that happens to all of us especially on tests is sometimes you know what the right

200
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,440
answer is but then you you forget a symbol or you swap two so that's all very good. Let's go ahead

201
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,400
and try our very first product though like I said so here because I already talked through one of

202
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,240
the questions we're going to go ahead and skip ahead of it we know how to rotate something like

203
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:51,680
3 comma 2 so I'm not even going to give you time to do that and properly grade it. Stal stal words

204
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,760
words you know they tell me that it's working and yet it's very slow for me to progress forward so

205
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,520
you know if I'm not going to have a stern word with them you guys can go at them on twitter too

206
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,520
under the same place that we ask questions and just say hey kamineter can't you make the live

207
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,960
questions work a little bit better for us? Okay I think we're finally there. Everybody ready? Aha!

208
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,240
Wonderful! Very simple question I want you to take the number i and I want you to multiply it by 3

209
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,040
plus 2i and even though I haven't really talked about the rules for multiplication what I can say

210
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,200
is pretend like it operates just like it does for normal numbers you've got things like the

211
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,920
distributive property where you can distribute this throughout and then the defining feature of

212
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,400
i is this idea that i squared is negative one that's the only special thing you need to know

213
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,760
about that other than that just treat it like it's a normal number okay and then proceed forward with

214
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,560
the product. Wonderful! Okay so it looks like we've got quite a few of you coming in to answer which

215
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,680
is always lovely super exciting for me by the way just how many people are enthusiastic about coming

216
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,080
and like getting back to the fundamentals of math in this lockdown and just you know we're going to

217
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,080
sit back for an hour and we're going to learn about complex numbers and we're actually going

218
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,280
to participate we're actually going to answer questions as you do it rather than sitting in

219
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,840
passively watching this is genuinely delightful to me. Okay this is this isn't necessarily a

220
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,680
question I was expecting to divide the audience necessarily so unsurprisingly it looks like we

221
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,600
have a very strong majority in one direction hopefully in the correct direction but if not

222
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,200
that would that would heavily inform where the lesson should go so that would be quite useful

223
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,840
and I think that's probably enough time so I'm going to go ahead and lock the answers into this

224
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,160
one okay and it looks like the majority of you answered negative two plus three i which is

225
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,920
absolutely correct absolutely correct so there's two ways to think about this okay one of them is

226
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,480
to walk forward with the algebra and just do it a little bit mechanistically okay so if we pull

227
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:04,880
ourselves up our sheet if we take i times three plus two i three plus two i it just distributes

228
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:13,360
i times three is going to be three i i times two i is going to be two times i squared by definition

229
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,120
i squared is negative one which means that our final answer is going to look like negative two

230
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,480
plus three i okay and like I said it looks like a majority of you correctly did that product now

231
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,800
it's one thing to just walk through it mechanistically it's another to step back and say

232
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,840
what just happened geometrically right because what we just talked through was the fact that

233
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,480
if you want to rotate numbers 90 degrees the rule is to swap the two coordinates and then multiply

234
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,600
that first one by negative two well look at what's happened here we've got three and two those

235
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,880
coordinates have been swapped two is now the real part three is the imaginary part but that two got

236
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,480
multiplied by a negative one because i has this defining feature of squaring to become negative

237
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,160
one so that should give you some indication that okay multiplying by i has this action of rotating

238
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,880
things by 90 degrees maybe that means that it's not a crazy thing to do to geometrically position

239
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,680
i at a 90 degree angle with the real number line okay now to really see why that ends up being

240
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,200
useful it turns out that if you have that if you have a number that behaves this way it gives you

241
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,840
a computational mechanism for all of the other types of rotations that you might want to do

242
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,720
that might not necessarily be 90 degrees and to show you why this works i'm going to go ahead and

243
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,440
pull up an animation so let's say we have any number z and in this case z is going to be let's

244
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,160
see where do i have it z is going to be at two uh plus i great and let's say i want to understand

245
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,720
what is multiplying by z due to every other possible complex number well we can go one by one

246
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,840
the very first one that's relatively simple is if i ask what is z times one where does it take the

247
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,280
number one well z times one is going to be z so we're going to take the number one which i might

248
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,640
draw with a little yellow arrow and we're going to rotate and stretch that arrow up to the point

249
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,760
where z is great a kind of trivial fact even though it's trivial i'm actually going to take

250
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,640
a moment to write that down just so that we can oh no no no that's for that's for later that is

251
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,160
randy don't you guys worry about him he'll be coming in in just a moment so i just want to write

252
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,680
down three crucial facts that are getting an influence rotation three facts i'll call it three

253
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:38,720
facts about multiplication the first two are going to look simple the third one is going to

254
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,520
look innocuous but it ends up being extremely constraining so the first one is that if i have

255
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,280
any number z and i multiply it by one will i get the number z back okay geometrically that means

256
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,480
with that we stretch and rotate that vector one to get what we want the second one is that if i

257
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,160
take z times i from what we just talked about that is the 90 degree rotation what i might write

258
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,720
is like rotate by 90 degrees the number z okay so often our animation what does that look like

259
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,080
let's see we've already multiplied by one we take i and then it's going to move to whatever the 90

260
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:20,480
degree rotation point for z itself is okay so two down infinitely many to go okay we know what it

261
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,240
does to one we know what it does to i let's see if we can understand what z does to any other

262
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,520
possible number well it turns out those two is really all we need to work with if we have the

263
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,720
distributive property so the third fact that's going to look kind of innocuous is let's say i

264
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:44,880
take this z and i multiply it by c plus d times i where c and d are just any two numbers okay well

265
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
this is going to distribute so z times c i'm actually going to write that a little differently

266
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,600
i'm going to write it as c times z plus z times di which again i'm going to write in kind of a

267
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:06,000
funny order and write that as d times z i now the idea here is well we know where z is we also know

268
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,960
where z times i is so if we're just scaling them up by some other constants that completely

269
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,040
constrains where we need to go so let me go ahead and write this down with an example okay

270
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,440
let's say that we go back here and i want to know what multiplying by z does to anything i want to

271
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,680
tell i want to convince you that it rotates all of the grid in a way that keeps these lines

272
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,280
parallel it keeps them evenly spaced keeps them perpendicular to each other it applies this very

273
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,760
constrained rule to the whole plane and really just think through any one particular point for

274
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,200
this let's say that we have two times negative i okay so you move two units in the positive right

275
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,400
direction and then negative one unit in the vertical direction well after the product

276
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,880
where that's going to land has to be two times wherever z lands plus negative one times wherever

277
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,680
i lands okay and we see that right it's two times this yellow vector and it'll be negative one times

278
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,960
the green vector so here even before you actually work out the product we could just read off the

279
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,880
fact that z here which looks like it's two plus i multiplied by two minus i must land on the number

280
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,720
five okay so i actually want you guys to work this out algebraically because i do think that it's

281
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,760
it's edifying to see this work in practice right the fact that we have this geometric rule where

282
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,320
we're just kind of stretching and rotating and this corresponds to an otherwise very mechanistic

283
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,960
process of expanding out a sum so let's pull back our quiz and i'm going to

284
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,360
it's a little bit silly because i've revealed the answer but what i actually want you guys to do

285
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,920
here is take a look at the question which says what is two plus i times two minus i and if you

286
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,200
have notes right now if you have a pencil and paper which i encourage you to always come to

287
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,880
class with i want you to try working it out do the first inside outside last distribution

288
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,360
property just to see mechanistically what number ends up popping out from this and then we'll try

289
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,080
to see how that squares with the geometric intuition so while you're doing that while

290
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,240
you're working that out hopefully on pencil and paper it looks like we've got a question from the

291
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,680
audience which is is i the same as i and j the vectors in physics great question actually that's

292
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,160
that's a much more interesting question than you might think it is the short answer is no so in

293
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,800
physics you often describe the right word direction as i and then the up and down direction as oh we

294
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,800
got another one here let me finish answering the question first so in physics you often have this

295
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:45,440
situation where instead of describing the xy plane you describe the right vector as i sometimes i hat

296
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,840
and the vertical one as j hat so that's a separate thing that's uh how physicists will describe the

297
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,600
right direction up direction for vectors they're not necessarily describing complex numbers

298
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,960
totally separate thing what's more interesting actually is that the reason that convention came

299
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,800
about uh i believe has to do with a number system that extends even beyond complex numbers it's

300
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,440
called the quaternions so with the complex numbers we introduce something called i with the quaternions

301
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,560
we introduce j and k these two other numbers both of which also have squares to negative one

302
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,880
as it happens and the guy who invented them hamilton he was trying to describe three

303
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,400
dimensional space very elegantly and using the purely imaginary directions i j and k became a

304
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,440
nice way to do that and i think it's because of that and his attempts to push that forward

305
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,200
that the conventions slipped into uh normal physics to just describe those as i and j of

306
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,480
course that leads to serious confusion now because if we look at how physicists think of things you

307
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,520
know i is in the right direction j is in the vertical direction but with complex numbers i is

308
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,480
of course in the vertical direction so it just makes for a whole potential mess um now what was

309
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,880
our oh no it looks like they took away the comment oh man there was a comment giving them some sass

310
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,760
and then they got embarrassed so they pulled it away well it's on screen it's in there for everyone

311
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,320
in the future to see now i think that's probably been enough time to work through a little bit of

312
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,840
algebra here so let's go ahead and grade it for everyone to see and it looks like the vast

313
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,000
majority of you well i told you the answer so i'm going to assume the vast majority of you

314
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,400
are giving the correct answer oh interesting okay so it looks like uh five five is correct and

315
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,640
that's the most common answer but then the ones uh where missed were three and four and maybe we

316
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,320
can try to understand why three and four would have been common um misconceptions on this one

317
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:42,640
69 is close 0 i plus 5 is correct but i guess just uh formatted in a weird way um so let's

318
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,560
let's go ahead and work this one out by hand okay it's actually you know kind of a pleasant process

319
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,600
to multiply complex numbers because it's so deterministic you know what you have to do you

320
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,200
know where you start you know where you're going to end and it's really just kind of practicing

321
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,520
through it um so two times two that's the first thing that we get and then you take the inside

322
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,240
parts i times two so that's going to be 2i and then the outside parts which is negative i times

323
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,560
two so that's negative 2i and then the last part which is i times negative i so that'll be negative

324
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,520
i squared the defining feature remember is that i squared is the same as negative one which means

325
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,440
that the real component of our answer is going to be two times two or four now minus negative one

326
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,120
which is plus one so that'll be five and then the imaginary parts cancel each other out that

327
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,000
2i cancels out with a negative 2i so to everyone on the quiz who answered uh five plus zero i uh

328
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,240
you know extra credit to you because that actually is 100 correct you're even emphasizing that we're

329
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,520
doing this in a complex context so there's no reason that you should have been graded

330
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,040
incorrectly on that one um however what's uh what's interesting here those of you who

331
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,560
watch the very first lecture might notice the similarity with difference of squares

332
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,240
and this is effectively a difference of squares type question and i'm going to guess that those

333
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,800
of you who answered three or four it probably came down to if you answered three it would have

334
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,520
been because you took this four and you subtracted one rather than subtracting negative one very

335
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,960
common mistake no harm in that and then if you answered four it comes from forgetting the fact

336
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,040
that i squared can be simplified into a real number so that you know that very much counts

337
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,840
for the the real component of your final answer now what's interesting i think is that that

338
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,120
process of just walking through the algebra feels very different from this geometric idea that we

339
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,200
had before of saying multiplying by z has the action of rotating and stretching things and how

340
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,920
it rotates and stretches things is in the way that's necessary to get the number one to sit on

341
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,880
the number z and in fact i have a i have a good friend uh ben sparks who is a frequent number file

342
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,240
uh contributor that some of you might recognize and i asked him uh to whip up a little geogra

343
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
thing because he's just a geogra whiz and he actually created basically the complex number

344
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,320
equivalent of a slide rule that we can play with here so the way that this is going to work is that

345
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,840
i can take the number one and sort of drag it around the plane and as i do the rest of the grid

346
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,560
moves in the way that it has to so that the origin stays fixed in place and then everything else kind

347
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,520
of stays rigid with the exception of being able to stretch so the way that you might use this is to

348
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,840
say let's say we want to know what z times w is well i'm going to stretch and rotate the number

349
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,960
one so that it lands on z and then i'm going to follow what happens to w which is now drawn as a

350
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,960
orange vector follow what happens to w and as it lands there we can just read off that it ends up

351
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,240
at five now even though in practice computationally you would be working it out with the algebra like

352
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,720
we just showed having in the back of your mind that this is how they operate helps draw the

353
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,360
connection between complex numbers and geometry and also trigonometry which we'll get to in a

354
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,120
moment and that turns out to be a much more helpful connection than you might expect so

355
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,400
let me go ahead and ask you guys a second question here which is bring back our helpful little friendly quiz

356
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,400
given what i just told you about how complex numbers act i want you to guess for me it's

357
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,040
okay if you don't know it's okay if you just want to hazard a guess here what is the complex number

358
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:27,920
z so that multiplying by z has the effect of rotating 30 degrees or pi sixth radians

359
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,440
counterclockwise okay so you want to number z so that when it's being applied as an action and

360
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,120
you're saying what do you do to all the other possible complex numbers the corresponding

361
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:45,520
action is to rotate by pi six radians or 30 uh 30 degrees okay great we've got a lot of answers

362
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,400
coming in strong consensus around one of them which is always a good sign let me show you uh

363
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:00,080
how i might draw this out um if i were doing things so i would take a look at um a unit circle of some

364
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,080
kind and luckily i have my infinite supply of unit circles sitting right here and i would say okay i

365
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,400
know that the action that i want is going to be whatever takes the number one to something that's

366
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,720
the 30 degree rotation of the number one that sits up here whatever complex number z this is

367
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,200
is going to have the appropriate action and then from there it's all of the trigonometry that you

368
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,440
and i were working through last time so let's look at our answers and let's go ahead and lock them

369
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:33,040
into place now before we talk through the explanation and the correct answer in this context

370
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,400
is d which is cosine of pi six plus i sine of pi six congratulations to the uh majority of you

371
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,760
who correctly answered that very interesting to me actually is that the second most common answer

372
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,480
was a which is one plus pi six um and i think that's that's an utterly reasonable guess actually

373
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,200
and let's take a look at why so if we go back to our our friendly unit circle the number we were

374
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,720
going for is uh like i said sitting pi six radians around and from everything we talked

375
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,480
about last time the x component of that is the cosine of pi six this is sort of how cosine is

376
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:23,520
defined and then the y component of that is going to be sine of pi six which means that that number

377
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,920
z that we're dealing with okay is going to have an x component of cosine of pi six

378
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,200
and then an imaginary component what's in the y direction of sine of pi six

379
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,360
great now that second most common answer like i said that's very interesting um if we pull it up

380
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,960
it was a which was one plus pi six over i let's take a look at where that sits with a i'll bring

381
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,520
in a second cleaner unit circle here like i said i've got an infinite supply they were guessing

382
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,920
that it's one and that instead of walking pi six around that you walk to straight up pi six okay

383
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,880
which is actually quite close right especially for small angles if you're just walking straight

384
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,960
up that's not too different from walking around the circle so if you were to try to use that

385
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,640
number um to have the action of rotating by 30 degrees it would have an action of rotating by

386
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
something that's slightly less than 30 degrees and they would stretch things out by something

387
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,280
that's slightly more than a factor of one but it's actually close um which is cool because usually

388
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,080
the misconceptions might be like very wrong computationally but the idea that the uh the

389
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,880
misconception here was like computationally quite close indicates that maybe the geometric reasoning

390
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,080
was lining up with truth which i think is awesome so to give you an illustration of how this might

391
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,200
actually be used okay we have a number that has this action of a 30 degree rotation um i want to

392
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,880
bring in uh of course a friendly pi creature for us to all think about

393
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,000
brandy so let's say that i have a pi creature and i'm i don't know animating a video and at some

394
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,680
point for whatever reason i want that pi creature to rotate 30 degrees okay i just want them to

395
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,480
rotate there's lots of ways you could do this one of the most common ones in computer graphics is to

396
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,000
use matrices which might be a whole topic for another day but a tactic you could use is to use

397
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,440
complex numbers and the way this would work is to think of our pi creature as living in the complex

398
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,160
plane and then at any kind of computer graphics it's always defined with various points often

399
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,560
these control points around it and each one of those control points i would give complex

400
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:36,400
coordinates to so for example let's say the the lower right foot here or i guess stage left our

401
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,360
right looks like it has coordinates about one negative three so that would be given the number

402
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,400
one minus three i and then from what you guys just told me in answering the question if we want

403
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,440
to take that point and then figure out where it gets when we rotate 30 degrees about the origin

404
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,280
what i should be multiplying it by is cosine of 30 degrees by sine of 30 degrees and if ever you

405
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,320
wanted to be convinced that complex numbers are just as real as real numbers i think one factor

406
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,280
to consider is that many programming languages have built into them complex numbers they are

407
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,240
considered as real as real numbers so what i might do i could pull up a little python terminal for

408
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,240
us to play with and complex numbers if i write something like three negative one are considered

409
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,280
a valid type in this case they use j um i think basically because in programming parlance i is

410
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,240
often used as an indexing variable so they just go with j instead that actually matches with

411
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,120
electrical engineering convention too where they instead of using i for the imaginary number they

412
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,640
use j because again i was kind of already used so three minus one j you can just read that as being

413
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,600
the same as three minus one i and i can take this number and i can multiply it by other complex

414
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,720
values i don't know like five four two if i multiply that it's going to apply the rules of

415
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,080
complex multiplication which basically is just foiling it out you can think of this as being the

416
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,360
real part is three times four or 12 minus negative one times two because remember that i squared

417
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,680
gives us that negative so that's where the 14 comes from and then the imaginary part is going

418
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,200
to be that negative one times four which is negative four plus three times two which indeed

419
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,240
works out to two so that's kind of cool python seems to be working all of this out for us and

420
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,320
what that means remember is let's say that we wanted to rotate our pi creature and let's say

421
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,160
i'm just going to focus on one point like his foot sitting here which is at one negative three

422
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:37,680
so let's say i define the foot to be uh sitting at real part one imaginary part negative three

423
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,560
uh the rotating number that i want z is what you guys figured out for me we're going to need a

424
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,760
little math for this so let's import math always a sign that you're about to have some fun so we're

425
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,680
going to call z a complex number whose real part is the cosine well i can't write 30 degrees because

426
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,160
this will all be in radians so i'll write it as pi six that's the same thing as 30 degrees

427
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:07,120
and then the y is going to be the sine of that sine of math dot pi over six great so if we look

428
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:13,360
at its components uh the real part is around 0.866 and the imaginary part should be exactly

429
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,600
one half but you know often you get a little numerical error because computers they can't get

430
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,200
all the real numbers perfectly there's just not enough information in the universe so they have

431
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,880
to have a little bit of an error there some of you might recognize that uh that first part is

432
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,680
the square root of three divided by two this is everything we were working out last lecture for

433
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,520
computing things like the cosine of pi six now what this means for us is if we take z times foot

434
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,200
right or remember foot was that one negative three z times foot should tell us where it goes when you

435
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,600
just go through the mechanistic operation of complex multiplication this point should tell us

436
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:54,960
where it lands evidently it's supposed to land at around 2.3 as a real part and then negative 2.09

437
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,680
as the imaginary part and indeed when we play that out and we follow our little foot point here

438
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,360
where does it land all right it looks like the real part is a little above two and the imaginary

439
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,760
part is a little less than negative two and any deviation there is probably because the foot

440
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,240
wasn't exactly at that point one negative three like i said but you can see what i mean in

441
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,880
principle you tell the computer to do this for every single point in a given image that you want

442
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,040
and it will tell you where the outputs should be it'll tell you where the rotated versions should

443
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,440
be so complex numbers are certainly as real as real numbers in that respect um it looks like

444
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,720
we've got a question from the audience so let's go ahead and pull that up seal programmer asks what

445
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,840
is the biggest reason that people use vectors and matrices to represent rotation instead of complex

446
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,520
numbers that is actually a very interesting question i don't know if there's a great reason

447
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,600
actually because if all you're going to do is rotate and then potentially scale things you

448
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:56,000
could have everything defined in terms of complex numbers in 2d graphics in 3d graphics that actually

449
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,800
wouldn't work complex numbers only describe rotations in two dimensions however if you

450
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,840
want to use a number system to describe rotations in three dimensions instead of using matrices you

451
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,440
could use these things called quaternions which are they're basically the complex numbers on

452
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,880
steroids and in fact they they expose you to fewer errors like there's errors that come about

453
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,160
when you try to use matrices for 3d rotation this thing called gimbal lock talk to any roboticist or

454
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,880
any computer graphics programmers they'll tell you that gimbal lock is a real pain and the quaternions

455
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,320
this sort of complex numbers on steroids helps to solve that problem there's a whole other contingent

456
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,640
of people who feel passionate about something called geometric algebra that is a whole other

457
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,480
topic potentially for another day but that's that's a really valid question you've got these

458
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,200
two perspectives on one one possible operation but if we're just coming at it from the idea that

459
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,680
complex numbers play a role in other parts of math and in other parts of engineering

460
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,880
i think thinking of the rotation implications really helps us see that and this is particularly

461
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,680
visceral for me when i think in terms of trig identities so if you remember at the very beginning

462
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,080
i opened up by talking about one particular trig identity and without pulling it up again i don't

463
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,120
want to go back and just read off of it i'm going to ask you one more question which this is going

464
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,920
to be a tricky question this one will actually take some time to work through which is i want

465
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:24,800
you to calculate for me the cosine of 75 degrees okay and let's go ahead and pull this up as a quiz

466
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:32,080
question so let's pull up our quiz let's move on to the next question let's cross our fingers and

467
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,240
hope that cam and eater have not broken anything again and that's all it's asking what is the cosine

468
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,480
of 75 degrees okay now let me get you started here on how you might think about it 75 degrees

469
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,280
it's not going to be based on any triangles that we might have seen maybe you've seen a 75 degree

470
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,640
triangle and you happen to remember what its side lengths were but most people won't have

471
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:03,440
however what you can do is note that 75 is the same as taking 45 degrees and then walking another

472
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:12,080
30 degrees around okay 45 plus 30 degrees and if our question is asking us for the cosine of 75

473
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,600
one way to think of it is if you first walk 45 degrees around and then you walk another 30

474
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,640
degrees around what is the x coordinate of that corresponding point okay so this is going to have

475
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,920
some coordinates x y the cosine of 75 degrees is asking for the x coordinate of that now like i

476
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,120
said i think this is um this is not easy okay so it's going to take some time to work out and while

477
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,400
you guys are working this out i want you to actually pull out some pencil and paper and

478
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,840
think it through i'm just going to pull up a little pause and ponder music and give us i don't

479
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,160
know i might give us a full 60 seconds or so to like noodle this one out and think it through

480
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,520
and in the meantime if you want to ask any questions you know how to do so through twitter

481
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,560
it's with the hashtag lockdown math and i might go ahead and take a couple questions while people

482
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,040
try working this out by hand which again i heavily encourage you to do even if you're not watching

483
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,520
this live even if you're watching this at a later date this is the time to say okay i'm going to pull

484
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,840
out my paper i'm going to try to think this through and and now i'll stop talking i'll let you just

485
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:20,720
think

486
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,680
certainly don't feel rushed by the way even if there are some answers rolling in right now

487
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,840
that is by no means any indication that you should have finished or anything like that

488
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:55,840
so

489
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,760
so interestingly we do have a strong lead but it's not at all a strong second place so it seems like

490
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,880
the way that the assuming that the lead is correct the way that the errors have happened

491
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,320
is not in a consistent way which is interesting and that'll be

492
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:31,760
that'll be fun to dissect once we reveal what the answers are

493
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,960
so let's um let me check if there's any new questions that have rolled in

494
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,080
no huh which suggests to me that the two folks that i have behind the scenes who are supposed

495
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:55,760
to feed me questions are probably desperately wrangling with uh something item pool related

496
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,080
those of you who have already submitted an answer or who think you already know the answer by the

497
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,680
way i want you to take a moment to seriously guess what you think the second most common

498
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,560
answer is going to be and where exactly the misconception could have taken place

499
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,920
or to double check your work you very well might be one of those sitting in the um the

500
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,040
misconception territory which you know it's uh it's a lot to work out there's

501
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:36,320
a lot of different failure points along the way

502
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,120
all right so with that i'm going to go ahead and lock in the answers and if you wanted to still

503
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,720
work it through even if the answer isn't going to be recorded that's totally fine we're going to

504
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,880
walk through it in a moment but i'm going to lock them in just so that we can see um what the

505
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,280
correct answer turns out to be and the correct answer is d which it looks like a majority of

506
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,640
you got so that's awesome um the second most common was c which really only differs by a minus

507
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,520
sign and i can i can actually guess why that's true already so that's that's interesting um

508
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,080
after that is b where there's a square root of three instead of a square root of two okay so we

509
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,320
have we actually have a pretty good distribution on this i think that this shows that this is not

510
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,680
at all an obvious question and can take um take a little bit of noodling to figure out so if i saw

511
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,000
this on a test okay let's say that someone threw like a high school math test at me right now and

512
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,040
it said cosine of 75 you know i would know that in principle i'm supposed to be thinking of this

513
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,920
as uh in terms of friendlier angles i know that 45 degrees is a friendly angle for trigonometry

514
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,520
and i know that 30 degrees is what i don't have memorized though are the addition formulas uh i

515
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,920
learned them once slipped out of my head definitely don't have them memorized but i do know how to

516
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,120
re-derive them on the fly basically the idea is that we take the complex number associated with

517
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:07,680
the 45 degree rotation which is going to be cosine of 45 degrees plus i times the sine of 45 degrees

518
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,520
i take that complex number and i'm going to rotate the complex number corresponding to a 30 degree

519
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,960
rotation so i might even just pull up yet another unit circle here and say the one that sits 30

520
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,360
degrees away i want to multiply it by this number well what is that number its x component is the

521
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:34,320
cosine of that so the real component is the cosine of 30 degrees and then the imaginary component

522
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,200
okay the vertical component here is the sine of 30 degrees which looks like it's you know

523
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,040
the smaller leg of a 30 60 90 triangle which is going to be one half but we'll work out the numbers

524
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:51,280
in just a moment sine of 30 degrees times i and by the magic of complex multiplication which i

525
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,840
hope isn't magical based on what we walked through a little bit earlier the effect that this will have

526
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:02,400
is to rotate by one and then rotate by the other so what are these values cosine of 45 degrees

527
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,120
is the square root of 2 divided by 2 sine of 45 degrees is the square root of 2 divided by 2 and

528
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,840
if you want to if you don't remember that and you want to work it out the way to think about it is

529
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:24,240
that a 45 degree angle is going to create an isosceles right triangle so if we don't know what

530
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,840
this side length is we at least know that it's the same as the other side length so if the

531
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,880
hypotenuse is one we know that x squared plus x squared is supposed to equal one that's the

532
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:40,240
pythagorean theorem that tells us that 2x squared equals one so x squared is the square root of one

533
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,440
half and then that's actually the same as writing the square root of 2 divided by 2

534
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,400
you could also write it as 1 divided by the square root of 2 if you want but these are these

535
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,280
are equivalent forms so if you forget you just draw the triangle it's no big deal cosine of 30

536
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,400
degrees well if we have our 30 60 90 triangle the long side of that from everything we talked through

537
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,000
in the last lecture is square root of 3 over 2 square root of 3 over 2 and then the sine of 30

538
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,120
degrees is one half and now we just carry out the complex product it's not exactly a fun prospect

539
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,760
maybe but it's really just four operations so it's not going to be too bad the real part is going to

540
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,560
be our cosine times our cosine okay so that's going to end up being our square root of 2 over 2

541
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:35,200
multiplied by square root of 3 over 2 okay i'm also going to package in when we multiply both

542
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,680
imaginary parts okay i guess i was a little inconsistent i wrote i times sine and then sine

543
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:47,360
times i but it's the same thing so i'm going to include that square root of 2 over 2 multiplied

544
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:53,520
by the one half but because each of them has an i we also multiply it by i squared which by

545
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,520
definition is negative 1 so we get this negative sign in here and that's going to be the real part

546
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,480
okay which is actually all we need we just need the real part and that gives us the uh that gives

547
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,840
us the x coordinate of the where did i drop before here we go if we rotate 45 degrees then we rotate

548
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:17,520
another 30 the x component of that the real part is going to be the final answer so we'll do the

549
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,120
sine part in a moment too when we make it more general but just for the sake of answering the

550
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:28,880
question this ends up being root 2 times root 3 which is root 6 divided by 2 times 2 so root 6

551
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,840
over 4 minus and that minus sign came about because of the i squared minus square root of 2

552
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:45,280
over 4 okay so all in all that ends up being root 6 minus root 2 divided by 4 and if we pull up the

553
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,960
question um i think it's very interesting that the second most common uh answer the the most common

554
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,000
mistake you might say is only different because of that plus sign and if we look at the math where

555
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,480
that came from as it happens is the idea that this was a minus sign which came about from the

556
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,440
idea that there was an i sitting in front of each sign so the most common misconception came from

557
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,400
maybe forgetting to apply the fact that i squared is equal to negative 1 at least if you were going

558
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,880
about it using complex numbers which from the whole context of the lecture of course we want to

559
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,800
so this actually corresponds to a much more general formula and i think it's edifying to

560
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,520
write out that general formula for ourselves because anytime that i've forgotten what the

561
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,880
sum of two angles in trigonometry should be it's totally okay because you can re-derive it

562
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,600
relatively quickly if you're comfortable with complex multiplication and the more math that

563
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,000
you do because it shows up all over the place you actually get very comfortable with complex

564
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,200
multiplication even if you like me become very rusty on things like trigonometric identities

565
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,160
but with that comfort you can very quickly re-derive what the angles should be or what the

566
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:02,400
some identities should be sine of beta writing and talking at the same time so remember the way

567
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,640
to think about this is that this first number is what we get by finding a complex number that's

568
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,720
basically just rotating alpha around the unit circle if you rotate an angle of alpha around

569
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,600
that's what this first number is this second number tells us what you would get if you rotate

570
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,960
an angle beta around so let's say there's some other angle which i might write down here the

571
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,680
whole angle from the x-axis would be how should i write it i'll write it as beta that doesn't

572
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,280
really connote that it's the full angle just bring i'll just i'll just do it as a separate

573
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,480
a separate friend over here

574
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,680
beta so i think like when i when i see these terms cosine alpha plus i sine alpha i think in

575
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,320
my head very visually of a point on the unit circle in the complex plane similarly i think

576
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,880
of a point on the unit circle in the complex plane and i know that multiplying them together

577
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,240
means that the action of one of them is rotating the other so the final result we know is going to

578
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:11,920
be the point that sits alpha plus beta around alpha plus beta plus i times the sine of alpha

579
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,480
plus beta wonderful but on the other hand if you go through the mechanistic foil operation

580
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,720
you will get an alternate expression for the answer and by having an alternate expression

581
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,440
you have an identity which i think is pretty cool it's a sign that when you have a non-obvious

582
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,280
relationship like the algebra of complex multiplication and the geometry of complex

583
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,720
multiplication you can leverage that non-obvious relationship to get yourself real identities okay

584
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,080
so how does this work the real part is going to consist of multiplying those cosines so we have

585
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:50,160
cosine alpha times cosine of beta and then it also consists of the two imaginary parts multiplied

586
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,640
together because that i squared becomes real i times sine i'd say i won't write anything here

587
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,360
it'll be that sine of alpha and then the sine of beta

588
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,680
and because we have an i squared we can consider that a negative one okay so it's cosine alpha

589
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,480
cosine beta minus i sort of accidentally started writing a plus so we're just going to live with

590
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:22,720
that minus sine of alpha plus sine of beta sine of alpha times sine of beta okay obviously it's

591
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,560
a lot of algebra but it is satisfying the idea that you don't need to memorize this and again

592
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,840
do this regularly when you do complex multiplication regularly you can kind of see this pop out where

593
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:37,440
you're like oh yeah it's the the real the two real parts minus the two imaginary parts that as a

594
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,240
pattern is something you start to recognize and that when you want the imaginary part of the

595
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,120
product that you take the other two like in this case it's going to be i times sine times cosine

596
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:56,480
so the sine of alpha times the cosine of beta plus the cosine of alpha times the sine of

597
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:04,720
beta the cosine of alpha times the sine of beta long complicated formula all of that times i

598
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,400
this long complicated formula is giving you the angle and some identities and sometimes you can

599
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,600
write this out in a much more compact form this this is not a commonly used notation and i'll

600
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:21,520
explain why in a moment but sometimes uh cosine plus i sine of something comes about commonly

601
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,040
enough it has this meaning on the unit circle that it's written as c i s okay in this case

602
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,840
c is of alpha so everything that we just wrote down could be written more compactly as c is of

603
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:45,600
alpha times c is of beta is equal to c is of alpha plus beta okay this is communicating the very

604
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:52,640
non-trivial fact that complex multiplication lets us you know lets us work out rotations in the way

605
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,000
that we want to again that's not standard notation and i'll explain why there's a much more standard

606
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
way to write these but it's weird so i don't want to just kind of throw it down there but before we

607
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,720
do that i want to illustrate how you can do a little bit of magic when you have this proper

608
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:13,280
intuition for complex numbers and and how they multiply so let me pull up our quiz again and

609
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:22,480
let's move on to another question and this question asks which of the following values of z

610
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:30,400
satisfies z squared equals i okay so there's two ways that you can think about this i'll

611
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,400
talk about them both and i'm just going to give you a moment to kind of think this one through

612
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,320
so

613
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,840
and and while you work that out let me go ahead and take a question from the audience

614
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:58,800
achmed osama asks what is an application that is impossible to achieve without complex numbers

615
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,600
convince me that they are needed they're fun to work with maybe but they made things easier

616
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:10,320
but can we do without them um i would say i believe yeah you can absolutely work without them

617
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:17,040
because you can basically use rotation matrices in place of complex numbers so what's nice about

618
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,040
complex numbers is that when you're adding things and when you're multiplying things you're dealing

619
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,840
with the same type they're both complex numbers but if you wanted to describe this all with

620
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,160
matrices and vectors and such when you're adding stuff you'd be adding vectors but then when you

621
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,240
want to do rotation type actions and stretching type actions you'd be transferring to instead

622
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,400
dealing with matrices so that's fine you just have to keep that jumbled and use them differently

623
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,480
i'd be willing to bet pretty much anything you can do with complex numbers you could do there

624
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:49,200
it'll become much less elegant and i guess one of the one of the main things that would be

625
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,080
just really awkward is the fundamental theorem of algebra which we'll talk about in a moment but it

626
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:58,640
basically says anytime you have a polynomial of degree n so the highest term you see is something

627
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:05,200
like x to the n among the complex numbers it has n different solutions so that's very elegant it's

628
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,280
very nice to work with it definitely makes the lives easier of anyone who's working with

629
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,080
things where polynomials come about to include matrices and things like i don't want to like

630
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,560
throw around terminology but when you're computing eigenvalues and such you find yourself with

631
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:24,080
polynomials often of high degree and it's nice to have solutions to them i can conceive of

632
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,160
constructing some kind of way to work with the numbers where you have like solutions to all of

633
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,160
these where the solutions are expressed in terms of vectors and matrices and so maybe the strict

634
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,720
answer to your question is you could do without them you definitely would not want to life for

635
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,520
mathematicians and quantum physicists and really anyone who works with like linear algebra and

636
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,280
polynomials would just become incredibly awkward so in some very real sense they are a natural

637
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:56,640
construct so much so that even if you could do without them conceivably you never would want to

638
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,240
it would really make things quite the pain so coming back to our quiz here it looks like again

639
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,040
we've got a lot of strong consensus which is good and let me go ahead and create this

640
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,760
all right so the correct answer is a okay it's root two over two plus root two over two i it

641
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,440
looks like the majority of you got that and okay so very interesting is that the second most common

642
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,560
answer was d that no solution exists without extending beyond the complex numbers because

643
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,880
the question we're asking in this context is basically to take a square root of i so if you

644
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,000
think of oh i is defined to be the square root of negative one i think a common question is to say

645
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,760
you know how deep does this rabbit hole go okay if we had to make up an answer to the question

646
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,360
square root of negative one do we have to make up another one for the square root of i and the

647
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,920
square root of that and just kind of keep extending and extending and it's interesting and surprising

648
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,640
that once you have i you have pretty much everything else that you want at least when it

649
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,800
comes to solving anything that looks like a polynomial okay so the answer here there's two

650
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,360
ways to think about it one of them is the brute force way and then one of them is the more elegant

651
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,600
way so the brute force way looks like this you're reading through the multiple choices and you just

652
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:13,040
kind of try them out and in this case when you try out square root of two over two plus square root of

653
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:19,360
two over two times i and you square it so we're going to multiply it by itself i'm going to

654
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:26,240
actually do this just to illustrate that it's possible and that it's not super fun taking root

655
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:33,280
two times root two for that first real part is going to give us two divided by two times two so

656
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:40,720
two over four the real part will also include the products of the imaginary parts because of that i

657
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,120
squared so we're going to have root two over two times root two over two which like we just saw

658
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,520
oh excuse me that was supposed to be two over four you can tell them a little all over the place

659
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,040
today which you know just because sometimes complex numbers get me excited root over two

660
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:03,040
times root two over two is going to be another two over four but this time it's times i times i

661
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,520
so we're going to have a negative in there okay that's going to be the full real part

662
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,760
and then the imaginary part is going to come from the cross terms something where there was only one

663
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,480
i included so two over two i times root two over two it's the same product we're doing over and

664
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,560
over it's always two over four and then we're going to add root two over two times root two

665
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:29,680
over two i so we're going to add the same thing and i'm not writing the i's here because i'm going

666
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,960
to factor it out okay so the real part involves subtracting these the imaginary part involves

667
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,160
adding them and indeed when we subtract them that real part is zero and when we add them that

668
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:48,640
imaginary part is one so we just get zero plus i or i and okay it works but imagine that you

669
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,160
looked at this question and it wasn't multiple choice right someone asks you to find a square

670
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:58,000
root of i if if the only option you have is this terrible brute forcing it seems like a very

671
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,200
painful process right to try every number try squaring it if this is what you have to do but in

672
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,600
an insane trial and error it would seem like magic if someone just pulled that answer out of a hat

673
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,000
but if you're thinking about it geometrically it's actually a pretty straightforward question

674
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,280
to ask because what you're saying is we want a number such that z squared is sitting where i

675
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,320
is right it's sitting one unit above well if we know that rotation corresponds to complex

676
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:29,680
multiplication right that means what we want is a number that rotates by 45 degrees

677
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:37,360
because if you have a number that rotates by 45 degrees then when you multiply by it twice that's

678
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:44,800
the same as rotating 90 degrees so it gets you up to i all right well what number is that we

679
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:49,200
could think of it in terms of sines and cosines if we want you know this is going to be cosine

680
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:58,720
of 45 degrees this vertical part is going to be the sine of 45 degrees and it's root 2 over 2 for

681
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,320
each of them this is something we were working out just by looking at the uh the isosceles right

682
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:12,640
triangle each one of these is equal to root 2 over 2 so that's very fun simply by thinking of

683
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,360
the geometry you could pull out of your hat the fact that the square root of i or i should say

684
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:23,360
a square root of i is root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 i another answer would have been what

685
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:31,280
happens when you rotate not 45 degrees but if you were to rotate 40 45 plus another 180 degrees

686
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:38,320
okay so 45 plus 180 actually gets us 225 degrees all the way around that's another number where if

687
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:47,040
you multiply by it twice it'll have the effect of rotating you a grand total of 360 plus 90 degrees

688
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:52,160
it'll kind of rotate you all the way around and then an extra 90 so in the same way that most

689
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:58,240
positive numbers have two square roots you know square root of 25 is 5 but it's also negative 5

690
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:04,160
and in the same way that even negative numbers like negative 1 has two square roots not only is

691
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:10,400
it i but negative i also satisfies this property that when you square it you get negative 1 even i

692
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,440
itself has two square roots and in general everything except for 0 has two square roots

693
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,160
0 you might consider to have like a double root but again that's sort of a story for another time

694
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,600
so that's pretty magical and now let me show you another bit of magic okay something where again

695
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:30,240
you can come at a question that seems like it's going to involve just insane trial and error but

696
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,280
if you're thinking about the geometry of it you're able to come to a pretty uh a pretty meaningful

697
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:45,200
answer relatively quickly all right what's our question here the equation x cubed equals 1 has

698
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:52,080
one real number solution x equals 1 makes sense you cube 1 you get 1 among the complex numbers

699
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,600
there are two more solutions which of the following is one of them okay so this time

700
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:03,680
it's actually asking us to cube uh some kind of complex number or to verify that when you cube it

701
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,720
you're going to get one i'll give you some some time to sort of think about that

702
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,640
and in the meantime let me take a sip of water and then take the question from the audience

703
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:32,880
so what do we have you showed that in order to find the cosine of a sum of two angles you can

704
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,240
multiply two complex numbers does that mean that if i need the cosine of a subtraction of two

705
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,360
angles i need to divide two complex numbers wonderful question yes yes it does mean that

706
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,800
and dividing by a complex number is actually the same as multiplying by one in the same way that

707
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:54,560
dividing by two is the same as multiplying by one half you basically say two has the action

708
01:06:54,560 --> 01:07:00,320
of stretching the number line by two um one half as a multiplier has the action of squishing

709
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,880
everything down by a factor of two that's kind of the inverse action when it comes to complex

710
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,960
numbers to divide by it you ask what's the inverse action so an example here might be let's say

711
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:19,840
let's pull up something here let's say i wanted to rotate uh you know negative alpha that's what

712
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:25,120
i want to do so i'm going to do like cosine of beta minus alpha or something like that that number

713
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:33,200
could be considered the inverse the multiplicative inverse of what you get by rotating alpha the

714
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:39,680
other way so up here we have i'm just going to write it as c is for cosine plus i times the sign

715
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:49,280
of alpha the inverse number over here is c is of negative alpha right that number is one divided

716
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:55,600
by this i could even write it out over here to say c is the number that's alpha the way along

717
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:03,920
a unit circle is equal to one divided by c is of negative alpha and vice versa if i took one

718
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:12,160
divided by c is of alpha this is equal to c is of negative alpha now everyone who knows euler's

719
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,720
formula is kind of screaming at me that there's an easy way to see this in terms of exponentials

720
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,720
which is of course where we're getting with this but because it's weird this connection between

721
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,240
complex numbers and exponentials i don't want to just throw that down right away i do want to

722
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,280
emphasize that this is this should all make sense before anything like euler's formula enters the

723
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:35,360
picture if you think of c is as being what basically a function to ask where do you end up if you walk

724
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:41,280
alpha units around the unit circle in the complex plane it's the upper it's the number that you can

725
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:48,000
use for for rotating things by alpha degrees so dividing by it will also get you rotating the

726
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,880
other way but the the overall answer there is that division is the same as multiplication so that's

727
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,680
absolutely the right instinct you can derive for yourself the angle what would you call them the

728
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:03,680
trigonometric difference formulas if you wanted to great so i think that's probably enough time

729
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:10,000
if we punch back to our quiz and let's tone down the pause and ponder music here it seems like

730
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,880
answers have sort of stopped rolling in so this is as good a time as any to grade things so the

731
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:24,160
correct answer here of the four options that we were given ends up being drum roll please negative

732
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:29,760
one half plus the root three over two times i now i just want you to imagine for a moment that

733
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,480
if you didn't know any of the geometry of complex numbers someone asks you this question and if you

734
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:40,160
were able to spit it back decently quickly it makes you look like a machine right because you

735
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,200
would imagine that the only way to answer this is to look at each number and then cube it that you

736
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,840
have to go through and do the whole first inside outside last but twice because you're cubing it

737
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:55,360
for each one of those and then deduce that answer b turns out to have this property that we want

738
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,040
geometrically there's a very nice way to see it so let's go ahead and pull it up

739
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:10,800
what we want is an action so that when you do it three times you end up back at the uh back at one

740
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,880
basically i want if i were to multiply by this number three times i end up back at one

741
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,720
let me clear for myself a nice new piece of paper here

742
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:29,680
so just remind ourselves what we're looking for which is x cubed is equal to one okay so one such

743
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:34,720
action is the do nothing action right if you multiply by one which does nothing yeah do that

744
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,920
three times you end up back at one that is our real solution the other ones would be to rotate

745
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:48,320
a third of the way around the circle okay to rotate 120 degrees or you could rotate 120 degrees

746
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,480
the other way which is equivalent to thinking of rotating 240 degrees around those are other

747
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,520
actions where if you do them three times it's the same as doing nothing if i rotate 120 degrees

748
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,840
then do that three times i cube it that's the same as doing nothing that's how you can read

749
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,520
this equation which i think is very nice and elegant rather than just trying to plug in

750
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:13,360
numbers and see what comes out so using the trig that we learned about last time this again comes

751
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,480
from a 30 60 90 triangle you can see that the real part is negative one half and then the

752
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,320
imaginary part is the square root of three over two so even before working it out i can know with

753
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,280
confidence that if i were to go through the painstaking process of taking negative one half

754
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:35,360
plus the square root of three over two and cubing that i'm going to get back one i don't have to go

755
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,800
through that process to know that that's going to happen which is pretty magical this also answers

756
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,560
for us a mystery that we had in the last lecture if you guys remember what we did is we pulled up

757
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:53,760
desmos so let's go on back let's go on over to chrome let's open up a desmos tab and let's get

758
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,720
rid of whatever else was going on in here and what we played with was the idea that if you take a

759
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:04,800
cosine graph and then if you square it the shapes look remarkably similar you have this bizarre

760
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,080
relationship where squaring cosine looks like squishing it and more specifically we were able

761
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:15,120
to play around and say if you double the frequency of that cosine wave and then you manipulate it in

762
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,040
some other ways we're going to shift it up and then we divide it by two this is all something we

763
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,480
did last time we got an identity between them but this raised an interesting question what on earth

764
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:30,400
does cosine of 2x have to do with cosine of x squared well now with complex numbers we can

765
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,400
actually know the answer we can work this out we know that if you rotate around by theta degrees

766
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:46,400
okay if we call that number z then when we rotate around another theta degrees this new number is z

767
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:56,560
squared right and z is what i was calling c is of theta which we could expand out as saying cosine

768
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:05,200
of theta plus i sine of theta and we can work out that square nearly algebraically

769
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,360
we take cosine of theta plus i sine of theta

770
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,920
the real part of that is going to come from two products of the real part so it's going to be

771
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:24,000
cosine squared of theta but then also two parts of the imaginary and because of that i it becomes

772
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,200
negative one so we'll end up with negative sine squared of theta and then the imaginary part is

773
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:39,440
going to come from you know i might as well just write this out in full cosine theta plus i sine

774
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,920
i realize i'm kind of running against the edge which is why i was hesitant to do this

775
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,600
but basically that cosine squared comes from taking the cosine times the cosine the negative

776
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:55,920
sine squared comes from taking i sine times negative i sine our remaining terms are going

777
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:02,800
to be that cosine plus i sine so cosine theta times sine of theta

778
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:10,720
and then there's going to be an i i'll just write it out times i and then we get exactly the same

779
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,640
thing sine of theta times cosine of theta times i so sine of theta times cosine of theta

780
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:26,880
times i which we could factor out this whole last part ends up just being two times the cosine of

781
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:37,760
theta times the sine of theta right all of that times i so what we've done here is basically said

782
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,200
there's two ways to think about cosine theta plus i sine theta squared one of them is oh of course

783
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:48,000
it doubles the angle right so that's going to be cosine of two theta on the other hand algebraically

784
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,120
it's equal to deep breath cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta plus two cosine theta

785
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:59,440
sine theta i now that might seem like a big pain but the big pain is showing us an identity it's

786
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,640
showing us the double angle identity so what we found here just to summarize on the real part

787
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:11,840
is that the cosine of two theta the real part of what happens when we rotate by that twice

788
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,440
when we rotate by that twice is equal to cosine squared of theta minus sine squared of theta

789
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,600
now from another trig identity that we were working with last time sine squared of theta

790
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:36,080
is actually the same as taking one minus cosine squared this was the alternate way of expressing

791
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:41,600
the pythagorean theorem so we can get everything written in terms of cosines and what we have

792
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:49,600
is now two times cosine pardon the messiness of the handwriting here by the way two times cosine

793
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:58,240
of theta all minus one that is evidently equal to the cosine of two theta and we could rearrange

794
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:04,000
that further and see what we were playing around with in desmos that this cosine of 2x expression

795
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:11,600
over here this cosine of 2x expression corresponds with squaring the cosine this was a reflection of

796
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,400
the fact that cosine relates to complex numbers which i think is pretty cool okay and as the very

797
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,640
last thing that i want to mention i want to talk about why we didn't um why nobody really uses this

798
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:32,400
cis notation right i was saying that cis of alpha is not really standard notation when we're talking

799
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:39,040
about rotating alpha around the unit circle as a reminder this was my shorthand for cosine plus

800
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:46,240
i sine the reason is because what you're always going to see instead through electrical

801
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,960
engineering through quantum mechanics through math through all sorts of things is instead the

802
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:56,640
way that this is written is actually before i show you how it's written no no i'll just i'll

803
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,240
just show you how it's written it's it's it's weird and we're going to talk about it at length

804
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:06,640
next time but you imagine that you're raising something to a power okay e to the i times alpha

805
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,920
um now this obviously makes a lot of people very uncomfortable first of all if you don't know about

806
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:17,680
e what is e and then secondly what on earth does it mean to raise something to an imaginary power

807
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,040
so that is a full lecture's worth of material i do want to talk about it next time

808
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,720
but just to to give an indication of why this might not be a totally crazy thing

809
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:30,720
okay i want you to remember the core property that we wrote down earlier

810
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:37,280
that when you rotate alpha around the unit circle and then when you rotate another beta

811
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:44,640
around the unit circle this is the same thing as alpha plus beta which means our cis function

812
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,360
has this kind of interesting property that adding the inputs is the same as multiplying the outputs

813
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:55,360
so with that i want to ask one final quiz question to try to relate this to other functions that you

814
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:00,080
might be familiar with and at this point it might be halfway obvious where we're going with this

815
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,400
but as the very final question to cue you up for where we're going to go next time

816
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,680
and maybe appreciate the relationship at play here and why it's not that crazy

817
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:15,040
i want you to answer which of the following functions satisfies f of a plus b is equal to f

818
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,920
of a times f of b okay

819
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:38,160
so i'm being told by the way that um when i advance the questions too quickly it kind of

820
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,160
reveals the answer of the next one which happened all throughout last lecture and you guys certainly

821
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,400
told me about it again this is one of those things where like this is what happens with live

822
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,520
production we thought we had fixed that um usually you know this is a very weird process for me

823
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,040
because usually when i make videos you catch some kind of error so you edit out the error then you

824
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:00,000
put out the video this is an experience for me is much more like all right world here it is raw

825
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,560
here are the errors as they come i hope you enjoy watching them happen because there's no editing

826
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,960
it does not get clipped out this is math presentation raw all right so as we do this

827
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:16,960
it looks like a pretty pretty strong consensus i'll give you a little bit more time to submit

828
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:23,920
the answers

829
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:33,920
all right and with that let's go ahead and take a look so the question is what function has this

830
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,760
property where adding the inputs looks like multiplying by the outputs so uh 2700 of you

831
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,960
correctly answered that two to the x an exponential function behaves this way looks like the most

832
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:51,760
common second answer was a that logarithms which makes sense there's an identity in logarithms that

833
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,520
looks very similar it's basically the opposite so if we were to you know write this out i might say

834
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:06,960
two to the a times two to the b is equal to two to the a plus b and when we're thinking in terms

835
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,440
of repeated multiplication this makes a lot of sense because one of these is saying multiply in

836
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:18,160
a copies of two then multiply in b copies of two and the result should be well a plus b copies of

837
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:24,000
two the rule with logarithms is exactly the opposite and it's because logarithms are the

838
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,200
inverse of multiplication on that front it looks like taking the log of a plus b ends up being the

839
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:41,360
log of a sorry the log of a times b multiply log of a plus log of b logarithms is another thing

840
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,400
i think we're going to talk about in a later lecture of this series so if you don't know about

841
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,960
them don't worry but to those of you who answered that totally understandable it's because it's a

842
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,360
very similar property but it's just getting mixed up whether the outputs are being added or the

843
01:20:53,360 --> 01:21:00,800
inputs are now what you'll notice is how strange this factor that comes about because two to the

844
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,720
x is defined as repeated multiplication looks very similar to the rule that we found for complex

845
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:11,120
numbers that sit on the unit circle that multiplying the outputs is the same as adding

846
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,280
the inputs and that should be very suggestive that there might be some kind of unifying theory

847
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,800
between them which of course there is it has everything to do with why we write things as

848
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,560
e to the i theta which i actually think is kind of a bad convention the good thing about it is that

849
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:33,040
it does make it pretty obvious when you take e to the i theta times e to the i beta sorry e to the i

850
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:38,880
alpha that you're allowed to just add them it really highlights that fact which otherwise you

851
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,240
kind of have to think through but maybe that's a good thing that you kind of have to think it

852
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:47,360
through and you're not just blindly applying rules but i'm going to talk all about that next time

853
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:52,240
we're going to dig deep into uh euler's formula a way that you can try to understand what is this

854
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:56,640
really saying like computationally it's not talking about repeated multiplication so what

855
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,360
could you do if you are on a desert island with a bunch of paper to just work out by hand the fact

856
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:08,080
that this is a reasonable expression all of that is to come next time so thank you for joining

857
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,240
apologies for being mildly scattered throughout
