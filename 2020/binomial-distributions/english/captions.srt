1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
You're buying a product online, and you see three different sellers.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,200
They're all offering that same product at essentially the same price.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,640
One of them has a 100% positive rating, but with only 10 reviews.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,740
Another has a 96% positive rating, with 50 total reviews.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,560
And yet another has a 93% positive rating, but with 200 total reviews.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,360
Which one should you buy from?

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,038
I think we all have this instinct that the more data we see, 

8
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:33,240
it gives us more confidence in a given rating.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,990
We're a little suspicious of seeing 100% ratings, 

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,979
since more often than not they come from a tiny number of reviews, 

11
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:42,146
which makes it feel more plausible that things could have gone another 

12
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:43,440
way and given a lower rating.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
But how do you make that intuition quantitative?

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,864
What's the rational way to reason about the trade-off here between the 

15
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:53,260
confidence gained from more data versus the lower absolute percentage?

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,402
This particular example is a slight modification from one that John Cook 

17
00:00:58,402 --> 00:01:02,160
gave in his excellent blog post, A Bayesian Review of Amazon Resellers.

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,209
For you and me, it's a wonderful excuse to dig into 

19
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,600
a few core topics in probability and statistics.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,000
And to really cover these topics properly, it takes time.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,434
So what I'm going to do is break this down into three videos, 

22
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:17,402
where in this first one we'll set up a model for the situation, 

23
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,860
and start by talking about the binomial distribution.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,234
The second is going to bring in ideas of Bayesian updating, 

25
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:26,380
and how to work with probabilities over continuous values.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,415
And in the third, we'll look at something known as a beta distribution, 

27
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,088
and pull up a little python to analyze the data we have, 

28
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:36,980
and come to various different answers depending on what it is you want to optimize.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,214
Now, to throw you a bone before we dive into all the math, 

30
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:44,898
let me just show you what one of the answers turns out to be, 

31
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,240
since it's delightfully simple.

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,324
When you see an online rating, something like this 10 out of 10, 

33
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:54,352
you pretend that there were two more reviews, one that was positive and one 

34
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:55,200
that's negative.

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,479
In this case, that means you pretend that it's 11 out of 12, which would give 91.7%.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,080
This number is your probability of having a good experience with that seller.

37
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:13,044
So in the case of 50 reviews, where you have 48 positive and 2 negative, 

38
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:18,755
you pretend that it's 49 positive and 3 negative, which would give you 49 out of 52, 

39
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:19,360
or 94.2%.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,840
That's your probability of having a good experience with the second seller.

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,705
Playing the same game with our third seller who had 200 reviews, 

42
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,440
you get 187 out of 202, or 92.6%.

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,660
So according to this rule, it would mean your best bet is to go with seller number 2.

44
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:42,604
This is something known as Laplace's rule of succession, 

45
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:45,850
and to understand what assumptions are underlying this, 

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,951
and how changing either those assumptions or your underlying goal can change the choice 

47
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:54,140
you make, we really do need to go through all the math.

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,359
So without further ado, let's dive in.

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,512
Step 1, how exactly are we modeling the situation, 

50
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,080
and what exactly is it that you want to optimize?

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,496
One option is to think of each seller as producing random experiences that are either 

52
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:15,958
positive or negative, and that each seller has some kind of constant underlying 

53
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:20,643
probability of giving a good experience, what we're going to call the success rate, 

54
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:21,480
or S for short.

55
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,100
The whole challenge is that we don't know S.

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,429
When you see that first rating of 100% with 10 reviews, 

57
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:31,120
that doesn't mean the underlying success rate is 100%.

58
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,920
It could very well be something like 95%.

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,584
And just to illustrate, let me run a little simulation, 

60
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:42,556
where I choose a random number between 0 and 1, and if it's less than 0.95, 

61
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:47,660
I'll record it as a positive review, otherwise record it as a negative review.

62
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,301
Now do this 10 times in a row, and then make 10 more, and 10 more, 

63
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:59,512
and 10 more, and so on, to get a sense of what sequences of 10 

64
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:05,220
reviews for a seller with this success rate, would tend to look like.

65
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,520
Quite a few of those, around 60% actually, give 10 out of 10.

66
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,460
So the data we see seems perfectly plausible if the seller's true success rate was 95%.

67
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,039
Or maybe it's really 90%, or 99%.

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,680
The whole challenge is that we just don't know.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
As to the goal, let's say you simply want to maximize your probability of 

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
having a positive experience, despite not being sure of this success rate.

71
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,448
So think about this here, we've got many different possible success rates for 

72
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:39,096
each seller, any number from 0 up to 1, and we need to say something about how 

73
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:43,920
likely each one of these success rates is, a kind of probability of probabilities.

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,196
Unlike the more gamified examples like coin flips and die tosses and the 

75
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:52,211
sort of things you see in an intro probability class, 

76
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:55,785
where you go in assuming a long run frequency, like 1.5 or 1.6, 

77
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:59,694
what we have here is uncertainty about the long run frequency itself, 

78
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:02,040
which is a much more potent kind of doubt.

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,367
I should also emphasize that this kind of setup is relevant to many many situations in 

80
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:11,720
the real world where you need to make a judgment about a random process from limited data.

81
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,566
For example, let's say that you're setting up a factory producing cars, 

82
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,840
and in an initial test of 100 cars, two of them come out with some kind of problem.

83
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,568
If you plan to spin things up to produce a million cars, 

84
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:29,292
what are you willing to confidently say about how many total cars will have problems 

85
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,460
that need addressing?

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,005
It's not like the test guarantees that the true error rate is 2%, 

87
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:36,660
but what exactly does it say?

88
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,560
As your first challenge, let me ask you this.

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,985
If you did magically know the true success rate for a given seller, 

90
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:51,054
say it was 95%, how would you compute the probability of seeing 10 

91
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:56,200
positive reviews and 0 negative reviews, or 48 and 2, or 186 and 14?

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,160
In other words, what's the probability of seeing the data given an assumed success rate?

93
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,329
A moment ago I showed you something like this with a simulation, 

94
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:10,251
generating 10 random reviews, and with a little programming you could just do 

95
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,526
that many times, building up a histogram to get some sense of what this distribution 

96
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:15,080
looks like.

97
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,435
Likewise, you could simulate sets of 50 reviews, 

98
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:29,080
and get some sense for how probable it would be to see 48 positive and 2 negative.

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,580
You see, this is the nice thing about probability.

100
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,812
A little programming can almost always let you cheat a little 

101
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,480
and see what the answer is ahead of time by simulating it.

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,740
For example, after a few hundred thousand samples of 50 reviews, 

103
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,960
assuming the success rate is 95%, it looks like about 26.1% of them would give us this 

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
48 out of 50 review.

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,440
Luckily, in this case, an exact formula is not bad at all.

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,820
The probability of seeing exactly 48 out of 50 looks like this.

107
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,037
This first term is pronounced 50 choose 48, and it represents the total 

108
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:08,040
number of ways that you could take 50 slots and fill out 48 of them.

109
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:13,789
For example, maybe you start with 48 good reviews and end with 2 bad reviews, 

110
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,660
or maybe you start with 47 good reviews and then it goes bad good bad, and so on.

111
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,175
In principle, if you were to enumerate every possible way of 

112
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:29,187
filling 48 out of 50 slots like this, the total number of these patterns is 50 choose 48, 

113
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,860
which in this case works out to be 1225.

114
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,000
What do we multiply by this count?

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,298
Well, it's the probability of any one of these patterns, 

116
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:40,943
which is the probability of a single positive review raised to 

117
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:44,820
the 48th times the probability of a single negative review squared.

118
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,230
Crucial is that we assume each review is independent of the last, 

119
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,549
so we can multiply all the probabilities together like this, 

120
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:56,792
and with the numbers we have, when you evaluate it, it works out to be 0.261, 

121
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,220
which matches what we just saw empirically with the simulation.

122
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,672
You could also replace this 48 with some other value, 

123
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:09,305
and compute the probability of seeing any other number of positive reviews, 

124
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,500
again assuming a given success rate.

125
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,852
What you're looking at right now, by the way, is known in the business as a 

126
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:23,160
binomial distribution, one of the most fundamental distributions in probability.

127
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,809
It comes up whenever you have something like a coin flip, 

128
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:31,080
a random event that can go one of two ways, and you repeat it some number of times, 

129
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,200
and what you want to know is the probability of getting various different totals.

130
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,375
For our purposes, this formula gives us the probability of seeing the data given 

131
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:46,146
an assumed success rate, which ultimately we want to somehow use to make judgments 

132
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:50,860
about the opposite, the probability of a success rate given the fixed data we see.

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,440
These are related, but definitely distinct.

134
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,201
To get more in that direction, let's play around with this value of s 

135
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:02,580
and see what happens as we change it to different numbers between 0 and 1.

136
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,603
The binomial distribution that it produces kind of looks 

137
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:10,860
like this pile that's centered around whatever s times 50 is.

138
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,964
The value we care about, the probability of seeing 48 out of 50 reviews, 

139
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:18,680
is represented by this highlighted 48th bar.

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,600
Let's draw a second plot on the bottom, representing how that value depends on s.

141
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,320
When s is equal to 0.96, that value is as high as it's ever going to get.

142
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,419
And this should kind of make sense, because when you look at that review of 96%, 

143
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:39,319
it should be most likely if the true underlying success rate was 96%.

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,220
As s increases, it kind of peters out, going to 0 as s approaches 1, 

145
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,480
since someone with a perfect success rate would never have those two negative reviews.

146
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,560
Also, as you move to the left, it approaches 0 pretty quickly.

147
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,146
By the time you get to s equals 0.8, getting 48 out of 50 reviews 

148
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:05,200
by chance is exceedingly rare, it would happen 1 in 1000 times.

149
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,608
This plot we have on the bottom is a great start to getting a more 

150
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:13,380
quantitative description for which values of s feel more or less plausible.

151
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,908
Written down as a formula, what I want you to remember is that as a function 

152
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:23,371
of the success rate s, the curve looks like some constant times s to the 

153
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:28,080
number of positive reviews times 1 minus s to the number of negative reviews.

154
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,848
In principle, if we had more data, like 480 positive reviews and 20 negative reviews, 

155
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:36,940
the resulting plot would still be centered around 0.96, 

156
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,480
but it would be smaller and more concentrated.

157
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,220
A good exercise right now would be to see if you could explain why that's the case.

158
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,480
There is a lingering question, though, of what to actually do with these curves.

159
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,044
I mean, our goal is to compute the probability that you 

160
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,020
have a good experience with this seller, so what do you do?

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,833
Naively, you might think that probability is 96%, 

162
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:04,026
since that's where the peak of the graph is, which in a sense is the most 

163
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:05,160
likely success rate.

164
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,860
But think of the example with 10 out of 10 positives.

165
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,260
In that case, the whole binomial formula simplifies to be s to the power 10.

166
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,865
The probability of seeing 10 consecutive good reviews is 

167
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:20,650
the probability of seeing one of them raised to the 10th.

168
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,933
The closer the true success rate is to 1, the 

169
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,660
higher the probability of seeing a 10 out of 10.

170
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,980
Our plot on the bottom only ever increases as s approaches 1.

171
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,980
But even if s equals 1 is the value that maximizes this probability, 

172
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,302
surely you wouldn't feel comfortable saying that you personally 

173
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:42,520
have a 100% probability of a good experience with this seller.

174
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,855
Maybe you think that instead we should look for some kind of center 

175
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:50,400
of mass of this graph, and that would absolutely be on the right track.

176
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,826
First, though, we need to explain how to take this expression for the probability 

177
00:11:55,826 --> 00:12:00,629
of the data we're seeing given a value of s, and get the probability for a value of s, 

178
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,880
the thing we actually don't know, given the data, the thing we actually know.

179
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,980
And that requires us to talk about Bayes' rule, and also probability density functions.

180
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,060
For those, I'll see you in part 2.
