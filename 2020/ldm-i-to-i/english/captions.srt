00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
Welcome back to what is now the second to last in the Lockdown Math series.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,524
So we've been talking a lot about exponential functions and complex numbers and the 

3
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:13,629
interplay of the two of them, and I thought what might be a very nice culminating 

4
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:18,085
topic to help bring it all together and show really the full breadth of what exponential 

5
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:22,240
functions are and what they can be would be to talk about raising i to the power i.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,180
Now this is a, this is a funny little expression because usually if we 

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,368
think about powers, if we were doing something like i to the fourth, 

8
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:32,880
you know, we know how to think about it in terms of repeated multiplication.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,200
We're just multiplying something by itself four different times.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,288
And in general you'd like to think of i to the x as some variant of that, 

11
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:48,156
but as soon as x becomes a complex number, we should realize that it's really nothing 

12
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:49,180
like the above.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
So it's really nothing like this.

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,808
Instead, the way that we think about it is going to have to 

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,908
be very related to the way that we think about raising e to various different numbers, 

16
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,700
e being that kind of home base for us.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,858
And in fact if we go, oh no, that's not sure where things are going too much here, 

18
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:13,592
if we go ahead and rewrite that base i in terms of e, 

19
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:16,980
it can help us make sense out of this expression.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,700
But I don't want to do that, I want you to do that for me.

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,821
So if you head on over to 3b1b.co.live, link is in the description, 

22
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:31,414
it'll forward you on over to item pool, which now asks us write a value of x so that e to 

23
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:32,880
the x is equal to i.

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,180
That way we'll be able to replace it in the base of our expression.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,548
And then once we do that, maybe we can use our knowledge of e and 

26
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:44,740
exponentials of e in order to make some sense out of this expression.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,833
Now let me just add as a quick reminder while everyone is rolling in 

28
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:53,571
with answers for that, that when we write e to the x and complex numbers are in the mix, 

29
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,500
we are no longer talking about repeated multiplication.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,074
And instead I think the healthiest way to think about it is that 

31
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:03,480
e to the x is a shorthand for this polynomial that I might call exp.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,560
It's the, it's sort of the main exponential function.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,109
All other exponential functions derive from this in a 

34
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:11,780
way that I'll describe later on in this episode actually.

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,740
And it's, it's a lovely polynomial.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,040
It's 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6.

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,760
Each term looks like a power of x divided by the factorial of that power.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,990
So the reason for doing that is then it can actually 

39
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,460
make sense to plug in things like complex values.

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,498
And one of the things that we looked at earlier in the series was how if you're 

41
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:37,290
plugging in imaginary values, you know, let's say I go over here and I'm going 

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,081
to plug in i, where i is the square root of negative 1 times some value theta, 

43
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:44,920
we can very literally read off what it means to exponentiate it in that context.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,900
For example, this very first term 1 we might think of as a vector pointing from 0 to 1.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,777
The next term, which is some scaled version of i, well, 

46
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:56,780
it's a 90 degree rotation of that first vector scaled a little bit differently.

47
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,200
Then the next vector is a 90 degree rotation of that scaled differently.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,369
And depending on what this value theta equals, 

49
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:07,140
the way that these things scale is going to look very different.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,769
And it's in general a difficult thing to think about, 

51
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,440
but it's at least a sensible thing to think about, right?

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,201
So that when we go to our expression, e to the x, 

53
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:18,816
and we're going to start thinking about i in various complex numbers, 

54
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:21,140
it makes sense computationally what it means.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,350
And then there's going to be a separate illustration that I'll pull up 

56
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,200
in a moment for how it makes sense in terms of intuition what it means.

57
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,245
But first let's just see how people are doing on our live quiz, 

58
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,220
finding a value of x so that e to the x is equal to i.

59
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,580
Now.

60
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,040
How have people done here?

61
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,260
Okay, so the top answer is in a sense absolutely correct, you could say.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,280
By definition, the natural log is the inverse function of exponentiation.

63
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,240
So whatever the answer is here, we should be able to write it as natural log of i.

64
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,900
The problem is that's not really helpful.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,179
It's not going to move us forward, because if we if we tried to use that, you know, 

66
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,666
we pop over here and we say instead of writing i, 

67
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,596
I'm going to write e to the natural log of i, and then I'm going to be raising 

68
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,940
that to some kind of power.

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,902
It begs the question, and the only thing I can really do from 

70
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,800
here is simplify that down to be i, which sort of gets us nowhere.

71
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,063
So to move forward and to think is there a number, 

72
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:22,226
some concrete point on the plane that I can plug in, 

73
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:27,060
for that we'd want to look at, I accidentally skipped ahead of my questions here.

74
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,240
Let me go back, pull up people's answers.

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Got a little excited, a little trigger happy with some of my clicking around here.

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,086
And the second most common answer is something that's going to 

77
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:43,380
actually help us move forward here, which was one half of i times pi.

78
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,681
And then that's the same as what was written, what was categorized as the 

79
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,640
third most common one, one half pi times i, just swapping the two numbers there.

80
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,335
And I think, yeah, I think the one following that, 

81
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:58,431
I'm guessing people either forgot to mention the i, 

82
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,360
but let's just write that out and kind of see where this moves us.

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,720
One half i times pi.

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,825
Now, if you're confused about where that came from, 

85
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:10,438
I think this is a good time to remind ourselves of Euler's formula and 

86
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:11,660
what it's really saying.

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,719
It's one half pi times i, where again, computationally, 

88
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:22,109
this very literally means if we plug in pi over two for theta here, 

89
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:25,360
which would be something like 1.57 or so.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,957
Let me see if I can, I don't think I'll be able to get it right on the head, 

91
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:33,861
but something in the 1.57 range, if you were to play out this whole sum, 

92
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:36,856
the claim of saying that e to the pi halves i equals i, 

93
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:40,974
is that when you play all of this out and you add all of the terms together, 

94
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,900
you're going to get to the top here.

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,060
But usually this is kind of a complicated way to think about it.

96
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,900
People don't want to pull up this whole polynomial and imagine the spiraling sum.

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,611
I think it's helpful just in case you find yourself doubting the reality 

98
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:56,120
of what we're talking about or the fact that it's something sensible.

99
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,713
Almost always, anytime that people are thinking about complex exponentials, 

100
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:04,962
instead they find themselves thinking something like e to the i times theta, 

101
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,941
they just immediately know of, maybe not immediately, 

102
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,866
but you come to immediately know of Euler's formula, 

103
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:14,838
that it's telling you you walk a distance theta around the unit circle, 

104
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:19,087
which is to say an angle of theta radians, and whatever point you're sitting 

105
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,460
at on the complex plane, that's the output.

106
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,104
So people who knew about this would say, hmm, i as a number is also sitting on 

107
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:30,580
the unit circle, so I just have to walk an angle of 90 degrees pi halves radians.

108
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,160
And from here we can actually move forward and get kind of a funny looking answer, 

109
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,472
because that i will hop to the inside and we'll be looking at e to the pi halves times i 

110
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:39,860
squared.

111
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,780
i squared is negative one by definition.

112
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,060
So this looks like e to the negative pi halves.

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,120
That is a purely real number.

114
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,800
You could just plug that into your calculator and it's actually around 0.2 or so.

115
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,572
It's about a fifth, which is weird, uh, that you take an imaginary 

116
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:01,740
number and raise it to an imaginary power and that gets you a real number.

117
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,953
Um, maybe it feels a little bit weird that e and pi have shown up, 

118
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:10,312
not that much if we're thinking in terms of Euler's formula and all of that, 

119
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:13,200
but I kind of want to go deeper on this one, right?

120
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,880
I think it's one thing to plug in some numbers and see what pops out.

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,140
And there's a couple great videos who have talked 

122
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,160
about i to the i from some of my favorite channels.

123
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,840
Stand Up Math with Matt Parker, he talked about i to the i, did a beautiful job.

124
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,920
Black Pin Red Pin did another i to the i video, truly great.

125
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,345
One thing that I try to, you know, I try to do is add something 

126
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,240
into the mix if I'm talking about a topic that others already have.

127
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,475
And in this case, I think one of the most interesting questions you can ask before 

128
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:42,888
we jump in, I mean, there's lots of interesting things about this expression i to the i, 

129
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:47,102
but if we're seeking intuition, thinking about how i is a 90 degree rotation, right, 

130
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:51,020
that's the way that it acts when we're multiplying things on the complex plane.

131
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,296
We think of it very intuitively as the thing that upon 

132
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:57,740
multiplication turns stuff 90 degrees, or pi halves radians.

133
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,701
So when you look at this expression that i to the power i equals e to 

134
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:07,143
the negative pi halves, it begs the question, in what sense do two 90 

135
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,379
degree rotations combine to make this real number, 

136
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,900
this very specific real number of e to the negative pi halves around 0.2079, on and on?

137
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,673
And it's like those games that sometimes you play with arithmetic where someone says, 

138
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:24,247
oh, I'll give you the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6, see if you can combine them 

139
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:28,496
in some way with addition, multiplication, division, to get some other specific number, 

140
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,960
like 24, in that case is a particularly fun puzzle.

141
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,460
In this case, it's kind of like that style of puzzle on steroids.

142
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,629
How do we take the idea of a 90 degree rotation and combine it with itself twice in 

143
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:44,760
some mathematical sense such that we get out this number e to the negative pi halves?

144
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,420
Where's that intuition coming from?

145
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,764
And the first step, I would say, is to remind ourselves of the intuition 

146
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:56,300
for why it is that Euler's formula works, why it is that I can take an 

147
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,220
expression like e to the pi halves i and say that that's the same thing as i.

148
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,262
You know, I just showed what it means in a very, um, computational sense, 

149
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:08,920
what the claim is with this spiraling sum, but that tells us nothing about why, 

150
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,480
why it would be the case that this is how things behave.

151
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,657
Now I've at this point made, you know, quite a number of videos on variants of this, 

152
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:18,620
but I think the quickest one is to think of it dynamically somehow.

153
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,330
So if we take an expression like e to the i times t and we're thinking of that 

154
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,894
as describing a dynamic, you're going to have a position that changes over time, 

155
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:32,007
then what I'll do is I'm going to start drawing that with a blue vector, 

156
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:36,740
and we know as an initial condition that when we raise e to the zero, that's at one.

157
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,015
So where we are at time t equals zero is equal to one, 

158
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,180
but let's say that's all we know, right?

159
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,940
We haven't been told about Euler's formula, or how we should 

160
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,420
be thinking about it with circles or anything like that.

161
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,760
That's just where we're starting.

162
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,980
Well, one thing we might know is that e to the x is its own derivative.

163
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,904
So if we're thinking of dynamics here, we might ask about the velocity of our position 

164
00:09:56,904 --> 00:10:01,480
taking its derivative, and because e to the x is its own derivative, this is quite nice.

165
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,367
The outer expression, is going to stay the same, 

166
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:09,031
and then the inner expression as we're applying the chain rule is just i times t, 

167
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:11,420
so we multiply the whole outer thing by i.

168
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,920
And this gives us a literal way to read the equation in terms of dynamics, right?

169
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,671
What we're saying is take whatever your position vector is, 

170
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,966
if you rotate that 90 degrees, you apply this action of i, 

171
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,480
that's going to give you the velocity vector.

172
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,263
So wherever you're standing, draw a vector from zero, the origin, up to where you are, 

173
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,616
rotate that vector 90 degrees, that gives you your velocity, 

174
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:40,180
and that's enough to tell you how to move, assuming you know where you're starting.

175
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,422
And of course we have to draw this out in the complex plane, 

176
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:50,019
the fact that we've rotated 90 degrees already brings us there, 

177
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,766
and I could draw out a bunch of different potential position vectors, you know, 

178
00:10:55,766 --> 00:11:02,160
and what it would tell you is, okay, I've got to sit there, rotate my vector 90 degrees, 

179
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,100
that describes my velocity.

180
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,635
And it doesn't necessarily have to be any one of the points on that circle, 

181
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:10,089
any point in the plane, if you're following this dynamic, 

182
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,389
you say rotate that vector 90 degrees, which if we're drawing a vector field, 

183
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:15,420
we often scale down, and it's all well and good.

184
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,513
And here you could phrase this question without even talking about exponentials or 

185
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:25,101
complex numbers or anything like that, and in fact I'm going to go back to the quiz 

186
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:29,579
just to really emphasize that Euler's formula and what it's claiming and then how 

187
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,911
we apply it to expressions like i to the power i, it's very, 

188
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:36,735
it's really intuitive as soon as we're putting some dynamics into it, 

189
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:41,213
and we can ask questions removed from the idea of exponentials that actually have 

190
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:43,180
the same substance in their answers.

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,544
So here I want you to imagine starting a walk from the point 1,0 on the coordinate plane, 

192
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:55,444
in such a way that at all moments your velocity vector is a 90 degree counterclockwise 

193
00:11:55,444 --> 00:12:00,260
rotation of the vector drawn from 0,0, the origin, up to where you are.

194
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,680
After pi halves units of time, where will you be on the plane?

195
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,971
Okay, so kind of think about that, think about that 

196
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:10,640
dynamic and where you'll end up after a little bit of time.

197
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,040
While you answer, let me see if we have any questions 

198
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,560
that have popped in from the audience.

199
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,714
No questions at the moment, at least that I see, so if ever you do want to ask, 

200
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:33,264
go to Twitter, use the hashtag lockdownmath, those will be forwarded to me and then 

201
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:36,515
sometimes they'll be on the screen that I can pull up here, 

202
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,520
and that always makes for a fun time.

203
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,774
For example, it seems like now we actually have one, 

204
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:47,480
which is how about other solutions to the expression x equals i, such as 5 pi halves?

205
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,211
Oh, I'm so glad you asked, I'm so very glad you asked, 

206
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,980
we will certainly be talking about that.

207
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,191
And if you just hold on for like one little moment, 

208
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,101
that's exactly what we're going to get to, so I'll keep that on file for us to 

209
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:02,780
pull up in a little moment.

210
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,672
But right now while we're just trying to get intuition around the first, 

211
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,600
you know, there will be multiple answers.

212
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,840
The first answer we saw was e to the negative pi halves.

213
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,920
Let's consider this lake question.

214
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,286
So it seems like most of you correctly said that 

215
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,880
this would get you at the coordinates 0,1.

216
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,100
It's essentially walking you a quarter of the way around.

217
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,320
I said lake question.

218
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,026
I'm sort of picturing in my head as a big circular lake that you're going for 

219
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:34,751
a walk around, because when you have this rule for dynamics where your position 

220
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,830
vector rotated by 90 degrees gives you your velocity vector, that is circular motion, 

221
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,260
because the tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to its radius.

222
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,032
So this rule of motion corresponds with walking around a circle, 

223
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:50,620
and that's kind of the intuition for Euler's formula.

224
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,200
Right?

225
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,181
That you keep increasing that value of t, and this dynamical rule, 

226
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:58,858
if e to the i t is going to behave according to the derivatives that we 

227
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:02,740
expect of a function like e to the t, necessarily walks you around a circle.

228
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,314
So in particular, when we're wondering how long does it take to get to i, 

229
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:11,037
you would basically say just wait for an amount of time equal to, 

230
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:14,140
well, whatever the angle to get up there is, pi halves.

231
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,320
Okay, so in this case we're thinking pi halves.

232
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,980
Let me see if I can get it exactly on the dot.

233
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay, 1.57.

234
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,736
We're thinking of pi halves as kind of an amount of 

235
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,420
time for these dynamics to get you on the number i.

236
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,459
And that gives us the first half of our intuition if we want to go back to our formula, 

237
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,669
and we're asking in what sense do two 90 degree rotations combine 

238
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,420
to make e to the negative pi halves?

239
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,669
Once we're thinking of our dynamics here as each one of your velocity vectors 

240
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:44,736
as a 90 degree rotation of your position, this base i, 

241
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:49,086
the way that we're kind of thinking about it reading it off as something with 

242
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:52,878
meaning rather than just a number, is that as a point on the plane, 

243
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:57,339
it's where you get after traveling for pi halves units of time according to the 

244
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,800
dynamics of this expression, according to the idea that your velocity is always 

245
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,920
a 90 degree rotation of your position.

246
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,740
Okay, so that's awfully nice.

247
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,877
And in fact, there's already sort of two different i's at play here, 

248
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:11,160
which, or I guess there's three different i's at play.

249
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,640
We have this base, which is describing the 90 degrees that we walk around the circle.

250
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,142
We have the i that's sitting here, which is describing 

251
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:22,440
the rule of rotating your velocity vector 90 degrees.

252
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,333
But now we're going to introduce another i, which 

253
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,980
essentially has this effect of changing what your dynamics are.

254
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,646
Because as we go from e to the i times t, and instead we, you know, 

255
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:38,656
raise things to another power of i, which I'll just write with a little caret i, 

256
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:43,914
if we take e to the i t and we alter what that expression is by raising it to the i, 

257
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:46,080
what we get is e to the negative t.

258
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,020
Okay, so we have e to the negative t.

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,206
And if we try to interpret that with the same sort of dynamics that we 

260
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,800
had above in terms of a velocity and a position, 

261
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,226
what that's telling us is that the derivative of our new dynamic e to the 

262
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:11,460
negative t is equal to, well now the constant sitting in front of t is negative one, 

263
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:17,840
so our chain rule will have it be negative one times itself, times e to the negative t.

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
So whatever your position is, now your velocity is negative one times itself.

265
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,131
So the effect of raising to another power i, it's kind of like we took the dynamics, 

266
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:31,511
we looked at every velocity vector and we said rotate another 90 degrees, 

267
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:35,299
so that in this context it would actually be in the beginning a 

268
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:38,200
velocity vector pointing backwards with one unit.

269
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,841
So if you're starting off at the number one, your 

270
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,960
initial velocity is to walk straight toward zero.

271
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,424
And as you walk even lower, if you were sitting at one half, 

272
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:49,930
then you would still be walking towards zero, but now your velocity 

273
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,900
vector would be negative one times where you are, which is negative one half.

274
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,753
And what this means for the actual motion that this would imply, 

275
00:16:57,753 --> 00:17:01,490
you might kind of imagine it, I haven't animated this nicely yet or anything, 

276
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,419
but if you look at this whole vector field and you ask each one of those vectors, 

277
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:08,820
take wherever you are and rotate another 90 degrees, counterclockwise, 

278
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,119
they would all be pointed in towards the origin.

279
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,055
So if you were to have a little dot move in such a way that its velocity 

280
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:19,231
always matches whatever vector it's sitting on top of, 

281
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:23,677
what you would end up with is something where with each time step it kind of 

282
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:28,181
takes a step towards zero and it just with each of your time steps is walking 

283
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:32,511
towards zero and each step has a size that gets smaller and smaller as you 

284
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,840
actually approach zero.

285
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,980
And of course in practice, this would be a bunch of 

286
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,140
infinitesimal steps rather than very concrete sizing.

287
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,199
You might be very exact about it if you wanted and say what we're looking at 

288
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:50,598
is scaling down by some number just less than one and we're doing this n 

289
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:55,780
different times and then we're gonna multiply that by however much time we're waiting.

290
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,620
And you take this as a limiting expression.

291
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,856
That's just what we talked about in the compound interest lecture if you're curious 

292
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:07,660
and it's kind of the standard way to talk about e to powers as this sort of limit.

293
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,280
You could also have that t living on the inside here instead if you wanted.

294
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,070
But now if we think about our original point i, our base, what that meant, 

295
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,850
it was saying look at our dynamics and it's the point you get to when you wait pi halves 

296
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,760
units of time.

297
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,467
So the effect of raising to the i changes our dynamics in such a way that 

298
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:32,480
instead of walking around a circle we're doing this kind of exponential decay.

299
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,400
We're moving towards zero at a slowing and slowing rate and the place that you end 

300
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,160
up after pi halves units of time will be e to the negative pi halves around 0.2079.

301
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,679
So, you know, that's a little bit of intuition for in what sense do 

302
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,020
two 90 degree rotations combine to get you this very specific value.

303
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,081
One of them changes your dynamics and the original 

304
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:00,020
one came from the idea of walking pi halves radians.

305
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,800
So I think that's kind of satisfying in its own way because 

306
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,360
otherwise when you look at the expression i to the i equals e to the negative pi halves, 

307
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,840
it's like what does any of this mean?

308
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,600
This doesn't correspond to any, you know, thing that might see in the real world.

309
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,221
But thinking through the intuitions actually have you thinking 

310
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,760
through things like what are the dynamics of circular motion?

311
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,660
What are the dynamics for exponential decay?

312
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,540
Things that come up in the real world all the time.

313
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,989
But there is a potentially more pressing question 

314
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,980
which was raised and let's see if it's still up there.

315
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,147
Well, whoever asked it a little bit earlier, what 

316
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:33,440
about other solutions to e to the x equals i?

317
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,622
I think that's that's actually spot on and in fact, 

318
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:40,100
let me let me ask other people to contribute some solutions here.

319
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,200
So let's let's go to our quiz.

320
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,929
Let me go to question number three, which is going to be very similar to 

321
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:53,289
a question that was already seen, which is to write a value of x other than 

322
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,580
the one we just saw x equals pi halves times i so that e to the x equals i.

323
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,476
And feel free to be as creative as you want to try to 

324
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:04,100
get an answer that other people haven't written, right?

325
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,077
Um just to really emphasize that there are actually quite a 

326
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:10,004
few different options here and then in a moment we'll talk 

327
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:13,280
about why there are quite a few options if it's not already clear.

328
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,802
But I'll give you a moment to think of which of the many possible values of 

329
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:20,184
x you could choose is the one that you want to put your fingerprint on that 

330
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:23,700
you want to be contributing to the live stats page that we're seeing right now.

331
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,120
I'll give you a little moment.

332
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,480
So, and as you're answering that we've got a question coming in 

333
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,090
that says wouldn't it be more accurate to say that i to the power 

334
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,700
i is i different 90 degree rotations, not two 90 degree rotations.

335
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,820
After all it's multiplying by i that's the rotation.

336
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,600
So if we stretch the meaning of words too thin, aren't we multiplying by i i times?

337
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,380
I mean, I think the most honest answer here is just no not at all.

338
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,697
No offense meant but that's just not what exponentiation actually 

339
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,740
means as soon as we're extending to the idea of complex numbers.

340
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,520
I get the intent you kind of want to stretch the meaning of taking i to the i.

341
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,240
It's as if you're multiplying by itself i different times.

342
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,100
But I cannot think of a way that that actually like satisfactorily makes sense in my mind.

343
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:33,100
What I do think makes some sense is to try to think of the function i to the x.

344
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,120
Say what properties do we want this function to have?

345
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,685
And in the context of counting numbers, you know, 

346
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:44,813
if n and k are just things like 3 and 5, we know that it should 

347
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:49,780
satisfy this idea of multiplying the outputs correspond to adding the inputs.

348
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,455
So we want to say if this is any kind of function, and I, you know, 

349
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:56,606
I've said this in many different forms in many different places, 

350
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:00,920
we want it to satisfy the property that when you add the inputs you multiply the outputs.

351
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,772
That to me is kind of what exponentiation is more so than 

352
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:07,820
trying to stretch the idea of repeated multiplication.

353
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,632
So, it like, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, if you can definitely, 

354
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:18,674
if you can find some way where if you read this off in a stretching language context 

355
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:23,301
saying we're taking a 90 degree rotation and applying that i different times, 

356
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:28,402
that's not nonsense and that somehow like intuitively gets you to the answer e to the 

357
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:30,360
negative pi halves, I'm all ears.

358
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,768
But I think the healthier relationship to have is to say we have this central property 

359
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:40,740
for exponentiation, which definitely holds in the context of repeated multiplication.

360
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,718
But to extend beyond the places where repeated multiplication makes any sense, 

361
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:48,676
because it just it just doesn't make sense when we're talking about something that's 

362
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:52,680
not a counting number like i, or other crazy things that we exponentiate in math like 

363
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,100
matrices.

364
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:58,123
Focus on the property more so than what some people think of as 

365
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:01,540
the origins of that property or the original intuition behind it.

366
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,512
And an interesting question will be, you know, 

367
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:08,780
is there just one such function that feels reasonable to write for this?

368
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,707
Because, you know, if we're going to write it as i to the x not only should it 

369
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:18,898
satisfy this, it should also satisfy, you know, when we plug in the number one we get i, 

370
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:23,740
presumably i to the power one, however we're thinking of this function should be i.

371
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,880
Is there just one such function or are there multiple such functions?

372
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,045
That's what the quiz question is starting to get at and we've 

373
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:32,220
got lots of different answers, which always makes me happy.

374
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,440
So let's see some of the variety that people have thrown in here.

375
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,220
So we've got five pi i halves.

376
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,920
Great, that absolutely is another value that we could plug in for x here.

377
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,321
And just to spell out that a little bit more visually, 

378
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:52,559
if we were to look back at our circle here where we've at the moment walked for an amount 

379
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,739
of time equal to pi halves, which is 1.57, what if instead we took another full turn and 

380
00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:02,511
we go another pi halves to get us to pi, which you know, we might kind of record, 

381
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,840
that's where the e to the pi i value is.

382
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,703
We walk another pi halves, we walk another pi halves, 

383
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:13,300
which at this point we would have gone a full circle getting us back to one, 

384
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,420
and then we walk for five pi halves, which numerically is about 7.85.

385
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah, that absolutely is another number that gets us on top of i.

386
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,763
And if we were to go through the whole rigmarole of re-expressing i 

387
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:33,795
to the power i by first writing e to the five pi halves i to the power i, 

388
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:39,501
those i's multiply to become negative and we'd be looking at e to the 

389
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:44,800
negative five pi halves, which is a very different number, right?

390
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,240
We can actually calculate this.

391
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm not sure off the top of my head, but let's take a look at Desmos maybe.

392
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,240
Go over here.

393
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,220
Let's ask it.

394
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,340
What is e to the negative five pi halves?

395
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,800
0.000388.

396
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,900
Okay, 000388.

397
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,800
Much smaller number.

398
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,820
0.000388.

399
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,100
Which begs the question of okay i to the i, what are you?

400
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:12,780
Right?

401
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,220
Are you about a fifth like we saw before around 0.2?

402
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,200
Or are you this much smaller number?

403
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,776
And in terms of our intuition, it's basically a 

404
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:25,080
question of how we're interpreting that base i, right?

405
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,133
Are we thinking of it as you wait about 1.57 units of time and then you 

406
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:32,938
translate your dynamics into something that looks like decay rather than 

407
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:36,900
spinning and see where you decay to after that amount of time, which is 0.2.

408
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,560
Or do you wait even longer for about 7.85 units of time, which is five pi halves?

409
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,037
And see what happens when you decay for that long, 

410
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:46,980
which gets you to a much smaller number.

411
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,320
But that's not the only answer that we could enter, right?

412
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,540
We have other people coming in here with negative three halves times i pi.

413
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,287
Which, you know, in terms of a unit circle, we could think of as saying, 

414
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:05,948
hey if I want to get to i, rather than walking 90 degrees, 

415
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:11,400
pi halves radians that way, what if I walk 270 degrees the other way?

416
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,585
Three pi halves radians, which maybe I'll think of as negative 

417
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:17,420
because the convention is usually that counterclockwise is positive.

418
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,900
That absolutely is another way to express it.

419
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,380
And that would get us a different answer.

420
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,013
If we had e to the negative three pi halves i, 

421
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:28,520
all to the power i, we go through the same game.

422
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,946
Now the i squared cancels with the negative that's already there, 

423
00:26:32,946 --> 00:26:35,420
and we have a positive three pi halves.

424
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,958
And numerically this gets us an even different looking answer from what we had before, 

425
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:47,808
which if we go over and we say hey, what is e to the three pi, 

426
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:50,580
not three o, three pi halves 111.31.

427
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,160
Very different kind of number than what we saw before.

428
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,340
111 point, what was it?

429
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,760
111.31.

430
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:00,740
Great.

431
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,180
111.31 or so.

432
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,773
And again in terms of the intuition, what you might be asking there is, 

433
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:11,140
suppose we have this rotating dynamic, but we move backwards in time.

434
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,703
We see how long ago in time would I have to be, 

435
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:17,893
such that if I played things forward from there, I would land on the number one, 

436
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:18,980
my initial condition.

437
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,140
And you have to go back in time three pi halves units.

438
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,586
And then if you were to translate to the decay dynamics, 

439
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:28,553
which is what raising to the i is doing in this context, 

440
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:32,717
you say if I'm starting at the number one, but I want to move backwards in time 

441
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,985
and say where should I have started if I want to decay down such that I end up at 

442
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:39,640
the number one after three pi halves units of time?

443
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,400
The answer is evidently starting at around 111 for that kind of exponential decay.

444
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,823
And you can see where this is going, where there's actually infinitely many different 

445
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:52,400
values that we could plug in for x if we're thinking of e to the x as being i.

446
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,340
And people have entered a lot more here.

447
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
Excuse me, throwing my pen onto the ground as one does.

448
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,600
Classic for third place.

449
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,740
Nine pi halves, great choice.

450
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,680
1729 pi halves, y'all are my favorite.

451
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,521
Lots and lots of different options, infinitely many different values, 

452
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,840
which feels a little disconcerting at first, right?

453
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,036
Because we look at an expression that seems like, 

454
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,320
you know, there's just going to be some computation.

455
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,900
I just plug that into my calculator and see what pops out.

456
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,540
And we've got multiple different values for it.

457
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,300
So what's going on here, right?

458
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,400
What's going on?

459
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,648
And I think this really cuts to the idea of how we think about exponentials in general, 

460
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:30,980
right?

461
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,752
But before that I do want to emphasize that this isn't the only time in math 

462
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:38,520
where we come across a kind of ambiguity for how to interpret something, right?

463
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,280
Because if I say something like, what is the square root of 25?

464
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,500
You know, I think a lot of us say, well, it's five.

465
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,460
But if we are saying, you know, what should the square root be?

466
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,740
It should be some number x such that when you square it you get 25.

467
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,300
Well, there's two different answers to that.

468
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,757
Who's to say that our conventions should be that the square root function is positive, 

469
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:04,180
gives us a positive number rather than negative five.

470
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,426
So we have one expression that seems like it wants to have multiple different values, 

471
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:08,700
right?

472
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,706
And this could actually happen in another context where instead of square roots, 

473
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:17,080
what if I was asking for the fourth root of something like 16?

474
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,380
Usually we would think of this as positive number two, right?

475
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,540
Two is a number such that when you multiply by itself four times you get 16.

476
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,360
Seems like a decent answer to a fourth root.

477
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,574
But if we're thinking of this as answering the question, 

478
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:32,820
what number to the fourth equals 16?

479
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,580
There is another answer to this.

480
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,220
We could also say negative two.

481
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,840
That's a number that when you multiply by itself four times you get 16.

482
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,320
But there's another answer.

483
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
You could say two times i.

484
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
That seems valid, but there's another answer.

485
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,160
You could think negative two times i.

486
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,780
All four of these numbers satisfy that property.

487
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,640
So who's to say that the fourth root of 16 should be two?

488
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,500
And the answer ends up being, well, we adopt a convention.

489
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,601
When there's multiple options like this, when you have a multi-valued function, 

490
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:09,117
we often just choose one of those values to be what we mean when we want to 

491
00:30:09,117 --> 00:30:12,680
treat it as a function, as something with a single input and a single output.

492
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,319
In fancier lingo, this comes up all the time when we're dealing with complex numbers, 

493
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,820
the idea of something as an operation kind of wanting to have multiple values.

494
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,773
You'll sometimes hear the phrase branch, where you choose a branch of 

495
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:28,720
the square root function, which is to say you choose a certain convention.

496
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,719
In real numbers, it's nice and easy sometimes 

497
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,440
because you say just choose the positive one.

498
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,203
But there's no notion of which complex numbers are like the 

499
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:38,920
positive complex numbers when we want to take square roots.

500
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,060
Just to give one example, let's say we wanted to take the square root of i.

501
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,740
And we want to know what should that be?

502
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,800
Because there's multiple different answers.

503
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,040
You know, we think of i again as this 90 degree rotation.

504
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,711
And if we were thinking of it as a 90 degree rotation, 

505
00:30:55,711 --> 00:31:01,260
it feels like the square root should be, you know, something sitting at a 45 degree angle.

506
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,075
Maybe that's the square root of i, which we could write 

507
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:08,600
out very explicitly as root 2 over 2, root 2 over 2 i.

508
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
That's just using trigonometry.

509
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,095
But if we were thinking of i instead as being a negative 270 degree rotation, 

510
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:19,765
it feels like half of that, doing half of that operation, 

511
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:22,360
should actually get us on the other side.

512
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Maybe the number sitting down here should be the square root of i.

513
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,760
And that's actually just the negative of what we saw before.

514
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,680
Negative root 2 over 2 minus root 2 over 2 times i.

515
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,072
Now in the context of real valued functions, we can say, yeah, 

516
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:41,040
just choose the square root to be whatever the positive answer is.

517
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,200
But which of these do you consider the positive answer?

518
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,087
You know, maybe it feels like we should consider this 

519
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:48,480
upper one because its coordinates have positive numbers.

520
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,274
But however you try to define positive in a nice way here that's going to be consistent, 

521
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:55,903
you know, for example, two positive numbers should always multiply to make a positive 

522
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:59,700
number, you're not really going to be able to do it the way that you can for real numbers.

523
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,307
And in fact, this phenomenon here where we're taking roots is 

524
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:07,796
actually the same as the phenomenon we were just looking at when 

525
00:32:07,796 --> 00:32:11,500
we were talking about multiple values for i raised to the power of i.

526
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,394
Because forget i raised to the power of i, let me ask what might 

527
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:19,260
look like a much simpler question of taking 2 to the power one half.

528
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,380
Okay, what's 2 to the one half?

529
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,260
Yeah, I think you say, well, we know what this is, 

530
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,980
we kind of define it to be the square root of 2, all is well and good.

531
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,095
But what if I said let's approach this the same way 

532
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:32,700
that we were approaching our i to the i expression?

533
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,524
I want to first express things as e to the something, right, 

534
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:41,351
and then I'm going to raise that to the one half by multiplying the one half 

535
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:42,480
into the exponent.

536
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,880
And I say, well, okay, I can, I guess I can do that.

537
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,960
e to the what is equal to 2?

538
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,780
Well, that's the natural log of 2.

539
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,640
It's a constant which is around 0.69 or so.

540
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,820
If we raise e to that power, we'll get 2.

541
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,240
So we could be thinking of this as e to the natural log of 2 times one half.

542
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,629
And if you wanted to, if you were thinking of e to the x, you know, 

543
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:12,844
this might be kind of overkill in the context of real numbers, 

544
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:17,727
but if you were thinking of e to the x as shorthand for this x function, 

545
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:23,681
you could plug in the value 0.69 times one half, which I guess would be around 0.345ish, 

546
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:25,020
something like that.

547
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,475
You plug in that very concrete value into your polynomial, 

548
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:31,220
see what it outputs, and it will output around 1.415.

549
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,480
So that's a nice real number.

550
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,040
Square root of 2, what you would expect.

551
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,264
But if we do the same thing we were just doing with i and 

552
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:41,984
acknowledging that there's actually multiple different answers 

553
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:45,180
when we want to write something as e to a power, we could also write this.

554
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:53,140
This might seem funny, but we could write it as e to the natural log of 2 plus 2 pi i.

555
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,560
That whole thing raised to the one half.

556
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:58,040
Right?

557
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,320
After all, this value will come to equal 2.

558
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,460
You could break it down as it's e to the natural log of 2 multiplied by e to the 2 pi i.

559
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,520
This one just has the effect of rotating things 360 degrees.

560
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,719
So it's just going to equal 1, so we're looking at 2 times 1.

561
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,880
Great, that feels like a valid substitution.

562
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,256
And yet when we play the same game of taking this and raising it to a power and 

563
00:34:22,256 --> 00:34:26,380
treating that by multiplying the power into the exponent, look at what happens.

564
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:34,880
We have e to the natural log of 2 times one half plus Well, what's 2 pi i times one half?

565
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,239
Well, that will be pi times i.

566
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:41,501
Now this first part, e to the natural log of 2 times one half, 

567
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:44,699
that will end up being the familiar square root of 2.

568
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,320
That's all well and good.

569
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,140
But we're going to be multiplying that by e to the pi i.

570
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,600
Right?

571
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,100
And quite famously e to the pi i is negative 1.

572
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,163
So in this case, it seems to be suggesting that if we are solving this expression 

573
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:05,453
2 to the one half by playing around with the different answers we could plug in for 

574
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:10,680
something like e to the x equaling one half, what we end up with is another answer.

575
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,260
What we might traditionally write as this negative square root of 2.

576
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,400
And here, I mean it's a little funny for it to have multiple values 

577
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,800
to look at 2 to the one half and say that's not equaling one thing, 

578
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,300
but based on choices we make it could equal multiple different things.

579
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
But the two things that it could seem quite reasonable.

580
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,333
If there's going to be anything that 2 to the one half is, 

581
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,863
it seems like it should either be the positive square root that we're familiar with or 

582
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:35,040
the negative variant of that.

583
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,880
That doesn't actually seem like such a problem.

584
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,309
And in fact, we could we could play this game even further, 

585
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:45,840
where let me ask you for even more creative answers to this expression.

586
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,578
Because maybe we can find other funny powers of something like 2 to the power x as 

587
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:55,240
we start plugging in various different values of x based on what substitution we make.

588
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,320
If we're abiding by the same rules that we were using in evaluating i to the power i.

589
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,563
So this time the question asks or it specifies that one solution of 

590
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:08,180
the equation e to the x equals 2 is the real number natural log of 2.

591
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,580
Okay, that one we know it.

592
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,100
It's not boring, but it's boring in comparison to what else we could do.

593
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,180
Can you think of another one?

594
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,400
Can you write some other answer to the question e to the x equals 2?

595
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,840
And again, creativity is welcomed.

596
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,980
So I will give you another little moment for that.

597
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:56,740
All right, I will go ahead and lock in some answers here if that's all right with you.

598
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,916
I'm not sure how much time it necessarily takes to do 

599
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,340
the math entry depending on what device you're looking at.

600
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,460
But don't be too stressed if it's before you got the chance to enter 

601
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,180
the question that you want into the answer that you wanted to answer.

602
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,211
So it looks like 131 of you have entered the variant 

603
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:19,360
where we take ln of 2 and we add 2 pi i.

604
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,066
And I guess I in writing this question mistakenly like marked one of the 

605
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:26,780
answers as being correct when in fact there's quite a few different correct ones.

606
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,173
So that's on me for the fact that I don't know if it looks to any of you like, 

607
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:34,024
oh, it's red you got it wrong when you entered ln of 2 plus 

608
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:36,020
42 i pi which is of course a great choice.

609
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,100
But you could also have something like 4 pi i plus the natural log of 2 or 6 pi i.

610
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:48,600
Or really any integer multiple of 2 pi i if you add that it doesn't affect e to the x.

611
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,420
Because it just has the effect of multiplying by e 

612
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,940
to the 2 pi i which is the effect of multiplying by 1.

613
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,680
And again, this has kind of a funny consequence where it 

614
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,800
seems to output kind of reasonable results when we do it.

615
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,320
As another example, it looks like the second most common 

616
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,240
entered expression there was that we might replace 2.

617
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,980
So let's think we're thinking of 2 to the power of one fourth.

618
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:10,800
Okay.

619
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,280
There was a suggestion that we replace 2 with e to the natural log of 2 plus 4 pi i.

620
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,720
Okay.

621
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,260
Plus 4 pi i.

622
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,460
And we raise all of that to the one fourth, right?

623
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,344
Well if you were to play the same game you would get e to the natural 

624
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:36,560
log of 2 times one fourth and we'd be multiplying by e to the pi i.

625
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,280
Now the first part of that is going to be the usual positive fourth root of 2.

626
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,630
The thing we mean when you plug in an expression like fourth root of 2 into a calculator, 

627
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,000
a nice small positive number.

628
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,460
But then this second part is negative 1.

629
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,288
So it seems to be saying, you know, if we were to interpret 2 in this different way, 

630
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:58,539
raising it to the one fourth, you know, it's not the usual answer 

631
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,560
that we get but it's a reasonable answer.

632
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,560
It's another number that when you raise it to the fourth power you get 2.

633
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,864
And if we had done this with even different values, if instead we had been using 2 pi i, 

634
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:13,640
you know, it's kind of fun to think about how that would have changed things.

635
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,964
If instead of 4 pi i we had been adding 2 pi i, 

636
00:39:16,964 --> 00:39:21,080
well then over here we would have been looking at pi halves times i.

637
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,900
And instead of multiplying by negative 1 we would have instead been multiplying by i.

638
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,340
Which again is a valid answer.

639
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,540
It seems like a reasonable output for something like 2 to the one fourth.

640
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:37,623
So when you're looking at the fact that i to the power i seems to have multiple different 

641
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:42,538
values for it, right, we have this funny phenomenon where we can plug in e to the 5 pi 

642
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:47,340
halves i, negative 3 pi halves i, and we get what seem like wildly different answers.

643
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,802
Something super small, something super big, all very different from the one fifth, 

644
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:54,840
approximately one fifth answer that we found before up here.

645
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,515
It's exactly the same phenomenon as when you're asking something like 

646
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:01,612
what's 2 to the one fourth and acknowledging that there's actually 

647
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:04,940
multiple different solutions to the expression x to the fourth equals 2.

648
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,900
Four different solutions in fact.

649
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,905
And what you're looking at is the fact that there's multiple different 

650
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:14,133
solutions to the expression e to the x equals some kind of base, 

651
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:17,560
whether that base is i, whether that base is 2, whatever it might be.

652
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,390
And one way that we might think about this is that when 

653
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,400
you're dealing with real numbers things are just lovely.

654
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,780
Things are nice.

655
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,480
There's one-to-one relationships.

656
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,500
You've got positives.

657
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,580
It's great.

658
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,948
Where if we want to think about exponential functions, 

659
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:36,180
let me just cover some of this stuff up.

660
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,438
We have this nice back and forth where you can choose to express any 

661
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:47,006
exponential as a base to x like 2 to the x or you could express that same 

662
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:51,573
exponential as x of r times x which you know, that is the polynomial that 

663
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:56,820
we refer to whenever implicitly refer to whenever we write something like e to the x.

664
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,648
And there's a lovely back and forth because you can just take a natural 

665
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:04,280
logarithm of b and it gives you one answer assuming that b is a positive number.

666
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,080
And that's the same thing as saying that x of r is equal to b.

667
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,284
So one way that I've talked about this earlier in the series is 

668
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:16,105
that if you were looking at the family of all possible exponentials, 

669
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:19,760
right, we could write them as x of r times x and change what r is.

670
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,410
And this is exactly the same thing as writing e to the r 

671
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,800
times x if that's something you're more comfortable with.

672
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,580
So e to the r times x x of r times x those are the same thing.

673
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,439
We could think about changing what that is.

674
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,380
But on the other hand if you were to think about all possible exponentials as some base, 

675
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,500
let me do base to the power of x and we're going to change what that base is.

676
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,028
At first it feels like that's a different kind of expression to 

677
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:46,780
manipulate but it's just another way of expressing the same family.

678
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,465
Right, and a way that you might think about this for how do we think about what base 

679
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:57,560
does it correspond to if we're thinking a little bit more abstractly as exp of r times x.

680
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,341
And there's a reason I'm doing this because we're about to 

681
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:01,180
apply this to complex numbers where it's going to look weirder.

682
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,580
So follow through with me here.

683
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,014
If instead of looking at that base, one thing I could do is say what is the 

684
00:42:08,014 --> 00:42:13,640
value of exp of r, right, which is basically this function of when we plug in one.

685
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,520
So exp of r times one if you prefer to think of it that way.

686
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,560
And that is being represented by our green line.

687
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,151
And what you can see is okay if I get r that a factor in front of x in my exponential 

688
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:33,840
function exp of r x to be 0.69, which I know is around the natural log of two.

689
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,860
What this means is that exp of one is about two.

690
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,643
And so this corresponds with the function that 

691
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,620
we would usually write as two to the power x.

692
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:43,620
Right.

693
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,710
Okay, and basically as I change around my r, you know, 

694
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,180
I could try to change it to something so that it looks like three.

695
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,088
So around 1.1 that exponential looks like three, 

696
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:57,040
which we would usually write as three to the power x.

697
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,458
I would like to argue that it's a little bit healthier to 

698
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,600
think about varying this value r rather than varying the base.

699
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,629
And the main reason is that as soon as we get to complex contexts and we're 

700
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:13,153
thinking of exponentiation, you have this overloading that goes on where 

701
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:17,740
if we change around what sits in front of the x, that's all well and good.

702
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,100
I could have exp of r times x where maybe r is something like 0.69.

703
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,120
But I could shift that down by 2 pi i.

704
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,380
And that doesn't change the base that it would correspond to.

705
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,820
That would still correspond to two.

706
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,820
Or it could shift it up by 2 pi i.

707
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,840
That doesn't change the base that it corresponds to.

708
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,020
Because in all of those cases when we plug in x equals one, we get the same thing.

709
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,620
However, all of these for different values of x are distinct functions.

710
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,580
This is why we saw multiple different values for i to the power i.

711
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,880
Because i to the x is an ambiguous function in that context.

712
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,770
It would be unambiguous if we decided which value of r such that what 

713
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,520
we're representing is exp of r times x, which value of r do we choose?

714
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,160
As soon as we choose one, it's an unambiguous function.

715
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,508
But at that point it just feels like maybe what we want is to stop 

716
00:44:06,508 --> 00:44:10,240
thinking about things in terms of some base raised to the power x.

717
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,589
Maybe as soon as we're in the context of complex numbers, 

718
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:16,700
we should just write them all as exp of some constant times x.

719
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,624
If for no other reason, it makes crystal clear how we actually plug in 

720
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:24,260
numbers if we want to do a computation, or just to do math on top of it.

721
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,040
We've got this nice infinite polynomial that we plug them into.

722
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:33,069
And I'll make another case for you that this is maybe the the correct way to think about 

723
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:37,920
exponentials, as soon as we're extending into other domains, things like complex numbers.

724
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,780
And for that, let's just let's just back up.

725
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,600
Go back.

726
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,600
Oh doorbell, something's arrived.

727
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,057
Go back to the original way that we extend the idea of 

728
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:51,980
exponentiation and just think of like what is two to the x?

729
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,280
Right.

730
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,757
We know how to think about this for natural numbers, 

731
00:44:56,757 --> 00:45:00,540
you know something like two to the three, repeated multiplication.

732
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,344
How is it that you're first taught to think about something like two to 

733
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:07,700
the x for fractional amounts or for negative amounts and things like that?

734
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,447
Well, you're usually taught that two to the one half should be something where you know 

735
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:18,556
if I multiply it by itself and this follows the usual rules that exponentials do with 

736
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:22,476
counting numbers where we're able to add things in that exponent, 

737
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:24,140
I should get two to the one.

738
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,380
So it should be some number that when I multiply it by itself, I get two.

739
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:30,940
And you know at that point you have a choice.

740
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,680
Maybe it's positive.

741
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,460
Maybe it's negative.

742
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,659
But if you always decide to make the positive choice, 

743
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:38,200
you're going to be able to get a nice continuous function out of this.

744
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,840
Same deal if we ask about negative numbers, what should two to the negative one be?

745
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,768
Well, that should be something where when I multiply it by two to the one, 

746
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:46,960
it gets me two to the zero.

747
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,284
And that's kind of the justification for our convention 

748
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:52,500
that negative exponents look like one half.

749
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,711
But what's really going on here is we're saying whatever this is, 

750
00:45:57,711 --> 00:46:03,806
it should be some kind of function that satisfies this property f of a plus b equals 

751
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:05,240
f of a times f of b.

752
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,523
And moreover the fact that the base is two is basically 

753
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:12,080
telling us that it's not just any such function.

754
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,440
It's a function where when we plug in one we get two.

755
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,443
And just as a little, you know, sanity check style question to 

756
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,480
see if you're following along with some of the implications here.

757
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,458
I want to ask you what is, I won't call it like a softball, but this is, 

758
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:33,320
this isn't meant to be like an incredibly deep question necessarily.

759
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,688
It's just more of a check if you're following along with the idea of 

760
00:46:36,688 --> 00:46:39,842
abstractly starting with properties of a function and then kind of 

761
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:43,420
deducing ways that we might want to write it down based on those properties.

762
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,388
If f of x satisfies this exponential property f of a plus b equals f of a times f of b 

763
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:54,900
for all inputs, and it also satisfies f of one equals two, which of the following is true?

764
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,437
Which is to say which of the following is necessarily 

765
00:46:58,437 --> 00:47:01,380
true no matter which such function you're starting with.

766
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,580
And those of you who remember which lecture was it?

767
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,420
It's whichever one we were talking about how to 

768
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,180
interpret what Euler's formula is really saying.

769
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,185
I asked a question of this style where I neglected a single condition, 

770
00:47:12,185 --> 00:47:15,838
you know, I didn't write down the fact that we want to make sure f of 

771
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,700
x is non-zero everywhere and then that caused some amount of confutlement.

772
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,160
Which is cool, get confutlement on screen that happens to all of us.

773
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,548
But the the intent of it was to basically show that this abstract property of 

774
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:33,962
something that turns addition into multiplication is uh is enough to basically make 

775
00:47:33,962 --> 00:47:39,700
you want to write the function as whatever it equals as one raised to some kind of power.

776
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,980
This is the the spirit of the question.

777
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:47,455
Um Now we've got a couple questions actually about power towers that 

778
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:52,180
seem to have popped up here, which is great connected to last time.

779
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,073
Um, let's let's hold off on the power tower question for just a moment, 

780
00:47:57,073 --> 00:48:02,260
so that we first get like a deeper feel of like what exponentiation should mean here.

781
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,927
Um, because because we can be what I want to claim 

782
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,260
is we can answer it in like multiple different ways.

783
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,880
So if you give me just a moment, we'll talk about power towers.

784
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,258
Uh, and then just as a number line can be represented in a logarithmic scale, 

785
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,560
can the same be done for a complex plane?

786
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,560
Maybe mapping the complex plane onto an infinite cylinder in the logarithmic sense.

787
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,160
Yeah.

788
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,266
Yeah, uh, in fact, there's a visualization that I'm going to get to 

789
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:29,020
in just a moment here where we do something quite similar to that.

790
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,037
Because what we'll do is play around with different exponential functions x of r times x, 

791
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:37,382
but we're going to change that value of r which is going to be 

792
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,240
represented by a little yellow dot.

793
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
So we'll kind of talk through this.

794
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,200
It's not going to map the whole plane, but just a couple 

795
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,540
sample points from the real axis and the imaginary axis.

796
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,011
But the idea is that as we move around what that constant is, 

797
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:52,725
we're going to be able to kind of visualize the different things that um, 

798
00:48:52,725 --> 00:48:53,780
it does to the plane.

799
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,036
And effectively, it's like it's turning the x-axis into a 

800
00:48:57,036 --> 00:49:00,460
logarithmic scale and then wrapping the imaginary axis along a circle.

801
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,700
And then as soon as that value of r becomes imaginary, it swaps the role of those.

802
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,582
Real numbers get put on the circle and imaginary 

803
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:10,760
numbers get put on a logarithmic scaled positive axis.

804
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,140
So great question.

805
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,675
All three of which I guess are sort of jumping the gun ahead for where I want to go, 

806
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:17,460
but nice to see that's where people are thinking.

807
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,000
So on this one, let's go ahead and just grade it.

808
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,853
The idea is that this property of f of a plus b ends up letting you 

809
00:49:25,853 --> 00:49:31,220
express a lot of different things purely in terms of what f of one is.

810
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,553
And just to spell that out very explicitly, something like f of five is the 

811
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:42,254
same thing as f of one plus one plus one plus one plus one, 

812
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:48,208
which is the same thing as f of one multiplied by itself five times because 

813
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,540
of this property.

814
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,520
Which if f of one is two is the same as two to the power five.

815
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,869
And then something like f of negative five, it should be the case 

816
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:04,680
that when we multiply it by f of five, we get whatever f of zero is.

817
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,723
And it's not immediately clear what f of zero is, 

818
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:14,293
but we could say that f of one plus zero is equal to whatever f of one is 

819
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:16,100
times what f of zero is.

820
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,160
But f of one is equal to two, and so this is also equal to two.

821
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,320
So we're saying two is equal to two times something.

822
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,740
Well that something has to be a one.

823
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,960
So in this context this guarantees that f of negative five is two to the negative five.

824
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,560
It's one over two to the fifth.

825
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,440
So we could explicitly write this as two to the negative five.

826
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:40,061
Which is all to say, these two properties together make us really want to write 

827
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:44,873
the function as two to the x, because any counting number that we put in, 

828
00:50:44,873 --> 00:50:50,334
it's going to satisfy, it's going to look like two multiplied by itself that number 

829
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:50,920
of times.

830
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,820
Any fractional number we put in, it's going to satisfy these properties that we wanted.

831
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,400
And you might wonder, is that unique?

832
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,020
And in the context of real valued functions, it actually would be.

833
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,739
But in the context of complex valued functions, 

834
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:06,860
there would be multiple such functions f that we could write for this.

835
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,681
One of which is what we were looking at before, 

836
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:19,284
where we could have a function defined to be exp of the natural log of two plus 

837
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,040
two pi i all of that times x.

838
00:51:24,899 --> 00:51:26,480
Okay, forgive the sloppiness here.

839
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,200
I just get excited writing about this.

840
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,480
And this is actually a different function, as evidenced 

841
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,720
by what happens if you plug in x equals one half.

842
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,822
Right, we saw a little bit earlier how when you plug in one half, 

843
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:38,380
what you get is the negative square root of two.

844
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,814
And then if you plug in one fourth, you get not the fourth root of two, 

845
00:51:42,814 --> 00:51:44,600
but i times the fourth root of two.

846
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,002
So it is a different function, but it still satisfies these properties, 

847
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:50,680
and it kind of makes us want to write it as two to the x.

848
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,877
And it makes it suggest that maybe two to the x is an ambiguous bit of notation, 

849
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:58,660
and we should just write everything in terms of exp of r times something.

850
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,135
But you might wonder, well, you know, maybe we're just not being 

851
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:05,060
creative enough with all of the functions that satisfy this property.

852
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,816
Maybe there's an ambiguity when we write exp of r times something, 

853
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:10,160
and there's different values of r that could come into play.

854
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,120
Um, but I'm just going to put down a little claim, 

855
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,933
and then maybe give like a sketch of what the proof would look like if you want, 

856
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,663
which is that let's say you have some complex function f, 

857
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:21,640
and it satisfies the following properties.

858
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,200
First, you're able to take a derivative of it.

859
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,260
It's differentiable, which just keeps it from being some, uh, you know, 

860
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,107
totally messy discontinuous thing that's like taking on some random values depending on, 

861
00:52:33,107 --> 00:52:36,592
you know, the span of whatever vector space over, I don't know, 

862
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:39,860
fractional amounts you might want to think of in crazy ways.

863
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,700
It's a nice function that's differentiable.

864
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,900
It's not equal to zero everywhere.

865
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,454
So the condition that sort of slipped my mind and I forget which lecture, 

866
00:52:48,454 --> 00:52:50,320
lecture four or something like that.

867
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,380
And then it has this central property that it turns addition into multiplication.

868
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,627
If you have such a function, I claim that there's a unique, 

869
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:05,800
maybe I should really specify, there exists a unique complex number r so that 

870
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,576
you could write f of x as basically being this exponential function of r 

871
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:13,080
times that value x.

872
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,514
Which is, you know, basically saying that if you have exp as a function, 

873
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:21,463
this infinite polynomial with nice derivative properties and all of that, 

874
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:25,838
if you have this you have every exponential that you want in a very like abstract 

875
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:30,640
generic sense of the word exponential just based on a property that we could want from it.

876
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,520
And the sketch of the proof would look something like this.

877
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,471
If you want to first look at what is the derivative of this value, 

878
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:39,580
which we're assuming exists everywhere, right?

879
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,540
And you explicitly write out what the limit of that is.

880
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,006
I'll just talk through it very quickly here for those who 

881
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:47,100
want to like pause and think through the details, feel free to.

882
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:53,560
The central property that we have lets us expand out the f of x plus h term.

883
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,048
So we're thinking, you know, a change, slight change to 

884
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:58,080
the output over the change to the input that caused it.

885
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,720
That's what df dx unwraps to.

886
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,722
And because we can factor that out, we can factor f of x out of the 

887
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:10,320
expression entirely and the whole limit is expressed only in terms of h.

888
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:15,418
Which if you think about what it means in the context of derivatives and the fact 

889
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,991
that f of zero necessarily equals one, this whole limiting expression is just some 

890
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:24,840
constant, but more specifically it's whatever the derivative of our function at zero is.

891
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,665
So you have this funny thing where if you know its derivative 

892
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,860
at zero that determines what its derivative is everywhere.

893
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,057
And in the context of exponential functions this is hopefully quite familiar because all 

894
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:39,654
that we're really saying is the derivative of an exponential function is proportional to 

895
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:44,200
itself and that proportionality constant is equal to whatever the derivative at zero is.

896
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,258
This is all very abstractly phrased and such, but the purpose of it is to 

897
00:54:48,258 --> 00:54:52,139
emphasize that it's not necessarily just functions that we already think of 

898
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:56,224
as a to the power x, but it is a potentially much more broad class of functions 

899
00:54:56,224 --> 00:55:00,360
that just satisfy this abstract property of turning addition into multiplication.

900
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,380
But if you have that, it actually guarantees that you also have a second derivative.

901
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,681
And for that matter a third derivative and such because 

902
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:11,060
the derivative function is just proportional to itself.

903
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,281
So in order to take the nth derivative you just look at 

904
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:18,700
that proportionality constant and raise it to the power n.

905
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,205
And then from here you could do a Taylor series expansion and I might leave that as sort 

906
00:55:24,205 --> 00:55:29,205
of the advanced homework for those of you who are comfortable with Taylor series and that 

907
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:34,039
idea especially if you want to intermix the idea of any differentiable function that's 

908
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:39,040
differentiable in a sense of complex numbers, which is sort of a definitely college topic.

909
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,454
You know, you could intermix the reasoning there as you want, 

910
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:49,052
but fuzzy reasoning is allowed in the context of someone who only knows about Taylor 

911
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:53,921
series and nothing else to take this idea and look at the Taylor expansion for f and kind 

912
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:58,574
of justify the idea that there's a unique complex number such that our function f can 

913
00:55:58,574 --> 00:56:00,360
necessarily be written like this.

914
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,580
And then the connection to normal exponentials is whenever you have such 

915
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,586
a value r we do essentially what we do in the complex context of real 

916
00:56:10,586 --> 00:56:15,664
numbers is if you look at x of that function of that value r and write 

917
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:21,100
that as a base it feels like you should be able to write that as b to the x.

918
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,689
But the whole the whole point here of course is that when we play this game and 

919
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:31,701
you're trying to interpret something like i to the x that's an ambiguous function 

920
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:36,468
because there's lots of different values of r we could interpret that to mean 

921
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:41,296
not just exp of pi halves i times x but we could also interpret it to mean exp 

922
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:45,941
of five pi halves i times x and these are separate functions and there's an 

923
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:51,320
infinite family of separate functions that feel like we should write them as i to the x.

924
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,896
So the expression i to the i unless you've adopted a standard for what that's necessarily 

925
00:56:55,896 --> 00:57:00,049
going to mean when you say it has infinitely many outputs another way to think of that 

926
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:04,060
is that the function i to the x with the notation we have is a little bit ambiguous.

927
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,029
Now with all of that, let's let's just start visualizing 

928
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:08,720
some of this because I think that's fun.

929
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,948
And you know, you you tell me if this is if this is a helpful visual or a more 

930
00:57:14,948 --> 00:57:20,017
confusing visual but what we're going to do is look at this function exp of 

931
00:57:20,017 --> 00:57:25,220
r times x which is basically this is another way to write e to the power of x.

932
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,068
In fact, I think I I think I rendered a different animation at some 

933
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:32,960
point that specified that because I was planning on planning on doing that.

934
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,266
So let me oh, yeah, there you are get back in my 

935
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:37,460
file system get back to where you're supposed to be.

936
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,360
Get on in there is it complaining because there's multiple different?

937
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,200
It's going to be like there's a oh replace it shows up on the other screen.

938
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,900
Wait, why is it?

939
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,919
Yeah, okay replace place whatever you see there.

940
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,178
And now we go back to oh there we go all of that all of that just so that I could have 

941
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:06,963
nicely written out uh, if you're uncomfortable with thinking of it as exp of r times 

942
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:11,805
x this infinite polynomial Just in the back of your head e to the r times x and we're 

943
00:58:11,805 --> 00:58:16,478
going to vary around r So i'm going to follow the points of the imaginary axis and 

944
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:21,376
i'm going to follow the points of the real axis And uh, let's see what this does Well, 

945
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:26,049
that's all kind of fast so let me think through it a little bit more slowly all of 

946
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:30,834
the negative numbers Anything that's a negative real number is going to get squished 

947
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:35,620
into the range between zero and one which should make sense e to the negative e to a 

948
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:40,518
negative real number is something between zero and one and we're Specifically tracking 

949
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:45,359
f of negative one which is going to show up around whatever one over e is around zero 

950
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,089
point three seven f of one lands on e As expected that's what x of one is f of i Is 

951
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:54,874
going to land one radian around the unit circle and it's kind of fun to follow along 

952
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:59,660
the whole imaginary axis here How the imaginary axis gets uh wrapped around a circle?

953
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,634
And what happens as we tweak this value of r that's determining not just that we're 

954
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:10,469
talking about an exponential function But which exponential function there's a nice 

955
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:15,188
one-to-one correspondence between all the exponential functions we might want and 

956
00:59:15,188 --> 00:59:20,138
values of r here It stretches things differently So when we put it up to two You know 

957
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:24,857
it stretches out the real axis a lot more so that f of one ends up around where e 

958
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:29,749
squared is a little Above seven f of negative one is much closer to zero f of i Is a 

959
00:59:29,749 --> 00:59:34,814
two radian rotation around the circle f of negative i is a negative two radian rotation 

960
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:39,706
And of course we can get to our favorite formula that If that were pi that we had as 

961
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:44,598
our scaling constant then the real axis gets stretched out quite a lot you know f of 

962
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:49,433
one is sitting off at e to the pi which is very close to 20 plus pi which is always 

963
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:54,267
fun and f of negative one extremely close to zero so It's really stretched out that 

964
00:59:54,267 --> 00:59:58,987
real axis and it's also stretched out things in the Unit circle direction so that 

965
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:03,764
getting to f of i or f of negative i walks halfway around the circle So that's all 

966
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:04,800
well and good now.

967
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,200
How would we think about a function like?

968
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,820
two to the x Which is what?

969
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,257
We would also write as exp of Exp of the natural log of two times x So we 

970
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:20,186
kind of move our yellow dot representing the value of r to around zero point 

971
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:25,180
six nine still no imaginary part Just a real number zero point six nine or so.

972
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,820
That's the natural log of two Well, you can see that f of one lands on two, 

973
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:34,557
which is why we want to call this function two to the x f of one half actually, 

974
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:39,650
sorry f of negative one lands right on one half f of i It's some walk around the unit 

975
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:44,742
circle very specifically it's going to be 0.69 radians around the unit circle And now 

976
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:49,953
we could have a little bit more fun and say what would happen if we were to Change this 

977
01:00:49,953 --> 01:00:54,987
to instead of being 0.69 instead of being the natural log of two make it i times the 

978
01:00:54,987 --> 01:00:59,783
natural log of two So that we're really thinking of something that might have an 

979
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:04,935
exponential base to it This would be what we might think of as two times i Raised to a 

980
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:10,146
power Well, if we move that yellow dot which is representing r off of the real axis and 

981
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:15,298
onto the imaginary axis it swaps the roles of the Teal dots and all of the maroon dots 

982
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:20,390
in this context which remember came from being the positive and imaginary axes And it 

983
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:25,424
should make sense that it swaps their roles because what does it mean if we take the 

984
01:01:25,424 --> 01:01:27,260
input space and we multiply it?

985
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,828
By i it means we're rotating that input space So everything that was the real number 

986
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:36,182
axis turns into the imaginary axis and everything that was the imaginary axis Is 

987
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:40,643
getting turned into the real axis So for us what that means is our new exponential 

988
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:45,158
function where our value of r is now purely imaginary Takes all of the real numbers 

989
01:01:45,158 --> 01:01:49,834
and it just wraps them around a circle and it takes all the imaginary numbers And it's 

990
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:52,897
putting them onto the real number line So in particular, 

991
01:01:52,897 --> 01:01:57,681
let's say we scale this thing up so that we're sitting at around pi halves times i Well, 

992
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:59,240
what does that actually mean?

993
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,106
That means it takes the real number one to the value i Which is the 

994
01:02:03,106 --> 01:02:07,200
sense in which we want to write this function as i to the power x Right.

995
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,434
It just tempts us to write it not as this abstract looking thing X of r 

996
01:02:11,434 --> 01:02:14,198
times x where r is equal to pi halves i no No, 

997
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:18,491
we just want to write it as i to the x even if that's a little ambiguous 

998
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:22,961
What that really means is just that the function we're dealing with outputs 

999
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:26,137
i at one and if it's an exponential function that Uh, 

1000
01:02:26,137 --> 01:02:28,960
and we're asking what does it do to the value i?

1001
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,800
What is i to the power i?

1002
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,424
In this case, it shoves it to around uh, 0.2 around a fifth But there's many 

1003
01:02:35,424 --> 01:02:39,603
different exponential functions that would have this property of putting f of 

1004
01:02:39,603 --> 01:02:43,085
one onto the number i So if we were to scale it up even further, 

1005
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:47,210
I don't think I have it animated here But if we were to take that yellow dot 

1006
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:51,335
and raise it up until it got to five halves times pi i What you would see is 

1007
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,460
that the unit circle?

1008
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,119
Uh is rotated around on itself so that f of negative f of one would rotate around another 

1009
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,953
two pi radians and land where it is But it would stretch out the real axis a lot more 

1010
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:07,900
Which was the sense in which another output of i to the i is a much much smaller number.

1011
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:08,880
It was around.

1012
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,340
What was it?

1013
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,400
0.0003 or so But we can also see what I think is quite fun.

1014
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,573
What happens if we consider Alternate expressions 

1015
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:21,000
that we want to interpret as two to the power x right?

1016
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,961
So when r is a purely real number the natural log of two kind of makes sense 

1017
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:28,923
that when you plug it in here The expression we get is what we want to write 

1018
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:33,040
as two to the power x But what if we start moving it in the imaginary direction?

1019
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:40,420
Okay And what i'll first do is i'll move it up by pi i units Now what's going on here?

1020
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,940
We have x of r times x and r is equal to this value, 

1021
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:48,369
which is the natural log of two plus pi times i What that means is that 

1022
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:49,600
when we plug in one?

1023
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,104
f of one is at negative two, so we want to write this function as negative two to the 

1024
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:58,553
power x right, and that's actually something that You know, 

1025
01:03:58,553 --> 01:04:03,727
it's it's a little deceptively simple when we write a negative number to a power Negative 

1026
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:08,557
two To the power x it doesn't at first look like this necessarily it brings us into 

1027
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:13,616
the complex numbers in any way but of course when we plug in even a value like One half 

1028
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:18,675
Where we're kind of asking for a square root of negative two We we realize that we want 

1029
01:04:18,675 --> 01:04:23,677
to write this as something like i times the square root of two But if you were to look 

1030
01:04:23,677 --> 01:04:28,391
at this function negative two to the power x in the full complex domain that it's 

1031
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:33,565
dealing with What you're looking at is a function that takes the value of one to negative 

1032
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:38,567
two And if it does that what it does to the rest of the real number line is it kind of 

1033
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:39,660
spirals it outward?

1034
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,208
So we see that f of negative one sits at negative one half About where you would expect 

1035
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:50,064
if you were to follow to f of one half It would sit exactly on the imaginary line and 

1036
01:04:50,064 --> 01:04:54,920
f of one half would be square root of two Well, my mouse is not where I want it to be.

1037
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,230
It would be around a square root of two times i and As you continue further on this is 

1038
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:05,663
showing you all of the real value powers of negative two to the x it necessarily spirals 

1039
01:05:05,663 --> 01:05:10,851
around Um, but we could also move our value of r even higher and get it up to around 

1040
01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:14,086
tau times i around 6.28 times i And in that context, 

1041
01:05:14,086 --> 01:05:19,214
this is another function that we would want to write as something like two to the x 

1042
01:05:19,214 --> 01:05:24,464
because For any whole number to whole number that you plug in for x it will look like 

1043
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:29,713
repeated multiplication And it even has kind of reasonable values for things like one 

1044
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:34,841
half where it spits out the negative square root instead of the positive square But 

1045
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:40,090
what it's actually doing is a transformation to the plane where it puts everything Uh 

1046
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:45,401
is the real number line ends up being a very tightly wound spiral That goes around and 

1047
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:50,650
it just spirals in such a way that f of one lands right on the number two so it is in 

1048
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:56,022
that sense that we could say, um two to the x is Is plausibly interpreted as a separate 

1049
01:05:56,022 --> 01:06:01,149
exponential function from the one that we are traditionally used to so I think with 

1050
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:06,216
all of that I will um I will leave things for today and i'll just leave you with a 

1051
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:08,780
couple lingering questions to think about.

1052
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,440
Okay, so If you want to think of i to the i as being a multi-valued expression, right?

1053
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:20,650
You could you could say we adopt a convention Fancifully you'd say you choose a branch 

1054
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:25,566
of the natural logarithm function and maybe that locks you into this being e to the 

1055
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:30,540
negative pi halves But if you say this kind of wants to be infinitely many different 

1056
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:35,397
values like the various ones that we saw How many values does two to the one-third 

1057
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:40,195
want to be in the same sense where we are replacing two with various different uh 

1058
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:44,993
various different options for e to the x Such that e to the x equals two How many 

1059
01:06:44,993 --> 01:06:50,026
different values does that want to be or how many values does two to the three-tenths 

1060
01:06:50,026 --> 01:06:50,670
want to be?

1061
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,771
Phrased differently of all of the uh, let me say of all of the exponential functions 

1062
01:06:57,771 --> 01:07:03,455
So f of x which satisfy oh have I written it down somewhere f of x that satisfies 

1063
01:07:03,455 --> 01:07:09,070
All of these properties that i've written so if it satisfies all of these um and 

1064
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:14,754
if f of one is equal to two Right, how many different outputs are we going to get 

1065
01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:20,300
when we plug in x equals three-tenths for the various options for what function?

1066
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,580
That is and how many outputs are we going to get?

1067
01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:28,980
For two to the pi for the various functions that two to the x could represent If we're 

1068
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:34,100
thinking of two to the x as some kind of exponential function exponential in the sense 

1069
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,396
of these sort of abstract properties and if we uh yeah, 

1070
01:07:37,396 --> 01:07:42,576
if we if we have a Class of different such functions and we want to plug in pi it makes 

1071
01:07:42,576 --> 01:07:47,696
me laugh just because it's such a I don't know Kind of a funny answer that pops out As 

1072
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,580
you're trying to think about it.

1073
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:54,143
So those are the questions that i'll leave you with and I think this is you know, 

1074
01:07:54,143 --> 01:07:58,776
my my My central question in approaching today's lecture was whether I wanted to be 

1075
01:07:58,776 --> 01:08:03,576
um kind of describing like these abstract properties of exponential functions and it's 

1076
01:08:03,576 --> 01:08:08,264
just cool to me that Starting from those abstract properties you get locked into the 

1077
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:12,953
idea of e to the rx or more You know, I think more honestly written exp of r times x 

1078
01:08:12,953 --> 01:08:17,697
for different values of r That it locks you in that far but it doesn't lock you in as 

1079
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:22,276
far as having an unambiguous Notion of what two to the power x should be much less 

1080
01:08:22,276 --> 01:08:26,909
something like i to the power x The risk in that of course is that sometimes people 

1081
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:31,708
don't love abstraction and sometimes it doesn't come off as approachable But if that's 

1082
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:36,397
the case, you know, you just let me know I think I think there's a whole interesting 

1083
01:08:36,397 --> 01:08:41,031
circle of thoughts that surrounds all of this stuff to include power towers because 

1084
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:45,775
if you want to Actually talk about power towers like we were last time in the context 

1085
01:08:45,775 --> 01:08:50,519
of complex numbers or even with negative bases You have to be thinking through things 

1086
01:08:50,519 --> 01:08:54,435
like this so, um, it was a question that we had up on screen Uh, yeah, 

1087
01:08:54,435 --> 01:08:58,241
what happens if we do this for i to the power i titration, you know, 

1088
01:08:58,241 --> 01:09:02,875
let's just try this Let's just go ahead and try a power tower where we're raising i 

1089
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:07,509
to a given power and see what uh, what pops out of it so I wasn't planning on doing 

1090
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:12,087
this but we can We can always pull up python and essentially do what we were doing 

1091
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:16,886
last time so the way that this would work Is we were starting off with some base value 

1092
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,700
and then for some kind of range What were we doing?

1093
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,036
We were taking a and we're going to reassign it to be whatever The base 

1094
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:31,399
which in this case is i raised to the power of a should be Okay, cool.

1095
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:37,115
So we're going to do that and then we're going to print off the value of a and let's just 

1096
01:09:37,115 --> 01:09:42,790
do this for Uh, yeah, it's a much bigger number like 200 uh So it seems like what happens 

1097
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:48,213
is There's there's potential for chaos with these things like sometimes it's not that 

1098
01:09:48,213 --> 01:09:53,762
you've landed on a stable A stable value or it's not even that you've diverged it could 

1099
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:59,374
be that you're bouncing between a cycle of values or That you're like literally bouncing 

1100
01:09:59,374 --> 01:10:04,923
in a way that's um, it's not periodic or anything and it's actually chaotic I I suspect 

1101
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:10,472
that doesn't happen for i but it's a thing to potentially look out for It looks like it 

1102
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:15,769
does kind of stabilize um, maybe there's Some little subjection to numerical error, 

1103
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:21,255
but we stay pretty consistently around something with a real part of 0.43 and 0.36 Now 

1104
01:10:21,255 --> 01:10:26,804
what I would want to emphasize though is this expression So let's set a back to b equal 

1105
01:10:26,804 --> 01:10:32,480
to 1 this expression of taking i to the power of a remember That's a little bit ambiguous.

1106
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,790
It depends on what choice of the function I we actually have so let me Let me 

1107
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:43,304
import NumPy so I have the exponential function Let me go For our big range like 

1108
01:10:43,304 --> 01:10:46,708
we had before Rather than writing it as you know, 

1109
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:52,359
something that's like i to the power of x I'm going to write it as the exponential 

1110
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:58,009
function of a different constant right a different constant That i'm going to make 

1111
01:10:58,009 --> 01:11:00,120
I want it to be five pi halves.

1112
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:06,461
So i'll do five pi halves times i so it's a complex number And it's got five pi 

1113
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:13,040
halves as the imaginary part So this is five pi halves times i and what am I doing?

1114
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:17,500
I'm exponentiating that So I want to multiply a onto the inside there.

1115
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:21,897
Okay, this is basically another way that you could interpret the expression i to the 

1116
01:11:21,897 --> 01:11:26,326
x Thankfully you would say you've chosen a different branch of the natural log function 

1117
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:30,604
But it is another Function which we could iterate on itself and see what happens and 

1118
01:11:30,604 --> 01:11:33,574
we might get a different result Ah very interesting, okay, 

1119
01:11:33,574 --> 01:11:37,701
so we actually have a different result It looks like what ends up happening is it 

1120
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:39,060
bounces between two values?

1121
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,660
Oh, wow, is it period three?

1122
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,180
That's interesting period three implies chaos.

1123
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:49,477
So we've got seven point three five then zero then point nine nine So it looks like it 

1124
01:11:49,477 --> 01:11:54,594
gets into the cycle of bouncing between three separate values even though um In theory 

1125
01:11:54,594 --> 01:11:59,652
in both of those cases we were doing something that was i to the x iterated on itself 

1126
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:04,770
It has everything to do with what actual function you think i to the x is referring to 

1127
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:09,946
so in that sense The power tower question is ambiguous Usually you just choose it to be 

1128
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:15,240
the pi halves i variant but it's more fun to see that it can be multiple things All right.

1129
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,560
We have addition multiplication exponentiation titration.

1130
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:21,620
Can we think of something in between halfway between multiplication and exponentiation?

1131
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,744
oh, that's an uh, I mean Spirit of it because each one of them it comes 

1132
01:12:26,744 --> 01:12:30,548
down to like a discrete step of you're repeating the previous operation 

1133
01:12:30,548 --> 01:12:34,141
But oftentimes in math when you have something initially defined in 

1134
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,840
terms of repetition Like exponentiation you can extend it beyond that.

1135
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,294
I can't think of anything off the top of my head, 

1136
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:44,520
but that's an interesting question I don't know if that's been That's an extended notion.

1137
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,003
I mean you have things like fractional derivatives you have things like fractional 

1138
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:51,816
and complex exponents So it doesn't seem outlandish, 

1139
01:12:51,816 --> 01:12:56,007
but i'm not familiar with one myself And then lastly do complex numbers to the 

1140
01:12:56,007 --> 01:13:00,199
power of complex number values arise in physics and if yes How does one decide 

1141
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:01,420
which values are valid?

1142
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,100
so I can't think of if they necessary.

1143
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,340
Oh, sorry scene switching.

1144
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,938
I can't think of if they Come up in physics in like a direct 

1145
01:13:09,938 --> 01:13:13,400
sense and this is probably just because i'm not a physicist.

1146
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,125
So I uh, I would say like ask ask your neighborhood physicist and see see what 

1147
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,992
they have to say I mean clearly the point of teaching the lesson here is that the 

1148
01:13:20,992 --> 01:13:24,812
thoughts that you have to go through to make sense out of It do build a stronger 

1149
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:28,727
relationship with exponentials things like it's not just more natural to represent 

1150
01:13:28,727 --> 01:13:31,226
them as e to the rx Once you get to complex numbers, 

1151
01:13:31,226 --> 01:13:35,093
you kind of have to represent them that way Whereas previously in like physics or 

1152
01:13:35,093 --> 01:13:36,320
other real world contexts.
