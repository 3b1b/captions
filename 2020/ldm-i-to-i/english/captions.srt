00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to what is now the second to last in the Lockdown Math series.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,880
So we've been talking a lot about exponential functions and complex numbers and the interplay of the two of them,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,760
and I thought what might be a very nice culminating topic to help bring it all together and show really the full breadth of what

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,880
exponential functions are and what they can be would be to talk about raising i to the power i.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,720
Now this is a, this is a funny little expression because

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,520
usually if we think about powers, if we were doing something like i to the fourth,

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,960
you know, we know how to think about it in terms of repeated multiplication. We're just multiplying something by itself four different times.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,480
And in general you'd like to think of i to the x as some variant of that,

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,880
but as soon as x becomes a complex number, we should realize that it's really nothing

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
like the above. So it's really nothing like this.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,840
Instead, the way that we think about it is going to have to be very related to the way that we think about raising e

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
to various different numbers, e being that kind of home base for us. And in fact if we go,

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,280
let's not show where things are going too much here,

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
if we go ahead and rewrite that base i in terms of e,

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,120
it can help us make sense out of this expression. But I don't want to do that,

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,800
I want you to do that for me. So if you head on over to 3b1b.co.live, link is in the description,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
it'll forward you on over to item pool,

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
which now asks us

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,520
write a value of x so that e to the x is equal to i.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,160
That way we'll be able to replace it in the base of our expression.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,400
And then once we do that, maybe we can use our knowledge of e and

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,240
exponentials of e in order to make some sense out of this expression. Now

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,640
let me just add as a quick reminder while everyone is rolling in with answers for that, that when we write e to the x and

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,520
complex numbers are in the mix, we are no longer talking about repeated multiplication.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,640
And instead I think the healthiest way to think about it is that e to the x is a shorthand

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,440
for this polynomial that I might call exp.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,360
It's the it's sort of the main exponential function. All other exponential functions derive from this in a way that I'll describe later on in

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,160
this episode actually.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
And it's it's a lovely polynomial.

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,360
It's 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6. Each term looks like a power of x divided by

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
the factorial of that power.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,160
So the reason for doing that is then it can actually make sense to plug in things like

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,200
complex values. And one of the things that we looked at earlier in the series was how if you're plugging in imaginary values,

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,800
you know, let's say I go over here and I'm gonna plug in i

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,200
where i is the square root of negative 1 times some value theta,

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,900
we can very literally read off what it means to exponentiate it in that context.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,600
For example, this very first term 1 we might think of as a vector pointing from 0 to 1.

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,920
The next term which is some scaled version of i, well

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,680
it's a 90 degree rotation of that first vector scaled a little bit differently.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,240
Then the next vector is a 90 degree rotation of that scaled differently. And depending on what this value theta equals,

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,400
the way that these things scale is going to look very different. And it's in general a difficult thing to think about,

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,260
but it's at least a sensible thing to think about, right? So that when we go to our expression

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,740
e to the x and we're going to start thinking about i and various complex numbers,

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,960
it makes sense computationally what it means.

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,040
And then there's going to be a separate illustration that I'll pull up in a moment for how it makes sense in terms of intuition

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
what it means.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,400
But first let's just see how people are doing on our

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,880
live quiz finding a value of x so that e to the x is equal to i.

49
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Now,

50
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
how have people done here?

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay, so

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,240
the top answer is in a sense absolutely correct you could say. By definition, the natural log is the inverse function of

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
exponentiation. So

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,760
whatever the answer is here, we should be able to write it as natural log of i. The problem is that's not really helpful,

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
it's not going to move us forward,

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,400
because if we if we tried to use that, you know, we pop over here and we say instead of writing

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
i I'm going to write e to the natural log of i and

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,360
then I'm going to be raising that to some kind of power. It begs the question and the only thing I can really do from

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,680
here is simplify that down to be i which sort of gets us nowhere.

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,720
So to move forward and to think is there a number, some concrete point on the plane that I can plug in?

61
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
For that we'd want to look at,

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,960
oh, I accidentally skipped ahead of my questions here.

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,120
Let me go back, pull up people's answers.

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
Got a little excited, a little trigger-happy with some of my clicking around here and

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,320
the second most common answer is something that's going to actually help us move forward here, which was one half of i times pi.

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,640
And then that's the same as what was written, what was categorized as the third most common one, one half pi times i,

67
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,760
just swapping the two numbers there and

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,800
I think, yeah, I think the one following that I'm guessing people either forgot to mention the i

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,480
but let's just, let's just write that out and kind of see where this moves us. One half i times pi.

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,280
Now if you're confused about where that came from, I think this is a good time to remind ourselves of

71
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Euler's formula and what it's really saying. It's one half pi times i where again,

72
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,440
computationally, this very literally means if we plug in pi over 2 for theta here, which would be something like

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,520
1.57 or so. Let me see if I can, I don't think I'll be able to get it right on the head,

74
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,320
but something in the 1.57 range. If you were to play out this whole sum,

75
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,480
the claim of saying that e to the pi halves i equals i is that

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,640
when you play all of this out and you add all of the terms together, you're going to get to the top here.

77
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,040
But usually this is kind of a complicated way to think about it.

78
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,800
People don't want to pull up this whole polynomial and imagine the spiraling sum.

79
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,140
I think it's helpful just in case you find yourself doubting the

80
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,080
the reality of what we're talking about or the fact that it's something sensible.

81
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,640
Almost always, anytime that people are thinking about complex exponentials, instead they find themselves thinking something like

82
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
e to the i times theta,

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
they just immediately know,

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,520
maybe not immediately, but you come to immediately know of Euler's formula. That it's telling you you walk a distance theta

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,520
around the unit circle, which is to say an angle of theta radians,

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,160
and whatever point you're sitting at on the complex plane, that's the output. So people who knew about this would say, hmm,

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
i as a number is also sitting on the unit circle,

88
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,640
so I just have to walk an angle of 90 degrees, pi halves radians. And from here

89
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,040
we can actually move forward and get kind of a funny-looking answer.

90
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Because that i will hop to the inside and we'll be looking at e to the pi halves times i squared.

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,840
i squared is negative 1 by definition, so this looks like e to the negative pi halves.

92
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,800
That is a purely real number. You could just plug that into your calculator, and it's actually around

93
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,320
0.2 or so. It's about a fifth, which is weird

94
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,480
that you take an imaginary number and raise it to an imaginary power and that gets you a real number.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
Maybe it feels a little bit weird that e and pi have shown up. Not that much if we're thinking in terms of

96
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
Euler's formula and all of that, but I

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,120
kind of want to go deeper on this one, right?

98
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,600
I think it's one thing to plug in some numbers and see what pops out.

99
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,840
And there's a couple great videos who have talked about i to the i from some of my favorite channels. Stand Up Math

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,520
with Matt Parker, he talked about i to the i, did a beautiful job.

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Black Pin Red Pin did another i to the i video, truly great.

102
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,720
One thing that I try to,

103
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,840
you know, I try to do is add something into the mix if I'm talking about a topic that others already have. And in this

104
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,800
case, I think one of the most interesting questions you can ask before we jump in, I mean

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,480
there's lots of interesting things about this expression i to the i,

106
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,640
but if we're seeking intuition, thinking about how i is a 90 degree rotation,

107
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,960
right, that's the way that it acts when we're multiplying things on the complex plane.

108
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,600
We think of it very intuitively as the thing that upon multiplication turns stuff 90 degrees or pi halves radians.

109
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,480
So when you look at this expression that i to the power i equals e to the negative pi halves,

110
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,960
it begs the question in what sense do two 90 degree rotations

111
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,520
combine to make this real number, this very specific real number of e to the negative pi halves, around 0.2079

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
on and on. And

113
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,600
it's like those games that sometimes you play with arithmetic where someone says, oh, I'll give you the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6,

114
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,680
see if you can combine them in some way with addition, multiplication, division, to get some other specific number.

115
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,400
Like 24, in that case is a particularly fun puzzle. In this case, it's kind of like that style of puzzle on steroids.

116
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,880
How do we take the idea of a 90 degree rotation and

117
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,560
combine it with itself twice in some mathematical sense such that we get out this number e to the negative pi halves?

118
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,640
Where is that intuition coming from? And the first step, I would say,

119
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,800
is to remind ourselves of the intuition for why it is that Euler's formula works.

120
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,040
Why it is that I can take an expression like e to the pi halves i and say that that's the same thing as i.

121
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
You know, I just showed what it means in a very

122
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,740
computational sense, what the claim is with this spiraling sum, but that tells us nothing about why.

123
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,240
Why it would be the case that this is how things behave.

124
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,840
Now I've at this point made, you know, quite a number of videos on variants of this,

125
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,560
but I think the quickest one is to think of it dynamically somehow.

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,900
So if we take an expression like e to the i times t and we're thinking of that as describing a dynamic,

127
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,740
you're going to have a position that changes over time.

128
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,060
Then what I'll do is I'm going to start drawing that with a blue vector and we know as an initial condition

129
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,980
that when we raise e to the 0 that's at 1. So where we are at time t equals 0 is equal to 1.

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,120
But let's say that's all we know, right?

131
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,140
We haven't been told about Euler's formula or how we should be thinking about it with circles or anything like that.

132
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,980
That's just where we're starting. Well, one thing we might know is that e to the x is its own derivative.

133
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,580
So if we're thinking of dynamics here, we might ask about the velocity of our position taking its derivative and

134
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,580
because e to the x is its own derivative, this is quite nice. The outer expression is going to stay the same.

135
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:11,500
And then the inner expression as we're applying the chain rule is just i times t. So we multiply the whole outer thing by i.

136
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
And this gives us a literal way to read

137
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,820
the equation in terms of dynamics, right?

138
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:25,020
What we're saying is take whatever your position vector is, if you rotate that 90 degrees you apply this action of i,

139
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
that's going to give you the velocity vector.

140
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,620
So wherever you're standing, draw a vector from 0, the origin, up to where you are,

141
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,200
rotate that vector 90 degrees, that gives you your velocity. And that's enough to tell you how to move,

142
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
assuming you know that where you're starting. And

143
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,400
of course we have to draw this out in the complex plane, the fact that we've rotated 90 degrees already brings us there. And

144
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,180
I could draw out a bunch of different potential position vectors,

145
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,800
you know,

146
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,360
suggestively maybe putting them on a circle and saying really imagine yourself sitting at any one of those and

147
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,960
following the rule for this dynamic. And what it would tell you is, okay, I've got to sit there,

148
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,160
rotate my vector 90 degrees, that describes my velocity.

149
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,100
And it doesn't necessarily have to be any one of the points on that circle. Any point in the plane, if you were following this

150
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,120
dynamic, you say rotate that vector 90 degrees, which if we're drawing a vector field,

151
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,000
we often scale down, and it's all well and good. And here you could phrase this question without even talking about

152
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,780
exponentials or complex numbers or anything like that. And in fact, I'm going to go back to the quiz just to

153
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:32,060
really emphasize that Euler's formula and what it's claiming and then how we apply it to expressions like i to the power i

154
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,320
is very, it's really intuitive as soon as we're putting some dynamics into it. And we can ask questions removed from the idea of exponentials

155
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,160
that actually have the same substance in their answers. So here,

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,360
I want you to imagine starting a walk from the point 1,0 on the coordinate plane

157
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,320
in such a way that at all moments your velocity vector is a 90 degree

158
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,640
counterclockwise rotation of the vector drawn from 0,0, the origin, up to where you are.

159
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,560
After pi halves units of time, where will you be on the plane?

160
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,520
Okay, so kind of think about that. Think about that dynamic and where you'll end up after a little bit of time.

161
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,240
While you answer, let me see if we have any questions that have popped in from the audience.

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,840
No questions at the moment,

163
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,480
at least that I see. So if ever you do want to ask, go to Twitter, use the hashtag locked down math.

164
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,280
Those will be forwarded to me and then sometimes they'll be on the screen that I can pull up here.

165
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
And that always makes for a fun time.

166
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:47,440
For example, it seems like now we actually have one which is how about other solutions to the expression x equals i such as 5 pi halves?

167
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,860
Oh, I'm so glad you asked. I'm so very glad you asked. We will certainly be talking about that.

168
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
And if you just hold on for like one little moment,

169
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
that's exactly what we're going to get to. So

170
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
I'll keep that on file for us to pull up in a little moment.

171
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,120
But right now while we're just trying to get intuition around the first,

172
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,740
you know, there will be multiple answers. The first answer we saw was e to the negative pi halves. Let's

173
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
consider this lake question.

174
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,520
So it seems like

175
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,800
most of you correctly said that this would get you at the coordinates 0, 1.

176
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
It's essentially walking you a quarter of the way around. I said lake question.

177
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm sort of picturing in my head as a big circular lake that you're going for a walk around

178
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,520
because when you have this rule for dynamics where your position vector

179
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,460
rotated by 90 degrees gives you your velocity vector,

180
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
that is circular motion

181
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,280
because the tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to its radius. So this rule of motion

182
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,160
corresponds with walking around a circle and that's kind of the intuition for Euler's formula, right?

183
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,720
You keep increasing that value of t and this dynamical rule,

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
if e to the i t is going to behave according to the derivatives that we expect of a function like e to the t

185
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,520
necessarily walks you around a circle. So in particular,

186
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,800
when we're wondering how long does it take to get to i,

187
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,040
you would basically say just wait for an amount of time equal to, well, whatever the angle to get up there is, pi halves.

188
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,120
Okay, so in this case we're thinking pi halves. Let me see if I can get it exactly on the dot. Okay, 1.57.

189
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,560
We're thinking of pi halves as kind of an amount of time for these dynamics to get you on the number i.

190
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,680
And that gives us the first half of our intuition if we want to go back to our formula and we're asking in what sense do

191
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,240
two 90 degree rotations combine to make e to the negative pi halves?

192
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Once we're thinking of our dynamics here as

193
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,960
each one of your velocity vectors as a 90 degree rotation of your position,

194
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,640
this base i,

195
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,720
the way that we're kind of thinking about it reading it off as something with meaning rather than just a number, is that as

196
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,200
a point on the plane, it's where you get after traveling for pi halves units of time

197
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,880
according to the dynamics of this expression, according to the idea that your velocity is always a 90 degree rotation of your position.

198
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,840
Okay, so that's awfully nice. And in fact, there's already sort of two different i's at play here, which, or I guess

199
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,600
there's three different i's at play. We have this base, which is describing the 90 degrees that we walk around the circle.

200
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,200
We have the i that's sitting here, which is describing the rule of

201
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,280
rotating your velocity vector 90 degrees.

202
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,520
But now we're going to introduce another i, which essentially has this effect of changing what your dynamics are.

203
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,680
Because as we go from e to the i times t and

204
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,600
instead we, you know, raise things to another power of i, which I'll just write with a little

205
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,520
caret i, if we take e to the i t and we alter what that expression is by raising it to the i,

206
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,960
what we get is e to the negative t.

207
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,880
Okay, so we have e to the negative t and

208
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,960
if we try to interpret that with the same sort of dynamics that we had above in terms of a velocity and a position,

209
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
what that's telling us is

210
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,680
that the derivative of

211
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,800
our new dynamic e to the negative t is equal to

212
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,320
well now the constant sitting in front of t is negative 1, so our chain rule will have it be negative 1 times

213
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,280
itself

214
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,520
times e to the negative t. So whatever your position is, now your velocity is negative 1 times itself.

215
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,120
So the effect of raising to another power i is kind of like we took the dynamics,

216
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,760
we looked at every velocity vector, and we said rotate another 90 degrees so that in this context it would actually be

217
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,600
in the beginning a velocity vector pointing backwards

218
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,160
with one unit. So if you're starting off at the number 1, your initial velocity is to walk straight towards 0 and

219
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,440
as you walk even lower, if you were sitting at 1 half, then you would still be walking towards 0,

220
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,600
but now your velocity vector would be negative 1 times where you are, which is negative 1 half.

221
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,680
And what this means for the actual motion that this would imply, you might kind of imagine it,

222
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,320
I haven't animated this nicely yet or anything,

223
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,760
but if you look at this whole vector field and you ask each one of those vectors,

224
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,560
take wherever you are and rotate another 90 degrees

225
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,120
counterclockwise, they would all be pointed in towards the origin.

226
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,280
So if you were to have a little dot move in such a way that its velocity always matches whatever

227
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,120
vector it's sitting on top of, what you would end up with

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
is something where with each time step,

229
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,560
it kind of takes a step towards 0 and it just, with each of your time steps, is walking towards 0 and each step

230
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,720
has a size that gets smaller and smaller as you actually approach 0.

231
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,280
And of course in practice this would be a bunch of infinitesimal steps rather than

232
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,480
very concrete sizing. You might be very exact about it if you wanted and say what we're looking at is

233
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,200
scaling down by some number just less than 1 and we're doing this n different times and then we're

234
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,560
going to multiply that by however much time we're waiting.

235
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
And you take this as a limiting expression.

236
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,280
That's just what we talked about in the compound interest lecture, if you're curious.

237
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,640
And it's kind of the standard way to talk about e to powers is this sort of limit.

238
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,220
You could also have that t living on the inside here instead if you wanted.

239
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
But now if we think about

240
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,960
our original point i, our base, what that meant, it was saying look at our dynamics and

241
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
it's the point you get to when you wait pi halves units of time.

242
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,480
So the effect of raising to the i changes our dynamics in such a way that instead of walking around a circle

243
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,800
we're doing this kind of exponential decay. We're moving towards 0 at a slowing and slowing rate. And the place that you end up

244
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,880
after pi halves units of time will be e to the negative pi halves

245
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
around 0.2079.

246
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,480
So, you know, that's a little bit of intuition for in what sense do two 90 degree rotations combine to get you this very specific

247
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,880
value. One of them changes your dynamics and the original one came from the idea of walking pi halves radians.

248
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,280
So I think that's kind of satisfying in its own way because otherwise when you look at the expression i to the i

249
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,760
equals e to the negative pi halves, it's like what does any of this mean?

250
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,400
This doesn't correspond to any, you know, thing that might see in the real world.

251
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,800
But thinking through the intuitions actually have you thinking through things like what are the dynamics of circular motion?

252
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,240
What are the dynamics for exponential decay? Things that come up in the real world all the time.

253
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
But there is a potentially more pressing question

254
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,400
which was raised and let's see if it's still up there.

255
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Well, whoever asked it a little bit earlier. What about other solutions to e to the x equals i?

256
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,480
I think that's that's actually spot-on. And in fact, let me let me ask other people to contribute some

257
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
solutions here. So let's let's go to our quiz.

258
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,200
Let me go to

259
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,120
question number three

260
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
which is going to be very similar

261
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,040
to a question that was already seen which is to write a value of x

262
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,400
other than the one we just saw x equals pi halves times i so that e to the x equals i.

263
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,880
And feel free to be as creative as you want to try to get an answer that other people haven't written, right?

264
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,760
Just to really emphasize that there are actually quite a few different options here and then in a moment

265
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,240
we'll talk about why there are quite a few options if it's not already clear.

266
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,640
But I'll give you a moment to think of which of the many possible values of x you could choose is the one that you

267
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,280
want to put your fingerprint on that you want to be contributing to the live stats page that we're seeing right now.

268
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I'll give you a little moment.

269
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,360
And as you're answering that we've got a question coming in that says wouldn't it be more accurate to say that i to the power i is

270
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,760
i different 90 degree rotations, not two 90 degree rotations. After all it's multiplying by i. That's the rotation.

271
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,520
So if we stretch the meaning of words too thin aren't we multiplying by i i times?

272
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,040
I mean, I think the most honest answer here is just no not at all.

273
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,420
No offense meant but that's just not what exponentiation actually means as soon as we're extending to the idea of complex numbers.

274
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,420
I

275
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,260
get the intent you kind of want to stretch the meaning of taking i to the i it's as if you're multiplying by itself i

276
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,980
different times, but I cannot think of a way that that actually like satisfactorily makes sense in my mind.

277
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:32,980
What I do think makes some sense is to try to think of the function i to the x.

278
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,900
Say what properties do we want this function to have and in the context of counting numbers, you know

279
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,620
if n and k are just things like 3 and 5 we know that it should satisfy this idea of

280
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,700
multiplying the outputs correspond to adding the inputs.

281
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,880
So we want to say if this is any kind of function and I you know

282
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,300
I've said this in many different forms in many different places

283
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:02,300
we want it to satisfy the property that when you add the inputs you multiply the outputs. That to me is

284
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,800
kind of what exponentiation is more so than trying to stretch the idea of repeated multiplication.

285
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
So

286
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,400
like if it I mean correct me if I'm wrong if you can definitely if you can find some way where

287
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,820
if you read this off in a stretching language context saying we're taking a 90 degree rotation and applying that i different times

288
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,400
that's not nonsense and that somehow like intuitively gets you to the answer e to the negative pi halves.

289
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm all ears, but I think the healthier relationship to have is to say we have this central property for exponentiation

290
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,700
which definitely holds in the context of repeated multiplication

291
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,980
but to extend beyond the places where repeated multiplication makes any sense because it just it just doesn't make sense

292
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,000
when we're talking about something that's not a counting number like i or other crazy things that we exponentiate in math like matrices

293
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
focus focus on the property more so than

294
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,520
what some people think of as the origins of that property or the original intuition behind it.

295
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,620
And an interesting question will be you know is is there just one such function that feels reasonable to write for this

296
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,760
because you know if we're gonna write it as i to the x not only should it satisfy this it should also satisfy

297
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
you know when we plug in the number one

298
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,560
we get i

299
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,520
presumably i to the power one however we're thinking of this function should be i.

300
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,820
Is there just one such function or are there multiple such functions?

301
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,020
That's what the quiz question is starting to get at and we've got lots of different answers which always makes me happy

302
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:40,700
so let's see some of the variety that people have thrown in here. So we've got 5 pi i halves great that absolutely is another

303
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,420
value that we could plug in for x here and just to spell out that a little bit more

304
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,860
visually if we were to look back at our circle here where we've at the moment walked

305
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,420
for an amount of time equal to pi halves which is

306
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,380
1.57 what if instead we took another full turn and we go another pi halves to get us to pi

307
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,680
which you know we might kind of record that's where the e to the pi i value is

308
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,140
we walk another pi halves we walk another pi halves which at this point

309
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,020
we would have gone a full circle getting us back to one and then we walk for five pi halves

310
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,340
which numerically is about 7.85

311
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,820
yeah, that absolutely is another number that gets us on top of i and if we were to go through the whole rigmarole of

312
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,640
re-expressing i to the power i

313
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,900
by first writing e to the 5 pi halves i

314
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,380
to the power i

315
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,620
those i's multiply to become negative and we'd be looking at e to the negative 5 pi halves

316
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,060
which is a very different number right we can actually calculate this

317
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,200
I'm not sure off the top of my head, but let's take a look at a Desmos. Maybe go over here

318
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,360
Let's ask it. What is e to the negative 5 pi halves 0.000388

319
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,060
Okay, 0.000388

320
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,260
much smaller number

321
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
0.000388

322
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,680
Which begs the question of okay i to the i what are you right?

323
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:20,080
Are you about a fifth like we saw before around 0.2, or are you this much smaller number and in terms of our intuition?

324
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
It's basically

325
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,700
a question of how we're interpreting that base i right are we thinking of it as you wait about

326
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,440
1.57 units of time and then you translate your dynamics into something that looks like decay

327
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,400
rather than spinning and see where you decay to after that amount of time which is 0.2 or

328
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,720
Do you wait even longer for about 7.85 units of time which is 5 pi halves and what see what happens when you decay for?

329
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
That long which gets you to a much smaller number

330
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,480
But that's not the only answer that we could enter right we have other people coming in here with negative 3 halves times i pi

331
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,120
Which you know in terms of a unit circle?

332
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,640
We could think of as saying hey if I want to get to I rather than walking

333
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,360
90 degrees pi halves radians that way what if I walk

334
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,720
270 degrees the other way

335
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,420
3 pi halves radians which maybe I'll think of as negative because the convention is usually that counterclockwise is positive

336
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,720
That absolutely is another way to express it and that would get us a different answer if we had e to the negative

337
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
3 pi halves i

338
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,380
All to the power i we go through the same game now the i squared cancels with a negative

339
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,560
that's already there, and we have a positive 3 pi halves and

340
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,440
Numerically this gets us an even different looking answer from what we had before

341
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,280
Which if we go over and we say hey, what is

342
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,000
e to the 3 pi not 3 o 3 pi halves

343
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,720
111 point 3 1 very different kind of number than what we saw before

344
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:03,080
111 point what was it 111 point 3 1 great 111 point 3 1 or so

345
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,720
And again in terms of the intuition what you might be asking there is suppose we have this rotating dynamic

346
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,560
But we move backwards in time we see how long ago in time what I have to be

347
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,940
Such that if I played things forward from there

348
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,160
I would land on the number one my initial condition and

349
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,140
You have to go back in time 3 pi halves units

350
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,820
And then if you were to translate to the decay dynamics

351
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,660
Which is what raising to the eye is doing in this context you say if I'm starting at the number one

352
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,880
But I want to move backwards in time and say

353
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,040
Where should I have started if I want to decay down such that I end up at the number one?

354
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,320
After 3 pi halves units of time the answer is evidently starting at around a hundred and eleven for that kind of exponential decay

355
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,960
And you can see where this is going where there's actually infinitely many different values that we could

356
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,280
Plug in for X if we're thinking of e to the X as being I and people have entered a lot more here

357
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,200
Excuse me throwing my pin onto the ground as one does

358
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,840
classic for third place

359
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
9 pi halves great choice

360
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,720
1729 pi halves y'all are my favorite lots and lots of different options infinitely many different values which feels a little

361
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,680
Disconcerting at first right because we look at an expression

362
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,340
That seems like you know there's just gonna be some computation

363
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,280
I just plug that into my calculator and see what pops out and we've got multiple different values for it

364
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,060
So what's going on here right? What's going on and I think?

365
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
This really cuts to the idea of how we think about

366
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,400
Exponential in general right but before that I do want to emphasize that this isn't the only time in math

367
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,580
Where we come across a kind of ambiguity for how to interpret something?

368
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,160
I think because if I say something like what is the square root of 25?

369
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
You know I think a lot of us say well

370
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,920
It's five

371
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
But if we are saying you know

372
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,560
What should the square root be it should be some number X such that when you square it you get 25?

373
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,320
Well there's two different answers to that

374
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,720
Who's to say that our conventions should be that the square root function is positive gives us a positive number rather than?

375
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,840
Negative five so we have one expression that seems like it wants to have multiple different values

376
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,880
Right and this can actually happen in another context where instead of square roots

377
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,040
What if I was asking for the fourth root of something like 16?

378
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,680
Usually we would think of this as positive number two

379
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,120
Right two is a number such that when you multiply by itself four times you get sixteen seems like a decent answer to a fourth

380
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,720
Root, but if we're thinking of this as answering the question what number to the fourth equals 16?

381
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,940
There there is another answer to this we could also say

382
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,760
Negative two that's a number that when you multiply by itself four times you get sixteen

383
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,840
But there's another answer you could say two times. I that seems valid, but there's another answer you could think negative two times

384
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,520
I all four of these numbers satisfy that property so who's to say that?

385
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,880
The fourth root of 16 should be 2 and the answer ends up being well

386
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,080
We adopt a convention when there's multiple options like this when you have a multi-valued function

387
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,780
We often just choose one of those values to be what we mean when we want to treat it as a function as something with

388
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
a single input and a single output

389
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,920
in fancier lingo

390
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,800
This comes up all the time when we're dealing with complex numbers the idea of something as an operation kind of wanting

391
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,520
To have multiple values you'll sometimes hear the phrase branch

392
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,400
Where you choose a branch of the square root function?

393
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Which is to say you choose a certain convention?

394
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,320
In real numbers it's nice and easy sometimes because you say just choose the positive one

395
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,760
But there's no notion of which complex numbers are like the positive complex numbers when we want to take square roots just to give one

396
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,720
Example let's say we wanted to take the square root of I

397
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
And we want to know what should that be?

398
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Because there's multiple different answers

399
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,060
You know we think of I again is this 90 degree rotation

400
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,180
And if we were thinking of it as a 90 degree rotation it feels like the square root should be

401
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,940
You know something sitting at a 45 degree angle

402
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,080
Maybe that's the square root of I which we could write out very explicitly as root 2 over 2

403
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,780
root 2 over 2 I

404
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
That's just using trigonometry

405
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,820
but if we were thinking of I instead as being a

406
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:22,220
Negative 270 degree rotation it feels like half of that doing half of that operation should actually get us on the other side

407
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,180
Maybe the number sitting down here should be the square root of I and that's actually just the negative of what we saw before

408
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,540
Negative root 2 over 2 minus root 2 over 2 times I

409
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,140
Now in the context of real valued functions we can say yeah

410
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Just choose the square root to be whatever the positive answer is but which of these do you consider the positive answer?

411
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,400
You know maybe it feels like what we should consider this upper one because its coordinates have positive numbers

412
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,000
But however you try to define positive in a nice way here

413
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,500
That's going to be consistent you know for example two positive numbers should always multiply to make a positive number

414
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,580
You're not really going to be able to do it the way that you can for real numbers

415
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,700
And in fact this phenomenon here where we're taking roots is actually the same as the phenomenon

416
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,860
We were just looking at when we were talking about multiple values for I raised to the power of I

417
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,320
Because forget I raised to the power of I let me ask what much might look like it's a much simpler question

418
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,300
Of taking 2 to the power 1 half ok what's 2 to the 1 half?

419
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,260
And I think you say well

420
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,860
We know what this is we kind of define it to be the square root of 2 all is well and good

421
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,800
But what if I said let's approach this the same way that we were approaching our I to the I expression I want to first

422
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Express things as e to the something

423
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,660
right and

424
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,340
Then I'm going to raise that to the 1 half by multiplying the 1 half into the exponent

425
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,560
And I say okay, I can I guess I can do that e to the what is equal to 2 well

426
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,300
That's the natural log of 2

427
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,740
It's a constant which is around 0.69

428
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,300
or so

429
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:01,620
If we raise e to that power we'll get 2 so we could be thinking of this as e to the natural log of 2

430
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,220
times 1 half and if you wanted to if you

431
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Were thinking of e to the x?

432
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,980
You know this might be kind of overkill in the context of real numbers

433
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,740
But if you were thinking of e to the x as shorthand for this x function you could plug in the value

434
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,540
0.69 times 1 half which I guess would be around 0.345

435
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Ish something like that

436
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:32,540
You plug in that very concrete value into your polynomial see what it outputs, and it will output around 1.414 a

437
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,940
Nice real number square root of 2 what you would expect

438
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,840
But if we do the same thing we were just doing with I and

439
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,020
Acknowledging that there's actually multiple different answers when we want to write something as e to a power we could also write this

440
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:52,300
This might seem funny, but we could write it as e to the natural log of 2 plus 2 pi I

441
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,500
That whole thing raised to the 1 half

442
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:04,540
Right after all this value will come to equal to you could break it down as it's e to the natural log of 2

443
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,060
Multiplied by e to the 2 pi I

444
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,820
This one just has the effect of rotating things 360 degrees, so it's just going to equal 1

445
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,420
So we're looking at 2 times 1 great that feels like a valid substitution

446
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,100
and yet when we play the same game of

447
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,280
Taking this and raising it to a power and treating that by multiplying the power into the exponent look at what happens

448
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,180
We have e to the natural log of 2

449
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,760
times 1 half

450
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,880
plus

451
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,060
Well, what's 2 pi I times 1 half well that will be pi times I

452
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,060
Now this first part e to the natural log of 2 times 1 half that will end up being the familiar

453
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,860
Square root of 2 that's all well and good, but we're going to be multiplying that by e to the pi I

454
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,940
Right and quite famously e to the pi I is negative 1

455
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,320
So in this case it seems to be suggesting that if we are solving this expression 2 to the 1 half

456
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,760
By playing around with the different answers we could plug in for something like e to the

457
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:14,380
X equaling 1 half what we end up with is another answer what we might traditionally write as this negative square root of 2 and

458
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,580
Here I mean it's a little funny for it to have multiple values to look at 2 to the 1 half and say that's not equaling

459
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,640
One thing but based on choices we make it could equal

460
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,220
multiple different things

461
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
But the two things that it could seem quite reasonable

462
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,380
If there's going to be anything that 2 to the 1 half is it seems like it should either be

463
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,660
The positive square root that we're familiar with or the negative variant of that that doesn't actually seem like such a problem

464
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:43,880
And in fact we could um we could play this game even further where let me ask you for even more creative answers to

465
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,620
This expression because maybe we can find other funny powers of something like 2 to the power

466
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,940
X as we start plugging in various different values of X based on what substitution we make if we're

467
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,920
Abiding by the same rules that we were using in evaluating I to the power I

468
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,180
So this time the question asks or it specifies that one solution of the equation e to the x equals 2 is the real number

469
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,920
Natural log of 2 ok that one we know it. It's not boring, but it's boring in comparison to what else we can do

470
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,340
Can you think of another one and can you write some other?

471
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,540
answer to the question e to the x equals 2 and

472
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,820
Again creativity is welcomed, so I will give you another little moment for that

473
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,940
I

474
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,940
I

475
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,340
Will go ahead and lock in some answers here if that's alright with you

476
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,900
I'm not sure how much time it necessarily takes to do the math entry depending on what device you're looking at

477
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,940
but

478
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,560
Don't be too stressed if it's before you got the chance to

479
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,580
Into the question that you want into the answer that you want it to answer

480
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,820
So it looks like 131 of you have entered the variant where we take

481
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,580
Ln of 2 and we add 2ii and I guess I am in writing this question

482
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,700
Mistakenly like marked one of the answers as being correct when in fact there's quite a few different correct ones

483
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,420
So that's on me for the fact that I don't know if it looks to any of you like oh

484
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,820
It's red you got it wrong when you entered Ln of 2 plus 42. I pi which is of course a great choice

485
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,600
But you could also have something like 4 pi I plus the natural log of 2 or 6 pi I

486
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:48,300
Or really any integer multiple of 2 pi I if you add that it doesn't affect e to the X

487
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,700
Because it just has the effect of multiplying by e to the 2 pi I

488
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:59,440
Which is the effect of multiplying by 1 and again this has kind of a funny consequence where it seems to output kind of reasonable

489
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,180
Results when we do it as another example

490
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:07,100
It looks like the second most common entered expression there was that we might replace 2

491
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,720
So let's think we're thinking of 2 to the power of 1 4th, okay

492
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,020
there was a suggestion that we replaced 2 with e

493
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,500
to

494
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,020
the natural log of 2 plus 4 pi I

495
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,900
Okay

496
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,560
Plus 4 pi I and we raise all of that

497
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,060
To the 1 4th right well if you were to play the same game you would get e

498
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,980
To the natural log of 2 times 1 4th, and we'd be multiplying by e to the pi I

499
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,540
Now the first part of that is going to be the usual positive

500
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,240
Fourth root of 2 the thing we mean when you plug in an expression like fourth root of 2 into a calculator a nice small

501
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,900
Positive number, but then this second part is negative 1 so it seems to be saying

502
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,860
You know if we were to interpret 2 in this different way raising it to the 1 4th

503
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,740
You know it's not the usual answer that we get but it's a reasonable answer. It's another number that when you

504
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,400
Raise it to the fourth power you get 2

505
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,160
And if we had done this with even different values if instead we had been using

506
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,040
2 pi I

507
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,760
You know it's kind of fun to think about how that would have changed things if instead of 4 pi I we had been adding

508
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,600
2 pi I

509
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,080
Well, then over here. We would have been looking at pi halves times I and instead of multiplying by

510
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,520
Negative 1 we would have instead been multiplying by I

511
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,500
Which again is a valid answer it seems like a reasonable output for something like 2 to the 1 4th

512
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,260
So when you're looking at the fact that I to the power I seems to have multiple different values for it

513
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,880
Right we have this funny phenomenon where we could plug in e to the 5 pi halves I

514
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,740
Negative 3 pi halves I and we get what seemed like wildly different answers something super small something super big all very different from the

515
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,780
1 5th approximately 1 5th answer that we found before up here

516
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,780
It's exactly the same phenomenon as when you're asking something like what's 2 to the 1 4th and

517
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,780
Acknowledging that there's actually multiple different solutions to the expression X to the 4th equals 2

518
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,140
4 different solutions in fact and what you're looking at is the fact that there's multiple different solutions

519
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,180
To the expression e to the X equals some kind of base whether that base is I whether that base is 2

520
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,140
Whatever it might be and one way that we might

521
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,560
Think about this is that when you're dealing with real numbers things are just lovely things are nice

522
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,480
There's one-to-one relationships. You've got positives. It's great

523
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,800
Where if we want to think about exponential functions, let me just cover some of this stuff up

524
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,900
We have this nice back and forth where you can choose to express any exponential as a base to X like 2 to the X

525
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,520
Or you could express that same exponential as X of R times X which you know that is the polynomial that we refer to

526
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,620
Whenever implicitly refer to whenever we write something like e to the X

527
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,780
And there's a lovely back and forth because you can just take a natural logarithm of B

528
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,620
And it gives you one answer assuming that B is a positive number

529
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,940
And that's the same thing as saying that X of R is equal to B

530
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,980
So one way that I've talked about this earlier in the series is that if you were looking at the family of all possible

531
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,580
Exponentials right we could write them as X of R times X and change what R is

532
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,280
And this is exactly the same thing as writing e to the R times X if that's something you're more comfortable with

533
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,360
So e to the R times X X of R times X those are the same thing we could think about changing what that is

534
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,840
But on the other hand if you were to think about all possible exponentials as some base

535
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,200
Let me do base to the power of X and we're going to change what that base is

536
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,720
At first it feels like that's a different kind of expression to manipulate, but it's just another way of expressing the same family

537
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,740
And a way that you might think about this

538
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,700
For how do we think about what base does it correspond to if we're thinking a little bit more abstractly as

539
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,720
Exp of R times X and there's a reason I'm doing this because we're about to apply this to complex numbers where it's going to look

540
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:08,000
Weirder so follow through with me here if instead of looking at that base one thing I could do is say what is the value?

541
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:14,860
Of exp of R right which is basically this function, but when we plug in one so exp of R times one

542
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,540
if you prefer to think of it that way and

543
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:24,420
That is being represented by our green line and what you could see is okay if I get R that

544
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,160
Factor in front of X in my exponential function exp of R X to be zero point six nine

545
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,220
Which I know is around the natural log of two what this means is that?

546
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,400
X of one is about two and so this corresponds with the function that we would usually write as two to the power X

547
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,460
right

548
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,140
Okay, and basically as I change around my R

549
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,260
You know I could try to change it to something so that it looks like three so around one point one

550
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,860
That exponential looks like three which we would usually write as three to the power X

551
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,020
I would like to argue that it's a little bit healthier to think about

552
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,900
Varying this value R

553
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:08,100
rather than varying the base and the main reason is that as soon as we get to complex contexts, and we're thinking of

554
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,820
exponentiation

555
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,300
You have this overloading that goes on where if we change around what sits in front of the X

556
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,940
That's all well and good. I could have exp of R times X where maybe R is something like zero point six nine

557
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,720
But I could shift that down by two pi I

558
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,640
And that doesn't change the base that it would correspond to that would still correspond to two

559
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:35,000
Or it could shift it up by two pi I that doesn't change the base that it corresponds to because in all of those cases

560
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,560
When we plug in X equals one we get the same thing however

561
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,560
All of these for different values of X are distinct functions

562
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,240
This is why we saw multiple different values for I to the power I

563
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,720
Because I to the X is an ambiguous function in that context it would be unambiguous if we decided which value of R

564
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,560
Such that what we're representing is exp of R times X which value of R. Do we choose as soon as we choose one?

565
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
It's an unambiguous function

566
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,520
but at that point it just feels like maybe what we want is a

567
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,040
To stop thinking about things in terms of some base raised to the power X

568
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,840
Maybe as soon as we're in the context of complex numbers

569
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,960
We should just write them all as exp of some constant times X if for no other reason it makes crystal clear

570
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,120
How we actually plug in numbers if we want to do a computation or just to do math on top of it

571
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,200
we've got this nice infinite polynomial that we plug them into and

572
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,960
I'll make another case for you that this is this is maybe the the correct way to think about exponentials

573
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,920
As soon as we're extending into other domains things like complex numbers and for that let's just let's just back up

574
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,960
Go back to doorbell some things arrived go back to the original

575
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,760
Way that we extend the idea of exponentiation and just think of like what is 2 to the X

576
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,960
Right we know how to think about this for natural numbers. You know something like 2 to the 3

577
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,760
Repeated multiplication

578
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,800
How is it that you're first taught to think about something like 2 to the X for fractional amounts or

579
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,920
For negative amounts and things like that. Well. You're usually taught that

580
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,360
2 to the 1 half

581
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
should be something where

582
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,880
you know if I multiply it by itself and

583
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
This follows the usual rules that

584
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,480
Exponentials do with counting numbers where we're able to add things in that exponent

585
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,520
I should get 2 to the 1 so it should be some number that when I multiply it by itself I get 2 and

586
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,200
You know at that point you have a choice, maybe it's positive. Maybe it's negative

587
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,920
But if you always decide to make the positive choice

588
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,420
You're going to be able to get a nice continuous function out of this same deal if we ask about negative numbers

589
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,100
What should 2 to the negative 1 be well that should be something where when I multiply it by 2 to the 1?

590
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:52,400
It gets me 2 to the 0 and that's kind of the justification for our convention that negative exponents look like 1 half

591
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,680
But what's really going on here is we're saying whatever this is it should be some kind of function

592
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,300
That satisfies this property f of a plus b

593
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
equals f of a times f of b and

594
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,040
Moreover the fact that the base is 2 is basically telling us that it's not just any such function

595
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,060
It's a function where when we plug in 1 we get 2

596
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,640
And just as a little you know sanity check style question to see if you're following along with some of the implications here

597
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,240
I want to ask you what is

598
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,560
I won't call it like a softball, but this is this isn't meant to be like

599
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,600
An incredibly deep question necessarily. It's just more of a check if you're following along with

600
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,940
The idea of abstractly starting with properties of a function and then kind of deducing ways that we might want to write it down

601
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,600
based on those properties

602
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:49,760
If f of x satisfies this exponential property f of a plus b equals f of a times f of b for all inputs

603
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,800
And it also satisfies f of 1 equals 2 which of the following is true

604
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,640
Which is to say which of the following is necessarily true

605
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:04,240
No matter which such function you're starting with and those of you who remember which which lecture was it

606
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,120
It's whichever one we were talking about how to interpret what Euler's formula is really saying

607
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,140
I asked a question of this style where I neglected a single condition, you know

608
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:19,120
I didn't write down the fact that we want to make sure f of x is nonzero everywhere and then that caused some amount of

609
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,740
Confudlement which is cool get confudlement on screen that happens to all of us

610
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:30,220
But the the intent of it was to basically show that this abstract property of something that turns addition into multiplication is

611
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:39,580
Is enough to basically make you want to write the function as whatever it equals as one raised to some kind of power

612
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,960
This is the the spirit of the question

613
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:51,900
Now we've got a couple questions actually about power towers that seem to have popped up here which is great connected to last time

614
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:59,820
Let's let's hold off on the power tower question for just a moment so that we first get like a deeper feel of like

615
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,200
What exponentiation should mean here?

616
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,100
Because because we can be what I want to claim is we can answer it in like multiple different ways

617
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,780
So if you give me just one, we'll talk about power towers

618
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:16,440
And then just as a number line can be represented in a logarithmic scale can the same done be done for a complex plane?

619
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,440
Maybe mapping the complex plane onto an infinite cylinder in the logarithmic. That's yeah. Yeah

620
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:28,520
In fact, there's a visualization that I'm going to get to in just a moment here where we do something quite similar to that

621
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,700
Because what we'll do is play around with different exponential functions X of R times X

622
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,180
But we're going to change that value of R which is going to be represented by a little yellow dot

623
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,540
So we'll kind of talk through this

624
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,540
It's not going to map the whole plane, but just a couple sample points from the real axis and the imaginary axis

625
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,420
But the idea is that as we move around what that constant is

626
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:53,940
We're going to be able to kind of visualize the different things that it does to the plane and

627
00:48:54,300 --> 00:49:00,460
Effectively it's like it's turning the x-axis into a logarithmic scale and then wrapping the imaginary axis along a circle

628
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,580
And then as soon as that value of R becomes imaginary it swaps the role of those

629
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,320
Real numbers get put on the circle and imaginary numbers get put on a logarithmic scaled

630
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,640
Positive axis so great question all three of which I guess are sort of jumping the gun ahead for where I want to go

631
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,560
But nice to see that's where people are thinking so in this one. Let's go ahead and just grade it

632
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,480
the idea is that

633
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,200
this this property of f of a plus B ends up letting you express a lot of different things purely in terms of

634
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,880
What f of 1 is and just to spell that out very?

635
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,440
explicitly

636
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,660
Something like f of 5 is the same thing as f of 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1

637
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:49,300
Which is the same thing as f of 1 multiplied by itself 5 times because of this property

638
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,700
Which if f of 1 is 2 is the same as 2 to the power 5 and then something like f of negative 5

639
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,860
It should be the case that when we multiply it by f of 5

640
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:10,220
We get whatever f of 0 is and it's not immediately clear what f of 0 is but we could say that f of 1 plus 0 is

641
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:17,540
Equal to whatever f of 1 is times what f of 0 is but f of 1 is equal to 2

642
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,620
And so this is also equal to 2 so we're saying 2 is equal to 2 times something well that something has to be a 1

643
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,380
so in this context this guarantees that f of negative 5 is

644
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,460
2 to the negative 5 it's 1 over 2 to the 5th

645
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,640
We could explicitly write this as 2 to the negative 5 which is all to say

646
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,760
These two properties together make us really want to write the function as

647
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,360
2 to the X

648
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,220
Because any counting number that we put in it's going to satisfy

649
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,100
It's it's going to look like to multiply by itself that number of times any fractional number

650
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,760
We put in it's going to satisfy these properties that we wanted

651
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,760
And you might wonder is that unique and in the context of real valued functions it actually would be

652
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,520
But in the context of complex valued functions

653
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,520
There would be multiple such functions f that we could write for this one of which is what we were looking at before

654
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,820
Where we could have a function defined to be

655
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
exp of

656
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
the natural log of 2

657
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
plus 2 pi I

658
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
all of that times X

659
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,000
Okay, forgive the sloppiness here, I just get excited writing about this

660
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,680
And this is actually a different function as evidenced by what happens if you plug in X equals 1 half

661
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,320
We saw a little bit earlier how when you plug in 1 half what you get is the negative square root of 2

662
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,000
and then if you plug in 1 fourth you get

663
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,540
Not the fourth root of 2 but I times the fourth root of 2 so it is a different function

664
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,500
But it still satisfies these properties and it kind of makes us want to write it as 2 to the X

665
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,880
And it makes it suggest that maybe 2 to the X is an ambiguous bit of notation

666
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,800
And we should just write everything in terms of exp of R times something but you might wonder well

667
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,060
You know maybe we're just not being creative enough with all of the functions that satisfy this property

668
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,860
Maybe there's an ambiguity when we write exp of R times something and there's different values of R that could come into play

669
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,340
But I'm I'm just gonna put down a little claim and then maybe give like a sketch of what the proof would look like if you want

670
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,360
Which is that let's say you have some complex function F, and it satisfies the following properties first

671
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:29,440
You're able to take a derivative of it. It's differentiable which just keeps it from being some you know totally messy discontinuous thing

672
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,380
That's like taking on some random values depending on you know the span of whatever vector space over

673
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,420
I don't know fractional amounts you might want to think of in crazy ways. It's a nice function. That's differentiable

674
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
It's not equal to 0 everywhere

675
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,400
so the condition that sort of slipped my mind and I

676
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:54,120
Forget which lecture lecture for or something like that and then it has this central property that it turns addition into multiplication

677
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,880
If you have such a function I claim that there's a unique maybe I should really specify there exists a unique

678
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,840
Complex number R so that you could write F of X as basically being this exponential function of R times that value X

679
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,360
Which is you know basically saying that if you have X as a function this

680
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,400
infinite polynomial with nice derivative properties and all of that if you have this you have

681
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,960
Every exponential that you want in a very like abstract generic sense of the word exponential just based on a property that we could want

682
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,360
from it and the sketch of the proof would look something like this if

683
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,480
You want to first look at what is the derivative of this value which we're assuming exists everywhere, right?

684
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,240
And you explicitly write out what the limit of that is

685
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,840
I'll just talk through it very quickly here for those who want to like pause and think through the details feel free to

686
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,720
the central property that we have lets us

687
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,440
Expand out the F of X plus H term

688
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,940
So we're thinking you know a change slight change to the output over the change to the input that caused it. That's what DF DX

689
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,660
unwraps to and

690
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:07,680
Because we can factor that out. We can factor F of X out of the expression entirely and the whole limit is

691
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
expressed only in terms of H

692
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,160
Which if you think about what it means in the context of derivatives and the fact that F of 0 necessarily equals 1

693
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,560
This whole limiting expression

694
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,660
Is just some constant but more specifically it's whatever the derivative of our function at 0 is

695
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,840
So you have this funny thing where if you know its derivative at 0 that determines what its derivative is everywhere

696
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,080
And in the context of exponential functions

697
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,640
this is hopefully quite familiar because all that we're really saying is the derivative of an exponential function is

698
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:44,800
Proportional to itself and that proportionality constant is equal to whatever the derivative at 0 is this is all very

699
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,420
Abstractly phrased and such but but the purpose of it is to emphasize that it's not

700
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,900
necessarily just functions that we already think of as a to the power X

701
00:54:52,960 --> 00:55:00,080
But it is a potentially much more broad class of functions that just satisfy this abstract property of turning addition into multiplication

702
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,440
But if you have that it actually guarantees that you also have a second derivative

703
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,040
And for that matter a third derivative and such because the derivative function is just proportional to itself

704
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,000
So in order to take the nth derivative you just look at

705
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,160
That proportionality constant and raise it to the power n and then from here

706
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,400
You could do a Taylor series expansion and I might leave that as sort of the advanced homework for those of you who are comfortable

707
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
with Taylor series in that idea

708
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,880
especially if you want to intermix the idea of any

709
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:39,000
Differentiable function that's differentiable in a sense of complex numbers, which is sort of a definitely college topic

710
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,280
You know you you could intermix the reasoning there as you want

711
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,400
But fuzzy reasoning is allowed in the context of someone who only knows about Taylor series and nothing else

712
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,880
to take this idea and look at the Taylor expansion for F and kind of justify the idea that

713
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:00,120
There's a unique complex number such that our function F can necessarily be written like this

714
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,680
And then the connection to normal exponentials is whenever you have such a value R

715
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,800
We do essentially what we do in the complex context of real numbers is if you look at exp of that function of that value R

716
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,760
and

717
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,880
Write that as a base. It feels like you should be able to write that as B to the X

718
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,680
But the whole the whole point here of course is that when we play this game

719
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,240
And you're trying to interpret something like I to the X that's an ambiguous function

720
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,160
Because there's lots of different values of R. We could interpret that to mean not just

721
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,580
exp of pi halves I times X, but we could also interpret it to mean

722
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,640
exp of 5 pi halves I

723
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,080
Times X and

724
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,440
These are separate functions

725
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,160
And there's an infinite family of separate functions that feel like we should write them as I to the X

726
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,800
So the expression I to the I unless you've adopted a standard for what that's necessarily going to mean

727
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,880
When you say it has infinitely many outputs another way to think of that is that

728
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,720
The function I to the X with the notation we have is a little bit ambiguous

729
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,600
Now with all of that let's let's just start visualizing some of this because I think that's fun

730
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,080
And you know you you tell me if this is if this is a helpful visual or a more confusing visual

731
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,880
but what we're going to do is look at this function exp of R times X, which is

732
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,680
Basically this is another way to write e to the power of X in fact

733
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,800
I think I I think I rendered a different animation at some point that specified that because I was planning on

734
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,220
Planning on doing that so let me oh yeah there you are get back in my file system get back to where you're supposed to

735
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,220
be

736
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,040
Get on in there is it complaining because there's multiple different

737
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,120
It's gonna be like there's a Oh replace it shows up on the other screen

738
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Wait why is it yeah, okay replace?

739
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,640
Place whatever you see there

740
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,700
And now we go back to oh there we all of that all of that just so that I could have nicely written out

741
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,160
If you're uncomfortable with thinking of it as exp of R times X this infinite polynomial

742
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,540
Just in the back of your head e to the R times X and we're gonna vary around R

743
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,880
so I'm gonna follow the points of the imaginary axis, and I'm gonna follow the points of the real axis and

744
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,520
Let's see what this does

745
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,640
Well that's all kind of fast so let me think through it a little bit more slowly all of the negative numbers anything

746
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,080
That's a negative real number is going to get squished into the range between 0 and 1

747
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,360
Which should make sense e to the negative?

748
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,580
a to a negative real number is something between 0 and 1 and we're

749
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:42,280
Specifically tracking f of negative 1 which is going to show up around whatever 1 over e is around 30 0.37

750
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,400
f of 1 lands on e as

751
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Expected that's what exp of 1 is

752
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,260
f of I is gonna land one radian around the unit circle, and it's kind of fun to follow along the whole

753
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,680
imaginary axis here how the imaginary axis gets

754
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,240
wrapped around a circle and

755
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,040
What happens as we tweak this value of R?

756
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,080
That's determining not just that we're talking about an exponential function, but which exponential function

757
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:14,080
There's a nice one-to-one correspondence between all the exponential functions. We might want and values of R here

758
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,140
It stretches things differently so when we put it up to 2

759
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:23,080
You know it stretches out the real axis a lot more so that f of 1 ends up around where e squared is a little

760
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:28,440
Above 7 f of negative 1 is much closer to 0 f of I is a 2 radian

761
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,720
Rotation around the circle f of negative I is a negative 2 radian rotation

762
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:39,640
And of course we can get to our favorite formula that if that were pi that we had as our scaling constant

763
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,700
Then the real axis gets stretched out quite a lot

764
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:47,500
You know f of 1 is sitting off at e to the pi which is very close to 20 plus pi

765
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:53,120
Which is always fun and f of negative 1 extremely close to 0 so it's really stretched out that real axis

766
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:58,160
And it's also stretched out things in the unit circle direction so that

767
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:04,720
Getting to f of I or f of negative I walks halfway around the circle, so that's all well and good now

768
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
How would we think about a function like?

769
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,560
2 to the X which is what?

770
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
We would also write as X of

771
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:19,520
X of the natural log of 2 times X so we kind of move our yellow dot representing the value of R

772
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,920
To around 0.69 still no imaginary part just a real number 0.69 or so

773
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,280
That's the natural log of 2 well you can see that f of 1 lands on 2

774
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,920
Which is why we want to call this function 2 to the X

775
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:37,380
f of 1 half actually sorry f of negative 1 lands right on 1 half f of I

776
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:43,980
It's some walk around the unit circle very specifically it's going to be 0.69 radians around the unit circle and

777
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:51,340
Now we could have a little bit more fun and say what would happen if we were to change this to instead of being

778
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,760
0.69 instead of being the natural log of 2 make it I times the natural log of 2 so that we're really thinking of

779
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:03,060
Something that might have an exponential base to it. This would be what we might think of is 2 times I

780
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,960
Raised to a power

781
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:14,540
Well if we move that yellow dot which is representing R off of the real axis and onto the imaginary axis it swaps the roles

782
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,660
of

783
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,740
the

784
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:23,500
teal dots and all of the maroon dots in this context which remember came from being the positive and imaginary axes and it should make

785
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,380
Sense that it swaps their roles because what does it mean if we take the input space and we multiply it by I?

786
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,940
It means we're rotating that input space so everything that was the real number axis

787
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:37,680
Turns into the imaginary axis and everything that was the imaginary axis is getting turned into the real axis

788
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,780
So for us what that means is our new exponential function where our value of R is now purely imaginary

789
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,580
Takes all of the real numbers

790
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,620
And it just wraps them around a circle and it takes all the imaginary numbers, and it's putting them onto the real number line

791
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:57,280
So in particular let's say we scale this thing up so that we're sitting at around pi halves times I

792
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,340
Well, what does that actually mean that means it takes the real number one?

793
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:06,540
To the value I which is the sense in which we want to write this function as I to the power X

794
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:10,240
Right it just tempts us to write it not as this abstract looking thing

795
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:16,020
X of R times X where R is equal to pi halves I don't know we just want to write it as I to the X

796
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,060
Even if that's a little ambiguous

797
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,500
what that really means is just that the function we're dealing with outputs I at 1 and

798
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,020
if it's an exponential function that

799
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,500
And we're asking what does it do to the value I?

800
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:35,300
What is I to the power I in this case it shoves it to around 0.2 around a fifth

801
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:40,680
But there's many different exponential functions that would have this property of putting f of 1 onto the number I

802
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,280
So if we were to scale it up even further

803
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,880
I don't think I have it animated here

804
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,340
But if we were to take that yellow dot and raise it up until it got to 5 halves times pi I

805
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,420
What you would see is that the unit circle?

806
01:02:53,300 --> 01:03:00,240
Is rotated around on itself so that f of negative f of 1 would rotate around another 2 pi radians and land where it is

807
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,740
But it would stretch out the real axis a lot more

808
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:07,840
Which was the sense in which another output of I to the I is a much much smaller number

809
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,620
It was around what was it 0.0003 or so

810
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,300
But we can also see what I think is quite fun

811
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:20,860
What happens if we consider alternate expressions that we want to interpret as 2 to the power X right?

812
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:27,000
So when R is a purely real number the natural log of 2 kind of makes sense that when you plug it in here

813
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,220
The expression we get is what we want to write as 2 to the power X

814
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:37,500
But what if we start moving it in the imaginary direction? Okay, and what I'll first do is I'll move it up by pi I units

815
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,420
Now what's going on here?

816
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:46,540
We have X of R times X and R is equal to this value, which is the natural log of 2 plus pi times I

817
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,380
What that means is that when we plug in 1

818
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,940
f of 1 is at negative 2 so we want to write this function as negative 2 to the power X

819
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,340
right and that's actually something that

820
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:03,540
You know, it's it's a little deceptively simple when we write a negative number to a power

821
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,880
Negative 2

822
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,320
To the power X it doesn't at first look like this necessarily it brings us into the complex numbers in any way

823
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,580
but of course when we plug in even a value like

824
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,260
1 half

825
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:22,220
Where we're kind of asking for a square root of negative 2 we realize that we want to write this as something like I

826
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,540
times the square root of 2

827
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:30,620
But if you were to look at this function negative 2 to the power X in the full complex domain that it's dealing with

828
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:34,560
What you're looking at is a function that takes the value of 1 to negative 2

829
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:39,680
And if it does that what it does to the rest of the real number line is it kind of spirals it outward?

830
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,040
So we see that f of negative 1 sits at negative 1 half

831
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,640
About where you would expect if you were to follow to f of 1 half

832
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,800
It would sit exactly on the imaginary line and f of 1 half would be square root of 2

833
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,760
Well, my mouse is not where I want it to be. It would be around square root of 2

834
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,320
times I and

835
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:06,840
As you continue further on this is showing you all of the real value powers of negative 2 to the X it necessarily

836
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,960
spirals around

837
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,240
But we could also move our value of R even higher and get it up to around tau times I around six point two eight times

838
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,480
I and in that context this is another function that we would want to write as something like 2 to the X

839
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,200
because

840
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,180
For any whole number to whole number that you plug in for X it will look like repeated multiplication

841
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:35,400
And it even has kind of reasonable values for things like 1 half where it spits out the negative square root instead of a positive

842
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,760
Square root, but what it's actually doing is a transformation to the plane

843
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:43,080
Where it puts everything is the real number line ends up being a very tightly wound

844
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,440
Spiral that goes around and it just spirals in such a way that f of 1 lands right on the number 2

845
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,000
So it is in that sense that we could say

846
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,620
2 to the X is

847
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:00,600
Is plausibly interpreted as a separate exponential function from the one that we are traditionally used to

848
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,480
So I think with all of that I will I will leave things for today

849
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,000
And I'll just leave you with a couple lingering questions to think about okay, so

850
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:17,260
If you want to think of I to the I as being a multi-valued expression right you could you could say we adopt a convention

851
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,960
Fancifully you'd say you choose a branch of the natural logarithm function

852
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,520
And maybe that locks you into this being e to the negative pi halves

853
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,860
But if you say this kind of wants to be infinitely many different values like the various ones that we saw

854
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,020
How many values does 2 to the 1 third want to be in the same sense?

855
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,860
Where we are replacing 2 with various different

856
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,280
various different options for e to the X

857
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:48,940
Such that e to the X equals 2 how many different values does that want to be or how many values does 2 to the 3?

858
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,940
10ths want to be

859
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:55,840
Phrased differently of all of the let me say of all of the exponential functions

860
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,400
F of X which satisfy oh have I written it down somewhere

861
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,340
f of X that satisfies

862
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,500
All of these properties that I've written so if it satisfies all of these

863
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,460
and if f of 1 is equal to 2

864
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:20,340
Right how many different outputs are we going to get when we plug in X equals 3 10ths for the various options for what function?

865
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,480
That is and how many outputs are we going to get?

866
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:30,000
For 2 to the pi for the various functions that 2 to the X could represent if we're thinking of 2 to the X as some

867
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,740
kind of exponential function

868
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,740
Exponential in the sense of these sort of abstract properties

869
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,540
and

870
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,500
if we

871
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
yeah, if we if we have a

872
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,420
Class of different such functions, and we want to plug in pi it makes me laugh

873
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:49,400
Just because it's such a I know kind of a funny answer that pops out as you're trying to think about it

874
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:54,780
so those are the questions that I'll leave you with and I think this is you know my

875
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,580
My central question in approaching today's lecture was whether I wanted it to be

876
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,420
Kind of describing like these abstract properties of exponential functions

877
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:10,320
And it's just cool to me that starting from those abstract properties you get locked into the idea of e to the rx or more

878
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,880
Just you know I think more honestly written exp of r times x for different values of r

879
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,740
That it locks you in that far

880
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,660
But it doesn't lock you in as far as having an unambiguous

881
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,360
Notion of what 2 to the power x should be much less something like I to the power x

882
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:28,720
The risk in that of course is that sometimes people don't love abstraction and sometimes

883
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,900
It doesn't come off as approachable

884
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:38,160
But if that's the case you know you just let me know I think I think there's a whole interesting circle of thoughts that surrounds

885
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,340
All of this stuff to include power towers because if you want to

886
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,520
Actually talk about power towers like we were last time in the context of complex numbers or even with negative bases

887
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,340
You have to be thinking through things like this, so it was a question that we had up on screen

888
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,240
Yeah, what happens if we do this for I to the power I?

889
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,680
Titration you know let's just try this let's just go ahead and try a power tower

890
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:06,000
Where we're raising I to a given power and see what what pops out of it, so it wasn't planning on doing this

891
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,340
But we can we can always pull up Python and essentially do what we were doing last time

892
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,920
So the way that this would work is we were starting off with some base value and then for some kind of range

893
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:24,760
What were we doing we were taking a and we're going to reassign it to be whatever

894
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,820
The base which in this case is I raised to the power of a should be

895
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,920
Okay, cool, so we're going to do that and then we're going to print off the value of a let's just do this for

896
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,760
Yeah, it's a much bigger number like 200

897
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,640
So it seems like what happens is

898
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:52,160
There's potential for chaos with these things like sometimes. It's not that you've landed on a stable a

899
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:58,440
Stable value or it's not even that you've diverged it could be that you're bouncing between a cycle of values or

900
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,000
That you're like literally bouncing in a way. That's it's not periodic or anything and it's actually chaotic I

901
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,600
Suspect that doesn't happen for I but it's a thing to potentially look out for it looks like it does kind of stabilize

902
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,400
Maybe there's some little subjection to numerical error

903
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:23,320
But we stay pretty consistently around something with a real part of 0.43 and 0.36

904
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,720
Now what I would want to emphasize though is this expression

905
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,360
So let's set a back to be equal to 1 this expression of taking I to the power of a remember

906
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:37,640
That's a little bit ambiguous. It depends on what choice of the function. I we actually have so let me let me import

907
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,640
NumPy so I have the exponential function let me go

908
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,320
For our big range like we had before

909
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,280
Rather than writing it as you know something that's like I to the power of X

910
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,280
I'm gonna write it as the exponential function of a different constant

911
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,280
right a

912
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,840
Different constant that I'm gonna make I want it to be 5 pi halves, so I'll do 5

913
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,040
pi

914
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,360
halves times I so it's a complex number and

915
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,360
It's got 5 pi halves as the imaginary part

916
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,000
So this is 5 pi halves times I and what am I doing?

917
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I'm exponentiating that so I want to multiply a onto the inside there, okay?

918
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,220
This is basically another way that you could interpret the expression I to the X

919
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,380
Thankfully you would say you've chosen a different branch of the natural log function

920
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,520
But it is another function which we could iterate on itself and see what happens and we might get a different result

921
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,900
Very interesting okay, so we actually have a different result. It looks like what ends up happening is it bounces between two values

922
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,140
Oh

923
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:47,740
Wow is it period three that's interesting period three implies chaos, so we've got seven point three five then zero then point nine nine

924
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:53,560
So it looks like it gets into the cycle of bouncing between three separate values even though

925
01:11:54,860 --> 01:12:01,320
In theory in both of those cases we were doing something that was I to the X iterated on itself it has everything to do

926
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:06,400
With what actual function you think I to the X is referring to so in that sense

927
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
The power tower question is ambiguous

928
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,200
Usually you just choose it to be the pi halves I variant, but it's more fun to see that it can be multiple things all right

929
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,920
We have addition multiplication exponentiation titration can we think of something in between?

930
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,120
halfway between multiplication and exponentiation oh

931
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,440
that's an

932
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,200
I mean

933
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,140
I love the spirit of it because each one of them it comes down to like a discrete step of

934
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:35,680
You're repeating the previous operation, but oftentimes in math when you have something initially defined in terms of repetition like

935
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,920
Exponentiation you can extend it beyond that I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but that's an interesting question

936
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,920
I don't know if that's been

937
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:49,200
That's an extended notion. I mean you have things like fractional derivatives you have things like fractional and complex exponents

938
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,880
So it doesn't seem outlandish

939
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,880
But I'm not familiar with one myself

940
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,800
And then lastly do complex numbers to the power of complex number values arise in physics, and if yes

941
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,420
How does one decide which values are valid so I?

942
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,620
Can't think of if they necessary that's right scene switching. I can't think of if they

943
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,720
Come up in physics in like a direct sense, and this is probably just because I'm not a physicist so I

944
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,800
Would say like ask ask your neighborhood physicist and see see what they have to say

945
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,860
I mean clearly

946
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:23,840
The point of teaching the lesson here is that the thoughts that you have to go through to make sense out of it do build

947
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,160
a stronger relationship with exponentials things like it's not just more natural to represent them as e to the rx

948
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:35,100
Once you get to complex numbers you kind of have to represent them that way whereas previously in like physics or other real-world contexts

949
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,100
It's something that's just nice
