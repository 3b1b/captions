00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
Welcome back to what is now the second to last in the Lockdown Math series.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,960
So we've been talking a lot about exponential functions and complex numbers and the interplay of the two of them,

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,820
and I thought what might be a very nice culminating topic to help bring it all together and show really the full breadth of what

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,240
exponential functions are and what they can be would be to talk about raising i to the power i.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,800
Now this is a, this is a funny little expression because

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,680
usually if we think about powers, if we were doing something like i to the fourth,

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,200
you know, we know how to think about it in terms of repeated multiplication. We're just multiplying something by itself four different times.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,620
And in general you'd like to think of i to the x as some variant of that,

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,900
but as soon as x becomes a complex number, we should realize that it's really nothing

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,280
like the above. So it's really nothing like this.

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,340
Instead,

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,120
the way that we think about it is going to have to be very related to the way that we think about raising e

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,360
to various different numbers, e being that kind of home base for us. And in fact if we go,

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,480
oh no, that's not sure where things are going too much here,

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,020
if we go ahead and rewrite that base i in terms of e,

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,200
it can help us make sense out of this expression. But I don't want to do that,

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,780
I want you to do that for me. So if you head on over to 3b1b.co.live, link is in the description,

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,040
it'll forward you on over to item pool,

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,080
which now asks us

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,880
write a value of x so that e to the x is equal to i.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,180
That way we'll be able to replace it in the base of our expression.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,720
And then once we do that, maybe we can use our knowledge of e and

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,320
exponentials of e in order to make some sense out of this expression. Now

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,540
let me just add as a quick reminder while everyone is rolling in with answers for that, that when we write e to the x

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,500
and complex numbers are in the mix, we are no longer talking about repeated multiplication.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,840
And instead I think the healthiest way to think about it is that e to the x is a shorthand for this

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,740
polynomial that I might call exp. It's the, it's sort of the main exponential function. All other exponential functions derive from this

28
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,780
in a way that I'll describe later on in this episode actually.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,740
And it's, it's a lovely polynomial.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,600
It's 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6. Each term looks like a power of x divided by

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,760
the factorial of that power.

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,460
So the reason for doing that is then it can actually make sense to plug in things like complex values.

33
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,260
And one of the things that we looked at earlier in the series was how if you're plugging in imaginary values,

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,240
you know, let's say I go over here and I'm going to plug in i,

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,380
where i is the square root of negative 1 times some value theta,

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,920
we can very literally read off what it means to exponentiate it in that context.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,900
For example, this very first term 1 we might think of as a vector pointing from 0 to 1.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,780
The next term, which is some scaled version of i, well, it's a 90 degree rotation of that first vector scaled a little bit differently.

39
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,260
Then the next vector is a 90 degree rotation of that scaled differently. And depending on what this value theta equals,

40
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,140
the way that these things scale is going to look very different.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,440
And it's in general a difficult thing to think about, but it's at least a sensible thing to think about, right?

42
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,320
So that when we go to our expression,

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,140
e to the x, and we're going to start thinking about i in various complex numbers, it makes sense computationally what it means.

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,280
And then there's going to be a separate illustration that I'll pull up in a moment for how it makes sense in terms of intuition

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,200
what it means.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,220
But first let's just see how people are doing on our live quiz, finding a value of x so that e to the x is equal to i.

47
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,580
Now.

48
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,040
How have people done here?

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,340
Okay, so the top answer is in a sense absolutely correct, you could say. By definition,

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,280
the natural log is the inverse function of exponentiation.

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,900
So whatever the answer is here, we should be able to write it as natural log of i. The problem is that's not really helpful.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,140
It's not going to move us forward,

53
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,840
because if we if we tried to use that, you know, we pop over here and we say instead of writing i,

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm going to write e to the natural log of i,

55
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,940
and then I'm going to be raising that to some kind of power.

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,540
It begs the question, and the only thing I can really do from here is simplify that down to be i,

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,360
which sort of gets us nowhere. So to move forward and to think is there a number,

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,940
some concrete point on the plane that I can plug in,

59
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,400
for that we'd want to look at,

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,060
I accidentally skipped ahead of my questions here.

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,240
Let me go back, pull up people's answers.

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Got a little excited, a little trigger happy with some of my clicking around here.

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,380
And the second most common answer is something that's going to actually help us move forward here, which was one half of i times pi.

64
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,780
And then that's the same as what was written, what was categorized as the third most common one, one half pi times

65
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,640
i, just swapping the two numbers there.

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,600
And

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,040
I think, yeah, I think the one following that, I'm guessing people either forgot to mention the i,

68
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,720
but let's just write that out and kind of see where this moves us. One half i times pi.

69
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,860
Now, if you're confused about where that came from, I think this is a good time to remind ourselves of

70
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,660
Euler's formula and what it's really saying.

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,920
It's one half pi times i, where again,

72
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,580
computationally, this very literally means if we plug in pi over two for theta here, which would be something like

73
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,560
1.57 or so. Let me see if I can, I don't think I'll be able to get it right on the head,

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,440
but something in the 1.57 range,

75
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,480
if you were to play out this whole sum,

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,880
the claim of saying that e to the pi halves i equals i,

77
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,900
is that when you play all of this out and you add all of the terms together, you're going to get to the top here.

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,060
But usually this is kind of a complicated way to think about it.

79
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,900
People don't want to pull up this whole polynomial and imagine the spiraling sum.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,120
I think it's helpful just in case you find yourself doubting the reality of what we're talking about or the fact that it's something sensible.

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,540
Almost always, anytime that people are thinking about complex exponentials, instead they find themselves thinking something like

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,280
e to the i times theta,

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,960
they just immediately know of, maybe not immediately, but you come to immediately know of Euler's formula, that it's telling you you walk a distance theta

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,700
around the unit circle, which is to say an angle of theta radians,

85
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,460
and whatever point you're sitting at on the complex plane, that's the output.

86
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,140
So people who knew about this would say, hmm, i as a number is also sitting on the unit circle,

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,580
so I just have to walk an angle of 90 degrees pi halves radians.

88
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,140
And from here we can actually move forward and get kind of a funny looking answer,

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,860
because that i will hop to the inside and we'll be looking at e to the pi halves times i squared.

90
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,060
i squared is negative one by definition. So this looks like e to the negative pi halves.

91
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,160
That is a purely real number. You could just plug that into your calculator and it's actually around

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,800
0.2 or so.

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,460
It's about a fifth, which is weird,

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,740
uh, that you take an imaginary number and raise it to an imaginary power and that gets you a real number.

95
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,400
Um, maybe it feels a little bit weird that e and pi have shown up, not that much if we're thinking in terms of

96
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,920
Euler's formula and all of that, but

97
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,200
I kind of want to go deeper on this one, right?

98
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,880
I think it's one thing to plug in some numbers and see what pops out.

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
And there's a couple great videos who have talked about i to the i from some of my favorite channels.

100
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,840
Stand Up Math with Matt Parker, he talked about i to the i, did a beautiful job.

101
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,920
Black Pin Red Pin did another i to the i video, truly great.

102
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,600
One thing that I try to,

103
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,240
you know, I try to do is add something into the mix if I'm talking about a topic that others already have.

104
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,460
And in this case, I think one of the most interesting questions you can ask before we jump in,

105
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,900
I mean, there's lots of interesting things about this expression i to the i,

106
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,000
but if we're seeking intuition, thinking about how i is a 90 degree rotation,

107
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,020
right, that's the way that it acts when we're multiplying things on the complex plane.

108
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:57,740
We think of it very intuitively as the thing that upon multiplication turns stuff 90 degrees, or pi halves radians.

109
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,600
So when you look at this expression that i to the power i equals e to the negative pi halves,

110
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,240
it begs the question, in what sense do two 90 degree rotations combine to make this real number,

111
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,900
this very specific real number of e to the negative pi halves around 0.2079, on and on?

112
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,160
And it's like those games that sometimes you play with arithmetic where someone says,

113
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,000
oh, I'll give you the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6, see if you can combine them in some way with addition,

114
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,960
multiplication, division, to get some other specific number, like 24, in that case is a particularly fun puzzle.

115
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,320
In this case, it's kind of like that style of puzzle on steroids. How do we take the idea of a 90 degree rotation and

116
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,760
combine it with itself twice in some mathematical sense such that we get out this number e to the negative pi halves?

117
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,420
Where's that intuition coming from?

118
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,760
And the first step, I would say,

119
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,860
is to remind ourselves of the intuition for why it is that Euler's formula works,

120
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,220
why it is that I can take an expression like e to the pi halves i and say that that's the same thing as i.

121
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,760
You know, I just showed what it means in a very, um,

122
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,880
computational sense, what the claim is with this spiraling sum, but that tells us nothing about why,

123
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,480
why it would be the case that this is how things behave.

124
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,920
Now I've at this point made, you know, quite a number of videos on variants of this,

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,620
but I think the quickest one is to think of it dynamically somehow.

126
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,860
So if we take an expression like e to the i times t and we're thinking of that as describing a dynamic,

127
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,960
you're going to have a position that changes over time,

128
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,400
then what I'll do is I'm going to start drawing that with a blue vector, and we know as an initial condition

129
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,100
that when we raise e to the zero, that's at one. So where we are at time t equals zero is equal to one,

130
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,940
but let's say that's all we know, right? We haven't been told about Euler's formula,

131
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,760
or how we should be thinking about it with circles or anything like that. That's just where we're starting.

132
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,980
Well, one thing we might know is that e to the x is its own derivative.

133
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,380
So if we're thinking of dynamics here, we might ask about the velocity of our position taking its derivative,

134
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,440
and

135
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,680
because e to the x is its own derivative, this is quite nice. The outer expression,

136
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,940
is going to stay the same, and then the inner expression as we're applying the chain rule is just i times t,

137
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,420
so we multiply the whole outer thing by i.

138
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,360
And this gives us a literal way to read

139
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,600
the equation in terms of dynamics, right? What we're saying is take whatever your position vector is,

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,480
if you rotate that 90 degrees, you apply this action of i, that's going to give you the velocity vector.

141
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,500
So wherever you're standing, draw a vector from zero, the origin, up to where you are, rotate that vector 90 degrees,

142
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,180
that gives you your velocity, and that's enough to tell you how to move, assuming you know where you're starting.

143
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,420
And of course we have to draw this out in the complex plane, the fact that we've rotated 90 degrees already brings us there,

144
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,280
and

145
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:57,460
I could draw out a bunch of different potential position vectors, you know,

146
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,400
and what it would tell you is, okay, I've got to sit there,

147
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,100
rotate my vector 90 degrees, that describes my velocity.

148
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,280
And it doesn't necessarily have to be any one of the points on that circle, any point in the plane,

149
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,120
if you're following this dynamic, you say rotate that vector 90 degrees, which if we're drawing a vector field,

150
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,420
we often scale down, and it's all well and good.

151
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,120
And here you could phrase this question without even talking about exponentials or complex numbers or anything like that,

152
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
and in fact I'm going to go back to the quiz just to

153
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,060
really

154
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,760
emphasize that Euler's formula and what it's claiming and then how we apply it to expressions like i to the power i,

155
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,800
it's very, it's really intuitive as soon as we're putting some dynamics into it, and we can ask questions removed from the idea of

156
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,180
exponentials that actually have the same substance in their answers.

157
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,640
So here I want you to imagine starting a walk from the point 1,0 on the coordinate plane,

158
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,380
in such a way that at all moments your velocity vector is a 90 degree

159
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,260
counterclockwise rotation of the vector drawn from 0,0, the origin, up to where you are.

160
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,680
After pi halves units of time, where will you be on the plane?

161
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,640
Okay, so kind of think about that, think about that dynamic and where you'll end up after a little bit of time.

162
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,560
While you answer, let me see if we have any questions that have popped in from the audience.

163
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:31,560
No questions at the moment, at least that I see, so if ever you do want to ask, go to Twitter, use the hashtag lockdownmath,

164
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,360
those will be forwarded to me and then sometimes they'll be on the screen that I can pull up here,

165
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,520
and that always makes for a fun time.

166
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,780
For example, it seems like now we actually have one, which is how about other solutions to the expression

167
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,980
x equals i, such as 5 pi halves? Oh, I'm so glad you asked, I'm so very glad you asked, we will certainly be talking about that.

168
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,760
And if you just hold on for like one little moment,

169
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,660
that's exactly what we're going to get to, so

170
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,540
I'll keep that on file for us to pull up

171
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,260
in a little moment. But right now while we're just trying to get intuition around the first,

172
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,840
you know, there will be multiple answers. The first answer we saw was e to the negative pi halves.

173
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,460
Let's

174
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,920
consider this lake question.

175
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,220
So it seems like

176
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,880
most of you correctly said that this would get you at the coordinates 0,1.

177
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,320
It's essentially walking you a quarter of the way around. I said lake question.

178
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,680
I'm sort of picturing in my head as a big circular lake that you're going for a walk around,

179
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:36,600
because when you have this rule for dynamics where your position vector rotated by 90 degrees gives you your velocity vector,

180
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,960
that is circular motion,

181
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,220
because the tangent line to a circle

182
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,260
is always perpendicular to its radius.

183
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,620
So this rule of motion corresponds with walking around a circle, and that's kind of the intuition for Euler's formula.

184
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,760
Right? That

185
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,920
you keep increasing that value of t, and this dynamical rule,

186
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,160
if e to the i t is going to behave according to the derivatives that we expect of a function like e to the t,

187
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,840
necessarily walks you around a circle. So in particular,

188
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,080
when we're wondering how long does it take to get to i,

189
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,360
you would basically say just wait for an amount of time equal to,

190
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,320
well, whatever the angle to get up there is, pi halves. Okay, so in this case we're thinking pi halves.

191
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Let me see if I can get it exactly on the dot. Okay, 1.57.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,420
We're thinking of pi halves as kind of an amount of time for these dynamics to get you on the number i.

193
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,540
And that gives us the first half of our intuition if we want to go back to our formula, and we're asking in what sense

194
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,420
do two 90 degree rotations combine to make e to the negative pi halves?

195
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
Once we're thinking of our dynamics here as

196
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,020
each one of your velocity vectors as a 90 degree rotation of your position,

197
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,560
this base i,

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,980
the way that we're kind of thinking about it reading it off as something with meaning rather than just a number,

199
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,460
is that as a point on the plane, it's where you get after traveling for pi halves units of time

200
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,920
according to the dynamics of this expression, according to the idea that your velocity is always a 90 degree rotation of your position.

201
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,820
Okay, so that's awfully nice. And in fact, there's already sort of two different i's at play here,

202
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,240
which, or I guess there's three different i's at play. We have this base,

203
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,800
which is describing the 90 degrees that we walk around the circle. We have the i that's sitting here, which is describing the rule of

204
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,480
rotating your velocity vector 90 degrees. But now we're going to introduce another i,

205
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,980
which essentially has this effect of changing what your dynamics are.

206
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,520
Because as we go from e to the i times t,

207
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,700
and instead we, you know, raise things to another power of i, which I'll just write with a little

208
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,880
caret i, if we take e to the i t and we alter what that expression is by raising it to the i,

209
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,080
what we get is e to the negative t.

210
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,020
Okay, so we have e to the negative t.

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,240
And if we try to interpret that with the same sort of dynamics that we had above in terms of a velocity and a position,

212
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,980
what that's telling us

213
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
is that the derivative

214
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,860
of our new dynamic e to the negative t is equal to,

215
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,620
well now the constant sitting in front of t is negative one, so our chain rule will have it be negative one times

216
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,220
itself,

217
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,680
times e to the negative t. So whatever your position is, now your velocity is negative one times itself.

218
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,180
So the effect of raising to another power i, it's kind of like we took the dynamics,

219
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,980
we looked at every velocity vector and we said rotate another 90 degrees, so that in this context it would actually be

220
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,600
in the beginning a velocity vector pointing backwards

221
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,960
with one unit. So if you're starting off at the number one, your initial velocity is to walk straight toward zero.

222
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,660
And as you walk even lower, if you were sitting at one half, then you would still be walking towards zero,

223
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,900
but now your velocity vector would be negative one times where you are, which is negative one half.

224
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,860
And what this means for the actual motion that this would imply, you might kind of imagine it,

225
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,540
I haven't animated this nicely yet or anything,

226
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,020
but if you look at this whole vector field and you ask each one of those vectors,

227
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,780
take wherever you are and rotate another 90 degrees,

228
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,120
counterclockwise, they would all be pointed in towards the origin.

229
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,440
So if you were to have a little dot move in such a way that its velocity always matches whatever

230
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,580
vector it's sitting on top of, what you would end up with

231
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,300
is something where with each time step

232
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,360
it kind of takes a step towards zero

233
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,720
and it just with each of your time steps is walking towards zero and each step

234
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,840
has a size that gets smaller and smaller as you actually approach zero.

235
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,700
And of course in practice, this would be

236
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,500
a bunch of infinitesimal steps rather than

237
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,680
very concrete sizing. You might be very exact about it if you wanted and say what we're looking at is

238
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,020
scaling down by some number just less than one

239
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,360
and we're doing this n different times and then we're

240
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,780
gonna multiply that by however much time we're waiting.

241
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,620
And you take this as a limiting expression.

242
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,300
That's just what we talked about in the compound interest lecture

243
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,660
if you're curious and it's kind of the standard way to talk about e to powers as this sort of limit.

244
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,280
You could also have that t living on the inside here instead if you wanted.

245
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,220
But now if we think about

246
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,620
our original point i, our base, what that meant, it was saying look at our dynamics and

247
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,760
it's the point you get to when you wait pi halves units of time.

248
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,500
So the effect of raising to the i changes our dynamics in such a way that instead of walking around a circle

249
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:37,340
we're doing this kind of exponential decay. We're moving towards zero at a slowing and slowing rate and the place that you end up

250
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,160
after pi halves units of time will be e to the negative pi halves

251
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,160
around 0.2079.

252
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,020
So, you know, that's a little bit of intuition for in what sense do two 90 degree rotations combine to get you this very specific value.

253
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,020
One of them changes your dynamics and the original one came from the idea of walking pi halves radians.

254
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,820
So I think that's kind of satisfying in its own way because otherwise when you look at the expression i to the i

255
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,840
equals e to the negative pi halves, it's like what does any of this mean?

256
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,600
This doesn't correspond to any, you know, thing that might see in the real world.

257
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,760
But thinking through the intuitions actually have you thinking through things like what are the dynamics of circular motion?

258
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,540
What are the dynamics for exponential decay? Things that come up in the real world all the time.

259
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,100
But there is a potentially more pressing question

260
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,980
which was raised and let's see if it's still up there.

261
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,440
Well, whoever asked it a little bit earlier, what about other solutions to e to the x equals i?

262
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,960
I think that's that's actually spot on and in fact, let me let me ask other people to contribute some

263
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,380
solutions here. So let's let's go to our quiz. Let me go to question number three,

264
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,700
which is going to be very similar

265
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,300
to a question that was already seen, which is to write a value of x

266
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,580
other than the one we just saw x equals pi halves times i so that e to the x equals i.

267
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,100
And feel free to be as creative as you want to try to get an answer that other people haven't written, right?

268
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,880
Um just to really emphasize that there are actually quite a few different options here and then in a moment

269
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,280
we'll talk about why there are quite a few options if it's not already clear.

270
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,780
But I'll give you a moment to think of which of the many possible values of x you could choose

271
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,060
is the one that you want to put your fingerprint on that you want to be contributing to the live stats page that we're seeing

272
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,700
right now.

273
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,120
I'll give you a little moment.

274
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,420
So,

275
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:49,200
and as you're answering that we've got a question coming in that says wouldn't it be more accurate to say that i to the power i

276
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,820
is i different 90 degree rotations, not two 90 degree rotations. After all it's multiplying by i that's the rotation.

277
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,600
So if we stretch the meaning of words too thin, aren't we multiplying by i i times?

278
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,380
I mean, I think the most honest answer here is just no not at all.

279
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,740
No offense meant but that's just not what exponentiation actually means as soon as we're extending to the idea of complex numbers.

280
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,520
I get the intent you kind of want to stretch the meaning of taking i to the i.

281
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,240
It's as if you're multiplying by itself i different times.

282
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,100
But I cannot think of a way that that actually like satisfactorily makes sense in my mind.

283
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:33,100
What I do think makes some sense is to try to think of the function i to the x.

284
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,420
Say what properties do we want this function to have? And in the context of counting numbers,

285
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,100
you know, if n and k are just things like 3 and 5, we know that it should satisfy

286
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
this idea of

287
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,020
multiplying the outputs correspond to adding the inputs. So we want to say if this is any kind of function,

288
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,460
and I, you know, I've said this in many different forms in many different places,

289
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,920
we want it to satisfy the property that when you add the inputs you multiply the outputs.

290
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,820
That to me is kind of what exponentiation is more so than trying to stretch the idea of repeated multiplication.

291
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,720
So,

292
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,380
it like,

293
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,500
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, if you can definitely, if you can find some way where

294
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:24,060
if you read this off in a stretching language context saying we're taking a 90 degree rotation and applying that i different times,

295
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,480
that's not nonsense and that somehow like intuitively gets you to the answer e to the negative pi halves,

296
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,340
I'm all ears. But I think the healthier relationship to have is to say

297
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,900
we have this central property for exponentiation,

298
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,740
which definitely holds in the context of repeated multiplication.

299
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,340
But to extend beyond the places where repeated multiplication makes any sense, because it just it just doesn't make sense

300
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:53,100
when we're talking about something that's not a counting number like i, or other crazy things that we exponentiate in math like matrices.

301
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:01,540
Focus on the property more so than what some people think of as the origins of that property or the original intuition behind it.

302
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,780
And an interesting question will be, you know, is there just one such function that feels reasonable to write for this?

303
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Because, you know, if we're going to write it as i to the x not only should it satisfy this, it should also satisfy,

304
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,300
you know, when we plug in the number one

305
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,100
we get i,

306
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,640
presumably i to the power one, however we're thinking of this function should be

307
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,740
i.

308
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,880
Is there just one such function or are there multiple such functions?

309
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,220
That's what the quiz question is starting to get at and we've got lots of different answers, which always makes me happy.

310
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,000
So let's see some of the variety that people have thrown in here. So

311
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,720
we've got five pi i halves. Great, that absolutely is another

312
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,880
value that we could plug in for x here. And just to spell out that a little bit more

313
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,020
visually, if we were to look back at our circle here where we've at the moment walked

314
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:58,660
for an amount of time equal to pi halves, which is 1.57, what if instead we took another full turn

315
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,100
and we go another pi halves to get us to pi, which you know, we might kind of record,

316
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,840
that's where the e to the pi i value is.

317
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,160
We walk another pi halves, we walk another pi halves, which at this point

318
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,260
we would have gone a full circle getting us back to one, and then we walk for five pi halves,

319
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,420
which numerically is about 7.85.

320
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:25,380
Yeah, that absolutely is another number that gets us on top of i. And if we were to go through the whole rigmarole of

321
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,860
re-expressing i to the power i

322
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,340
by first writing e to the five

323
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,720
pi halves

324
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,740
i

325
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,400
to the power i,

326
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,320
those i's multiply to become negative and we'd be looking at e to the negative

327
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,240
five pi halves, which is a very different number, right? We can actually calculate this.

328
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm not sure off the top of my head, but let's take a look at Desmos maybe.

329
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,760
Go over here. Let's ask it. What is

330
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,280
e to the

331
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,340
negative five pi halves?

332
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,900
0.000388. Okay, 000388.

333
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,800
Much smaller number.

334
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,820
0.000388.

335
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,100
Which begs the question of okay i to the i, what are you?

336
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,220
Right? Are you about a fifth like we saw before around 0.2?

337
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,200
Or are you this much smaller number?

338
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
And in terms of our intuition, it's basically

339
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,080
a question of how we're interpreting that base i, right?

340
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,520
Are we thinking of it as you wait about 1.57 units of time and then you translate your dynamics into something that looks like decay

341
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,900
rather than spinning and see where you decay to after that amount of time, which is 0.2.

342
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,560
Or do you wait even longer for about 7.85 units of time, which is five pi halves?

343
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,980
And see what happens when you decay for that long, which gets you to a much smaller number.

344
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:54,540
But that's not the only answer that we could enter, right? We have other people coming in here with negative three halves times i pi.

345
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
Which, you know, in terms of a unit circle,

346
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,880
we could think of as saying, hey if I want to get to i, rather than walking

347
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,680
90 degrees, pi halves radians that way, what if I walk

348
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,400
270 degrees the other way?

349
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,420
Three pi halves radians, which maybe I'll think of as negative because the convention is usually that counterclockwise is positive.

350
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,800
That absolutely is another way to express it. And that would get us a different answer. If we had e to the negative

351
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,580
three pi halves i,

352
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:33,460
all to the power i, we go through the same game. Now the i squared cancels with the negative that's already there, and we have a positive

353
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,420
three pi halves.

354
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,480
And numerically this gets us an even different looking answer from what we had before, which if we go over and we say hey,

355
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,560
what is

356
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,180
e to the three pi, not three o, three pi halves

357
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,160
111.31. Very different kind of number than what we saw before.

358
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:03,180
111 point, what was it? 111.31. Great. 111.31 or so.

359
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,700
And again in terms of the intuition, what you might be asking there is, suppose we have this rotating dynamic,

360
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,140
but we move backwards in time.

361
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,020
We see how long ago in time would I have to be, such that if I played things forward from there,

362
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,140
I would land on the number one, my initial condition. And you have to go back in time three pi halves units.

363
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,820
And then if you were to translate to the decay dynamics, which is what raising to the i is doing in this context,

364
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,040
you say if I'm starting at the number one, but I want to move backwards in time and say

365
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,640
where should I have started if I want to decay down such that I end up at the number one after three pi halves units of time?

366
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,400
The answer is evidently starting at around 111 for that kind of exponential decay.

367
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,100
And you can see where this is going, where there's actually infinitely many different values that we could

368
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,400
plug in for x if we're thinking of e to the x as being i.

369
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,340
And people have entered a lot more here.

370
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
Excuse me, throwing my pen onto the ground as one does.

371
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,680
Classic for third place. Nine pi halves, great choice. 1729 pi halves, y'all are my favorite.

372
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,820
Lots and lots of different options, infinitely many different values, which feels a little disconcerting at first, right? Because we look at an expression

373
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,900
that seems like, you know, there's just going to be some computation. I just plug that into my calculator and see what pops out.

374
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,380
And we've got multiple different values for it. So what's going on here, right? What's going on? And I think

375
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,980
this really cuts to the idea of how we think about exponentials in general, right?

376
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,020
But before that I do want to emphasize that this isn't the only time in math where we come across a kind of

377
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:42,280
ambiguity for how to interpret something, right? Because if I say something like, what is the square root of 25?

378
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,760
You know, I think a lot of us say, well,

379
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,500
it's five.

380
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,600
But if we are saying, you know, what should the square root be? It should be some number x such that when you square it

381
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,740
you get 25.

382
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,200
Well, there's two different answers to that. Who's to say that our conventions should be that the square root function

383
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,280
is positive, gives us a positive number rather than

384
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,700
negative five. So we have one expression that seems like it wants to have multiple different values, right?

385
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:17,080
And this could actually happen in another context where instead of square roots, what if I was asking for the fourth root of something like 16?

386
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,920
Usually we would think of this as positive number two, right? Two is a number such that when you multiply by itself four times

387
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,360
you get 16. Seems like a decent answer to a fourth root.

388
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,820
But if we're thinking of this as answering the question, what number to the fourth equals 16?

389
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,220
There is another answer to this. We could also say

390
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,840
negative two. That's a number that when you multiply by itself four times you get 16.

391
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,420
But there's another answer. You could say two times i. That seems valid, but there's another answer.

392
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:54,860
You could think negative two times i. All four of these numbers satisfy that property. So who's to say that

393
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,640
the fourth root of 16 should be two?

394
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,980
And the answer ends up being, well,

395
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,140
we adopt a convention. When there's multiple options like this, when you have a multi-valued function,

396
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,800
we often just choose one of those values to be what we mean when we want to treat it as a function, as something with

397
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,680
a single input and a single output.

398
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,900
In fancier lingo,

399
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,320
this comes up all the time when we're dealing with complex numbers, the idea of something

400
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,700
as an operation kind of wanting to have multiple values. You'll sometimes hear the phrase branch,

401
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,880
where you choose a branch of the square root function,

402
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,720
which is to say you choose a certain convention.

403
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,440
In real numbers, it's nice and easy sometimes because you say just choose the positive one.

404
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,220
But there's no notion of which complex numbers are like the positive complex numbers when we want to take square roots. Just to give one example,

405
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,060
let's say we wanted to take the square root of i.

406
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,740
And we want to know what should that be?

407
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,800
Because there's multiple different answers.

408
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,840
You know, we think of i again as this 90 degree rotation. And if we were thinking of it as a 90 degree rotation,

409
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,560
it feels like the square root should be,

410
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,600
you know, something sitting at a 45 degree angle. Maybe that's the square root of i, which we could write out very explicitly

411
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,560
as root 2 over 2,

412
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
root 2 over 2 i.

413
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
That's just using trigonometry.

414
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,740
But if we were thinking of i instead as being

415
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,360
a negative 270 degree rotation, it feels like half of that, doing half of that operation, should actually get us on the other side.

416
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Maybe the number sitting down here should be the square root of i.

417
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,760
And that's actually just the negative of what we saw before.

418
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,680
Negative root 2 over 2 minus root 2 over 2 times i.

419
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,180
Now in the context of real valued functions, we can say, yeah,

420
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,200
just choose the square root to be whatever the positive answer is. But which of these do you consider the positive answer?

421
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,480
You know, maybe it feels like we should consider this upper one because its coordinates have positive numbers.

422
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,220
But however you try to define positive in a nice way here that's going to be consistent,

423
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,780
you know, for example, two positive numbers should always multiply to make a positive number,

424
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,700
you're not really going to be able to do it the way that you can for real numbers.

425
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,500
And in fact, this phenomenon here where we're taking roots

426
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,960
is actually the same as the phenomenon we were just looking at when we were talking about multiple values for

427
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,500
i raised to the power of i.

428
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,380
Because forget i raised to the power of i, let me ask what might look like a much simpler question

429
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,260
of taking 2 to the power one half.

430
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,380
Okay, what's 2 to the one half?

431
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,100
Yeah, I think you say, well,

432
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,980
we know what this is, we kind of define it to be the square root of 2, all is well and good.

433
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,700
But what if I said let's approach this the same way that we were approaching our i to the i expression?

434
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,460
I want to first express things as e to the something,

435
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,820
right,

436
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,480
and then I'm going to raise that to the one half by multiplying the one half into the exponent.

437
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,880
And I say, well, okay, I can, I guess I can do that.

438
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,780
e to the what is equal to 2? Well, that's the natural log of 2.

439
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,460
It's a constant which is around 0.69

440
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,640
or so.

441
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,040
If we raise e to that power, we'll get 2. So we could be thinking of this as e

442
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,120
to the natural log of 2

443
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,240
times one half.

444
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,600
And if you wanted to, if you

445
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,800
were thinking of e to the x,

446
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,060
you know, this might be kind of overkill in the context of real numbers,

447
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,880
but if you were thinking of e to the x as shorthand for this x function, you could plug in the value

448
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:25,020
0.69 times one half, which I guess would be around 0.345ish, something like that.

449
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:31,220
You plug in that very concrete value into your polynomial, see what it outputs, and it will output around 1.415.

450
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,040
So that's a nice real number. Square root of 2, what you would expect.

451
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,720
But if we do the same thing we were just doing with i and acknowledging that

452
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,180
there's actually multiple different answers when we want to write something as e to a power, we could also write this.

453
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,000
This might seem funny, but we could write it as e to the natural log of 2

454
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,000
plus

455
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,140
2 pi i.

456
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,980
That whole thing

457
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,560
raised to the one half.

458
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,320
Right? After all, this value will come to equal 2.

459
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,460
You could break it down as it's e to the natural log of 2 multiplied by e to the 2 pi i.

460
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,720
This one just has the effect of rotating things 360 degrees. So it's just going to equal 1, so we're looking at 2 times 1.

461
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,880
Great, that feels like a valid substitution.

462
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,280
And yet when we play the same game of taking this and raising it to a power and treating that by

463
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,580
multiplying the power into the exponent, look at what happens. We have e

464
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,780
to the natural log of 2

465
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,400
times one half plus

466
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,240
Well, what's 2 pi i times one half? Well, that will be pi times i.

467
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,860
Now this first part, e to the natural log of 2 times one half,

468
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,200
that will end up being the familiar

469
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,320
square root of 2. That's all well and good.

470
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,140
But we're going to be multiplying that by e to the pi i.

471
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,680
Right? And quite famously e to the pi i

472
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,100
is negative 1.

473
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,640
So in this case, it seems to be suggesting that if we

474
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,420
are solving this expression 2 to the one half by playing around with the different answers

475
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,880
we could plug in for something like e to the

476
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:14,260
x equaling one half, what we end up with is another answer. What we might traditionally write as this negative square root of 2.

477
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,180
And here, I mean it's a little funny for it to have multiple values to look at 2 to the one half

478
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,840
and say that's not equaling one thing, but based on choices we make it could equal

479
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,460
multiple different things. But the two things that it could seem quite reasonable.

480
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,660
If there's going to be anything that 2 to the one half is, it seems like it should either be

481
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,880
the positive square root that we're familiar with or the negative variant of that. That doesn't actually seem like such a problem.

482
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,280
And in fact, we could

483
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,180
we could play this game even further, where let me ask you for even more creative answers to

484
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,260
this expression. Because maybe we can find other funny powers of something like 2 to the power

485
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,240
x as we start plugging in various different values of x based on what substitution we make.

486
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,320
If we're abiding by the same rules that we were using in evaluating i to the power i.

487
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,660
So this time the question asks

488
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,180
or it specifies that one solution of the equation e to the x equals 2 is the real number natural log of 2.

489
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,100
Okay, that one we know it. It's not boring, but it's boring in comparison to what else we could do.

490
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,560
Can you think of another one? Can you write some other

491
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,400
answer to the question e to the x equals 2?

492
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,980
And again, creativity is welcomed. So I will give you another little moment for that.

493
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,740
All right, I will go ahead and lock in some answers here if that's all right with you.

494
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,340
I'm not sure how much time it necessarily takes to do the math entry depending on what device you're looking at.

495
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,160
But

496
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,820
don't be too stressed if it's before you got the chance to

497
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,180
enter the question that you want into the answer that you wanted to answer.

498
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,380
So it looks like 131 of you have entered the variant

499
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,720
where we take ln of 2 and we add 2 pi i. And I guess I in writing this question

500
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,780
mistakenly like marked one of the answers as being correct when in fact there's quite a few different correct ones.

501
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,280
So that's on me for the fact that I don't know if it looks to any of you like,

502
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,020
oh, it's red you got it wrong when you entered ln of 2 plus 42 i pi which is of course a great choice.

503
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,100
But you could also have something like 4 pi i plus the natural log of 2 or 6 pi i.

504
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,060
Or really any integer multiple of 2 pi i if you add that it doesn't affect

505
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,600
e to the x.

506
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,940
Because it just has the effect of multiplying by e to the 2 pi i which is the effect of multiplying by 1.

507
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,800
And again, this has kind of a funny consequence where it seems to output kind of reasonable results when we do it.

508
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,240
As another example, it looks like the second most common entered expression there was that we might replace 2.

509
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,800
So let's think we're thinking of 2 to the power of one fourth. Okay.

510
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,760
There was a suggestion that we replace 2 with e

511
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,280
to the natural log of 2 plus 4 pi i.

512
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:20,720
Okay.

513
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,260
Plus 4 pi i.

514
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,900
And we raise all of that

515
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,020
to the one fourth, right? Well if you were to play the same game you would get

516
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:36,560
e to the natural log of 2 times one fourth and we'd be multiplying by e to the pi i.

517
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,620
Now the first part of that is going to be the usual positive

518
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,240
fourth root of 2. The thing we mean when you plug in an expression like fourth root of 2 into a calculator,

519
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,140
a nice small positive number. But then this second part is negative 1. So it seems to be saying,

520
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,840
you know, if we were to interpret 2 in this different way, raising it to the one fourth,

521
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,560
you know, it's not the usual answer that we get but it's a reasonable answer.

522
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,560
It's another number that when you raise it to the fourth power you get 2.

523
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,720
And if we had done this with even different values, if instead we had been using 2 pi i,

524
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,640
you know, it's kind of fun to think about how that would have changed things. If instead of 4 pi i we had been adding 2 pi i,

525
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,080
well then over here we would have been looking at pi halves times i.

526
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,900
And instead of multiplying by negative 1 we would have instead been multiplying by i.

527
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,540
Which again is a valid answer. It seems like a reasonable output for something like 2 to the one fourth.

528
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,420
So when you're looking at the fact that i to the power i seems to have multiple different values for it,

529
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,200
right, we have this funny phenomenon where we can plug in e to the 5 pi halves i, negative 3 pi halves i,

530
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,000
and we get what seem like wildly different answers. Something super small, something super big, all very different from the

531
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,840
one fifth, approximately one fifth answer that we found before up here.

532
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,580
It's exactly the same phenomenon as when you're asking something like what's 2 to the one fourth

533
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:06,900
and acknowledging that there's actually multiple different solutions to the expression x to the fourth equals 2. Four different solutions in fact.

534
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,220
And what you're looking at is the fact that there's multiple different solutions

535
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:17,560
to the expression e to the x equals some kind of base, whether that base is i, whether that base is 2, whatever it might be.

536
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,320
And one way that we might

537
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,400
think about this is that when you're dealing with real numbers things are just lovely.

538
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,500
Things are nice. There's one-to-one relationships. You've got positives.

539
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,580
It's great.

540
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,540
Where if we want to think about exponential functions,

541
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,180
let me just cover some of this stuff up.

542
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:45,060
We have this nice back and forth where you can choose to express any exponential as a base to x like 2 to the x

543
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:52,740
or you could express that same exponential as x of r times x which you know, that is the polynomial that we refer to

544
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,820
whenever implicitly refer to whenever we write something like e to the x.

545
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,880
And there's a lovely back and forth because you can just take a natural logarithm of b

546
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,280
and it gives you one answer assuming that b is a positive number.

547
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,080
And that's the same thing as saying that x of r is equal to b.

548
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:14,860
So one way that I've talked about this earlier in the series is that if you were looking at the family of all possible exponentials,

549
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,760
right, we could write them as x of r times x and change what r is.

550
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,800
And this is exactly the same thing as writing e to the r times x if that's something you're more comfortable with.

551
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,440
So e to the r times x x of r times x those are the same thing. We could think about changing what that is.

552
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,060
But on the other hand if you were to think about all possible exponentials as some base,

553
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,500
let me do base to the power of x and we're going to change what that base is.

554
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,780
At first it feels like that's a different kind of expression to manipulate but it's just another way of expressing the same family.

555
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,980
Right, and a way that you might think about this

556
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,680
for how do we think about what base does it correspond to if we're thinking a little bit more abstractly

557
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,180
as exp of r times x. And there's a reason I'm doing this because we're about to apply this to complex numbers where it's going to look weirder.

558
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,320
So follow through with me here. If instead of looking at that base,

559
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,240
one thing I could do is say what is the value

560
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,000
of exp of r, right, which is basically this function of when we plug in one. So exp of r times one

561
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
if you prefer to think of it that way.

562
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,480
And that is being represented by our green line. And what you can see is okay if I get r that

563
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:31,220
a factor in front of x in my exponential function exp of r x to be 0.69,

564
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,580
which I know is around the natural log of two. What this means is that

565
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,860
exp of one is about two.

566
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,620
And so this corresponds with the function that we would usually write as two to the power x.

567
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:43,620
Right.

568
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,460
Okay, and basically as I change around my r, you know, I could try to change it to something so that

569
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,040
it looks like three. So around 1.1 that exponential looks like three, which we would usually write as three to the power x.

570
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,600
I would like to argue that it's a little bit healthier to think about varying this value r rather than varying the base.

571
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,500
And the main reason is that as soon as we get to complex contexts and we're thinking of

572
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,640
exponentiation,

573
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,740
you have this overloading that goes on where if we change around what sits in front of the x, that's all well and good.

574
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,100
I could have exp of r times x where maybe r is something like 0.69.

575
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,120
But I could shift that down by 2 pi i.

576
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,820
And that doesn't change the base that it would correspond to. That would still correspond to two.

577
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,840
Or it could shift it up by 2 pi i. That doesn't change the base that it corresponds to.

578
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,020
Because in all of those cases when we plug in x equals one, we get the same thing.

579
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,620
However, all of these for different values of x are distinct functions.

580
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,580
This is why we saw multiple different values for i to the power i.

581
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:53,900
Because i to the x is an ambiguous function in that context. It would be unambiguous if we decided which value of r

582
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,260
such that

583
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,640
what we're representing is exp of r times x, which value of r do we choose? As soon as we choose one,

584
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,160
it's an unambiguous function.

585
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,240
But at that point it just feels like maybe what we want is to stop thinking about things in terms of some base raised to the power x.

586
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,880
Maybe as soon as we're in the context of complex numbers,

587
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,040
we should just write them all as exp of some constant times x. If for no other reason,

588
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,180
it makes crystal clear how we actually plug in numbers if we want to do a computation,

589
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,040
or just to do math on top of it. We've got this nice infinite polynomial that we plug them into.

590
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,020
And I'll make another case for you that this is maybe the

591
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,920
the correct way to think about exponentials, as soon as we're extending into other domains, things like complex numbers.

592
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,780
And for that, let's just let's just back up.

593
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,420
Go back. Oh doorbell, something's arrived. Go back to the original

594
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,980
way that we extend the idea of exponentiation and just think of like what is two to the x?

595
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,000
Right. We know how to think about this for natural numbers, you know something like two to the three,

596
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:05,140
repeated multiplication. How is it that you're first taught to think about something like two to the x for fractional amounts or

597
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,700
for negative amounts and things like that?

598
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,560
Well, you're usually taught that

599
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,880
two to the one half

600
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,800
should be something where

601
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,900
you know if I multiply it by itself

602
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,400
and this follows the usual rules that exponentials do with counting numbers where we're able to add things in that exponent,

603
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,140
I should get two to the one.

604
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,100
So it should be some number that when I multiply it by itself,

605
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,380
I get two.

606
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,460
And you know at that point you have a choice. Maybe it's positive. Maybe it's negative.

607
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,200
But if you always decide to make the positive choice, you're going to be able to get a nice continuous function out of this.

608
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,840
Same deal if we ask about negative numbers, what should two to the negative one be?

609
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,960
Well, that should be something where when I multiply it by two to the one, it gets me two to the zero.

610
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,500
And that's kind of the justification for our convention that negative exponents look like one half.

611
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,780
But what's really going on here is we're saying whatever this is, it should be some kind of function

612
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,480
that satisfies this property f of a plus b

613
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,240
equals f of a times f of b.

614
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:12,080
And moreover the fact that the base is two is basically telling us that it's not just any such function.

615
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,440
It's a function where when we plug in one we get two.

616
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:22,480
And just as a little, you know, sanity check style question to see if you're following along with some of the implications here.

617
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,380
I want to ask you what is,

618
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,700
I won't call it like a softball, but this is, this isn't meant to be like

619
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,720
an incredibly deep question necessarily. It's just more of a check if you're following along with

620
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:42,180
the idea of abstractly starting with properties of a function and then kind of deducing ways that we might want to write it down

621
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,420
based on those properties.

622
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,860
If f of x satisfies this exponential property f of a plus b equals f of a times f of b for all inputs,

623
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:57,740
and it also satisfies f of one equals two, which of the following is true? Which is to say which of the following is necessarily true

624
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,080
no matter

625
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,380
which such function you're starting with.

626
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,580
And those of you who remember which lecture was it?

627
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:10,440
It's whichever one we were talking about how to interpret what Euler's formula is really saying. I asked a question of this style where

628
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,680
I neglected a single condition, you know, I didn't write down the fact that

629
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,700
we want to make sure f of x is non-zero everywhere and then that caused some amount of confutlement.

630
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,160
Which is cool, get confutlement on screen that happens to all of us.

631
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,960
But the the intent of it was to basically show that this abstract property of something that turns addition into multiplication

632
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,720
is uh

633
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,700
is enough to basically make you want to write the function as whatever it equals as one raised to some kind of power.

634
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,980
This is the the spirit of the question.

635
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:42,800
Um

636
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,180
Now we've got a couple questions actually about power towers that seem to have popped up here, which is great connected to last time.

637
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:59,960
Um, let's let's hold off on the power tower question for just a moment, so that we first get like a deeper feel of like

638
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,260
what exponentiation should mean here.

639
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,260
Um, because because we can be what I want to claim is we can answer it in like multiple different ways.

640
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,880
So if you give me just a moment, we'll talk about power towers.

641
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,560
Uh, and then just as a number line can be represented in a logarithmic scale, can the same be done for a complex plane?

642
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,800
Maybe mapping the complex plane onto an infinite cylinder in the logarithmic sense. Yeah. Yeah, uh,

643
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:29,020
in fact, there's a visualization that I'm going to get to in just a moment here where we do something quite similar to that.

644
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:36,720
Because what we'll do is play around with different exponential functions x of r times x, but we're going to change that value of r

645
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,600
which is going to be represented by a little yellow dot. So we'll kind of talk through this.

646
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,540
It's not going to map the whole plane, but just a couple sample points from the real axis and the imaginary axis.

647
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,740
But the idea is that as we move around what that constant is, we're going to be able to kind of visualize

648
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,800
the different things that um, it does to the plane. And effectively,

649
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,460
it's like it's turning the x-axis into a logarithmic scale and then wrapping the imaginary axis along a circle.

650
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,700
And then as soon as that value of r becomes imaginary, it swaps the role of those.

651
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:12,140
Real numbers get put on the circle and imaginary numbers get put on a logarithmic scaled positive axis. So great question.

652
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:17,460
All three of which I guess are sort of jumping the gun ahead for where I want to go, but nice to see that's where people are thinking.

653
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,000
So on this one, let's go ahead and just grade it.

654
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,260
The idea

655
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,180
is that

656
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,720
this property of f of a plus b ends up letting you express a lot of different things purely in terms of

657
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,060
what f of one is. And just to spell that out very

658
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,420
explicitly,

659
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,960
something like f of five

660
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,880
is the same thing

661
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,140
as f of one plus one plus one plus one plus one,

662
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,540
which is the same thing as f of one multiplied by itself five times because of this property.

663
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:57,000
Which if f of one is two is the same as two to the power five. And then something like f of negative five,

664
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,260
it should be the case that when we multiply it by f of five,

665
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:10,060
we get whatever f of zero is. And it's not immediately clear what f of zero is, but we could say that f of one plus zero

666
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:17,700
is equal to whatever f of one is times what f of zero is. But f of one is equal to two,

667
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,740
and so this is also equal to two. So we're saying two is equal to two times something. Well that something has to be a one.

668
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,020
So in this context this guarantees that f of negative five is

669
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:34,440
two to the negative five. It's one over two to the fifth. So we could explicitly write this as two to the negative five.

670
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,800
Which is all to say,

671
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,500
these two properties together make us really want to write the function as

672
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,840
two to the x,

673
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,600
because any counting number that we put in,

674
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,500
it's going to satisfy,

675
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,660
it's going to look like two multiplied by itself that number of times. Any fractional number we put in,

676
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,820
it's going to satisfy these properties that we wanted.

677
00:50:54,820 --> 00:51:01,020
And you might wonder, is that unique? And in the context of real valued functions, it actually would be.

678
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,860
But in the context of complex valued functions, there would be multiple such functions f that we could write for this.

679
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,100
One of which is what we were looking at before, where we could have a function defined to be

680
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,340
exp of

681
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,780
the natural log of two

682
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,860
plus two pi i

683
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,040
all of that times x.

684
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,200
Okay, forgive the sloppiness here. I just get excited writing about this.

685
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,720
And this is actually a different function, as evidenced by what happens if you plug in x equals one half.

686
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,380
Right, we saw a little bit earlier how when you plug in one half, what you get is the negative square root of two.

687
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,140
And then if you plug in one fourth, you get

688
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,780
not the fourth root of two, but i times the fourth root of two. So it is a different function,

689
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,680
but it still satisfies these properties, and it kind of makes us want to write it as two to the x.

690
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,080
And it makes it suggest that maybe two to the x

691
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,660
is an ambiguous bit of notation, and we should just write everything in terms of exp of r times something.

692
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,020
But you might wonder,

693
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:00,920
well,

694
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,060
you know, maybe we're just not being creative enough with all of the functions that satisfy this property.

695
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,160
Maybe there's an ambiguity when we write exp of r times something, and there's different values of r that could come into play.

696
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:10,880
Um,

697
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:16,260
but I'm just going to put down a little claim, and then maybe give like a sketch of what the proof would look like if

698
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,640
you want, which is that let's say you have some complex function f, and it satisfies the following properties.

699
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,140
First, you're able to take a derivative of it. It's differentiable, which just keeps it from being some, uh,

700
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,200
you know, totally messy discontinuous thing that's like taking on some random values depending on, you know, the

701
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,480
span of whatever vector space over,

702
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,700
I don't know, fractional amounts you might want to think of in crazy ways. It's a nice function that's differentiable.

703
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,900
It's not equal to zero everywhere.

704
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,560
So the condition that sort of slipped my mind and

705
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,320
I forget which lecture, lecture four or something like that.

706
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,140
And then it has this central property that it turns addition into multiplication. If you have such a function,

707
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,400
I claim that there's a unique, maybe I should really specify, there exists a unique

708
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:13,080
complex number r so that you could write f of x as basically being this exponential function of r times that value x.

709
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,660
Which is, you know, basically saying that if you have

710
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:23,640
exp as a function, this infinite polynomial with nice derivative properties and all of that, if you have this you have

711
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:30,000
every exponential that you want in a very like abstract generic sense of the word exponential just based on a property that we could want

712
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,640
from it.

713
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,520
And the sketch of the proof would look something like this.

714
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,580
If you want to first look at what is the derivative of this value, which we're assuming exists everywhere, right?

715
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,540
And you explicitly write out what the limit of that is.

716
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,100
I'll just talk through it very quickly here for those who want to like pause and think through the details, feel free to.

717
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,760
The central property that we have lets us

718
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,560
expand out the f of x plus h term.

719
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:59,060
So we're thinking, you know, a change, slight change to the output over the change to the input that caused it. That's what df dx

720
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,720
unwraps to.

721
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:07,520
And because we can factor that out, we can factor f of x out of the expression entirely and the whole limit

722
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,320
is expressed only in terms of h.

723
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:16,280
Which if you think about what it means in the context of derivatives and the fact that f of zero necessarily equals one,

724
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,360
this whole limiting expression

725
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,840
is just some constant, but more specifically it's whatever the derivative of our function at zero is.

726
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,860
So you have this funny thing where if you know its derivative at zero that determines what its derivative is everywhere.

727
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,040
And in the context of exponential functions

728
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:39,260
this is hopefully quite familiar because all that we're really saying is the derivative of an exponential function is proportional to itself

729
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:44,200
and that proportionality constant is equal to whatever the derivative at zero is.

730
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,480
This is all very abstractly phrased and such, but the purpose of it is to emphasize that it's not

731
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:56,320
necessarily just functions that we already think of as a to the power x, but it is a potentially much more broad class of functions

732
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,360
that just satisfy this abstract property of turning addition into multiplication.

733
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,380
But if you have that, it actually guarantees that you also have a second derivative.

734
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:11,060
And for that matter a third derivative and such because the derivative function is just proportional to itself.

735
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,050
So in order to take the nth derivative you just look at

736
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,700
that proportionality constant and raise it to the power n.

737
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,560
And then from here

738
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,900
you could do a Taylor series expansion and I might leave that as sort of the advanced homework for those of you who are comfortable with

739
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,320
Taylor series and that idea

740
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,500
especially if you want to intermix the idea of

741
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:32,600
any

742
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:39,040
differentiable function that's differentiable in a sense of complex numbers, which is sort of a definitely college topic.

743
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,660
You know, you could intermix the reasoning there as you want, but

744
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:48,520
fuzzy reasoning is allowed in the context of someone who only knows about Taylor series and nothing else

745
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,980
to take this idea and look at the Taylor expansion for f and kind of justify the idea that

746
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,360
there's a unique complex number such that our function f can necessarily be written like this.

747
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:06,840
And then the connection to normal exponentials is whenever you have such a value r

748
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:15,220
we do essentially what we do in the complex context of real numbers is if you look at x of that function of that value r

749
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:21,100
and write that as a base it feels like you should be able to write that as b to the x.

750
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,780
But the whole the whole point here of course is that when we play this game

751
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,420
and you're trying to interpret something like i to the x that's an ambiguous function

752
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,460
because there's lots of different values of r we could interpret that to mean not just

753
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,560
exp of pi halves i times x

754
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,760
but we could also interpret it to mean

755
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,540
exp of five pi halves

756
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,520
i times x

757
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:51,320
and these are separate functions and there's an infinite family of separate functions that feel like we should write them as i to the x.

758
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,960
So the expression i to the i unless you've adopted a standard for what that's necessarily going to mean

759
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,280
when you say it has infinitely many outputs another way to think of that is that

760
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,060
the function i to the x with the notation we have is a little bit ambiguous.

761
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,720
Now with all of that, let's let's just start visualizing some of this because I think that's fun.

762
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,160
And you know, you you tell me if this is if this is a helpful visual or a more confusing visual

763
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:21,320
but what we're going to do is look at this function exp of r times x which is

764
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,200
basically this is another way to write e to the power of x. In fact, I think I

765
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,800
I think I rendered a different animation at some point that specified that because I was planning on

766
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:37,460
planning on doing that. So let me oh, yeah, there you are get back in my file system get back to where you're supposed to be.

767
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,360
Get on in there is it complaining because there's multiple different?

768
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,200
It's going to be like there's a oh replace it shows up on the other screen.

769
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,920
Wait, why is it? Yeah, okay replace place whatever you see there.

770
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,920
And now we go back to oh there we go all of that all of that just so that I could have nicely written out

771
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,600
uh, if you're uncomfortable with thinking of it as exp of r times x this infinite polynomial

772
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,720
Just in the back of your head e to the r times x and we're going to vary around r

773
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:16,660
So i'm going to follow the points of the imaginary axis and i'm going to follow the points of the real axis

774
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,820
And uh, let's see what this does

775
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,120
Well, that's all kind of fast so let me think through it a little bit more slowly all of the negative numbers

776
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:31,780
Anything that's a negative real number is going to get squished into the range between zero and one which should make sense e to the negative

777
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,840
e to a negative real number is something between zero and one and we're

778
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,720
Specifically tracking f of negative one which is going to show up around whatever one over e is around

779
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,660
zero point three seven

780
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,260
f of one lands on e

781
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,180
As expected that's what x of one is

782
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,600
f of i

783
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:56,120
Is going to land one radian around the unit circle and it's kind of fun to follow along the whole imaginary axis here

784
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,660
How the imaginary axis gets uh wrapped around a circle?

785
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:06,640
And what happens as we tweak this value of r that's determining not just that we're talking about an exponential function

786
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:14,300
But which exponential function there's a nice one-to-one correspondence between all the exponential functions we might want and values of r here

787
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,040
It stretches things differently

788
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,340
So when we put it up to two

789
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:23,060
You know it stretches out the real axis a lot more so that f of one ends up around where e squared is a little

790
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,920
Above seven f of negative one is much closer to zero f of i

791
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,780
Is a two radian rotation around the circle f of negative i is a negative two radian rotation

792
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,600
And of course we can get to our favorite formula that

793
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:41,820
If that were pi that we had as our scaling constant then the real axis gets stretched out quite a lot

794
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,960
you know f of one is sitting off at

795
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:50,760
e to the pi which is very close to 20 plus pi which is always fun and f of negative one extremely close to zero so

796
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,180
It's really stretched out that real axis and it's also stretched out things in the

797
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,700
Unit circle direction so that getting to f of i or f of negative i walks halfway around the circle

798
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,200
So that's all well and good now. How would we think about a function like?

799
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,520
two to the x

800
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,820
Which is what?

801
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,640
We would also write as exp of

802
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,520
Exp of the natural log of two times x

803
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,840
So we kind of move our yellow dot representing the value of r to around zero point six nine still no imaginary part

804
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,020
Just a real number zero point six nine or so. That's the natural log of two

805
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:32,240
Well, you can see that f of one lands on two, which is why we want to call this function two to the x

806
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:37,640
f of one half actually, sorry f of negative one lands right on one half f of i

807
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,840
It's some walk around the unit circle very specifically it's going to be 0.69 radians around the unit circle

808
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,240
And now we could have a little bit more fun and say what would happen if we were to

809
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:56,280
Change this to instead of being 0.69 instead of being the natural log of two make it i times the natural log of two

810
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,380
So that we're really thinking of something that might have an exponential base to it

811
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,100
This would be what we might think of as two times i

812
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,140
Raised to a power

813
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:13,060
Well, if we move that yellow dot which is representing r off of the real axis and onto the imaginary axis

814
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,900
it swaps the roles of

815
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,580
the

816
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:22,640
Teal dots and all of the maroon dots in this context which remember came from being the positive and imaginary axes

817
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,260
And it should make sense that it swaps their roles because what does it mean if we take the input space and we multiply it?

818
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,900
By i it means we're rotating that input space

819
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:35,840
So everything that was the real number axis turns into the imaginary axis and everything that was the imaginary axis

820
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,700
Is getting turned into the real axis

821
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,860
So for us what that means is our new exponential function where our value of r is now purely imaginary

822
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,720
Takes all of the real numbers and it just wraps them around a circle and it takes all the imaginary numbers

823
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,120
And it's putting them onto the real number line

824
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,580
So in particular, let's say we scale this thing up so that we're sitting at around pi halves times i

825
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,240
Well, what does that actually mean?

826
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,820
That means it takes the real number one to the value i

827
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,740
Which is the sense in which we want to write this function as i to the power x

828
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:10,360
Right. It just tempts us to write it not as this abstract looking thing

829
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,220
X of r times x where r is equal to pi halves i no

830
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,760
No, we just want to write it as i to the x even if that's a little ambiguous

831
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,360
What that really means is just that the function we're dealing with outputs i at one

832
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,020
and if it's an exponential function that

833
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,960
Uh, and we're asking what does it do to the value i?

834
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,800
What is i to the power i?

835
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,420
In this case, it shoves it to around uh, 0.2 around a fifth

836
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,960
But there's many different exponential functions that would have this property of putting f of one onto the number i

837
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,920
So if we were to scale it up even further, I don't think I have it animated here

838
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,760
But if we were to take that yellow dot and raise it up until it got to five halves times pi i

839
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,460
What you would see is that the unit circle?

840
01:02:53,060 --> 01:03:00,540
Uh is rotated around on itself so that f of negative f of one would rotate around another two pi radians and land where it is

841
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,940
But it would stretch out the real axis a lot more

842
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:09,340
Which was the sense in which another output of i to the i is a much much smaller number. It was around. What was it?

843
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,880
0.0003 or so

844
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,820
But we can also see what I think is quite fun. What happens if we consider

845
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:21,000
Alternate expressions that we want to interpret as two to the power x right?

846
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,060
So when r is a purely real number the natural log of two kind of makes sense that when you plug it in here

847
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,340
The expression we get is what we want to write as two to the power x

848
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,580
But what if we start moving it in the imaginary direction? Okay

849
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,620
And what i'll first do is i'll move it up by pi i units

850
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,420
Now what's going on here?

851
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:46,800
We have x of r times x and r is equal to this value, which is the natural log of two plus pi times i

852
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,600
What that means is that when we plug in one?

853
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,140
f of one is at negative two, so we want to write this function as negative two to the power x

854
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,500
right, and that's actually something that

855
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,500
You know, it's it's a little deceptively simple when we write

856
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,220
a negative number to a power

857
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,520
Negative two

858
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:12,600
To the power x it doesn't at first look like this necessarily it brings us into the complex numbers in any way

859
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,780
but of course when we plug in even a value like

860
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,960
One half

861
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,000
Where we're kind of asking for a square root of negative two

862
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,380
We we realize that we want to write this as something like i times the square root of two

863
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,960
But if you were to look at this function negative two to the power x in the full complex domain that it's dealing with

864
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,640
What you're looking at is a function that takes the value of one to negative two

865
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,660
And if it does that what it does to the rest of the real number line is it kind of spirals it outward?

866
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,200
So we see that f of negative one sits at negative one half

867
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,800
About where you would expect if you were to follow to f of one half

868
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,980
It would sit exactly on the imaginary line and f of one half would be square root of two

869
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,200
Well, my mouse is not where I want it to be. It would be around a square root of two

870
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,280
times i

871
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,520
and

872
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:08,120
As you continue further on this is showing you all of the real value powers of negative two to the x it necessarily spirals around

873
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:16,660
Um, but we could also move our value of r even higher and get it up to around tau times i around 6.28 times i

874
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,960
And in that context, this is another function that we would want to write as something like two to the x

875
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,840
because

876
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:29,120
For any whole number to whole number that you plug in for x it will look like repeated multiplication

877
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:35,860
And it even has kind of reasonable values for things like one half where it spits out the negative square root instead of the positive square

878
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,960
But what it's actually doing is a transformation to the plane where it puts everything

879
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,740
Uh is the real number line ends up being a very tightly wound spiral

880
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,580
That goes around and it just spirals in such a way that f of one lands right on the number two

881
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,340
so it is in that sense that we could say, um two to the x is

882
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:00,640
Is plausibly interpreted as a separate exponential function from the one that we are traditionally used to

883
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,380
so I think with all of that I will um

884
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:10,240
I will leave things for today and i'll just leave you with a couple lingering questions to think about. Okay, so

885
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:15,440
If you want to think of i to the i as being a multi-valued expression, right?

886
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,640
You could you could say we adopt a convention

887
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:24,640
Fancifully you'd say you choose a branch of the natural logarithm function and maybe that locks you into this being e to the negative pi halves

888
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:30,300
But if you say this kind of wants to be infinitely many different values like the various ones that we saw

889
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:38,260
How many values does two to the one-third want to be in the same sense where we are replacing two with various different

890
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:38,640
uh

891
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,720
various different options for e to the x

892
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,560
Such that e to the x equals two

893
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,670
How many different values does that want to be or how many values does two to the three-tenths want to be?

894
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,340
Phrased differently of all of the uh, let me say of all of the exponential functions

895
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:04,020
So f of x which satisfy oh have I written it down somewhere f of x that satisfies

896
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:08,720
All of these properties that i've written so if it satisfies all of these

897
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:09,920
um

898
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,720
and if f of

899
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,700
one is equal to two

900
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:20,300
Right, how many different outputs are we going to get when we plug in x equals three-tenths for the various options for what function?

901
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,580
That is and how many outputs are we going to get?

902
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,660
For two to the pi for the various functions that two to the x could represent

903
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:34,820
If we're thinking of two to the x as some kind of exponential function exponential in the sense of these sort of abstract properties

904
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,080
and if we uh

905
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,040
yeah, if we if we have a

906
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,080
Class of different such functions and we want to plug in pi it makes me laugh just because it's such a I don't know

907
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,760
Kind of a funny answer that pops out

908
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,160
As you're trying to think about it. So those are the questions that i'll leave you with and

909
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,260
I think this is you know, my my

910
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,960
My central question in approaching today's lecture was whether I wanted to be

911
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:05,340
um kind of describing like these abstract properties of exponential functions and it's just cool to me that

912
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:10,340
Starting from those abstract properties you get locked into the idea of e to the rx or more

913
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:15,340
You know, I think more honestly written exp of r times x for different values of r

914
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:19,780
That it locks you in that far but it doesn't lock you in as far as having an unambiguous

915
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,520
Notion of what two to the power x should be much less something like i to the power x

916
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:31,220
The risk in that of course is that sometimes people don't love abstraction and sometimes it doesn't come off as approachable

917
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,040
But if that's the case, you know, you just let me know I think

918
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:41,820
I think there's a whole interesting circle of thoughts that surrounds all of this stuff to include power towers because if you want to

919
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:47,500
Actually talk about power towers like we were last time in the context of complex numbers or even with negative bases

920
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,440
You have to be thinking through things like this so, um, it was a question that we had up on screen

921
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,940
Uh, yeah, what happens if we do this for i to the power i titration, you know, let's just try this

922
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:04,600
Let's just go ahead and try a power tower where we're raising i to a given power and see what uh, what pops out of it

923
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,940
so I wasn't planning on doing this but we can

924
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,800
We can always pull up python and essentially do what we were doing last time

925
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,040
so the way that this would work

926
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:18,140
Is we were starting off with some base value and then for some kind of range

927
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,700
What were we doing?

928
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,160
We were taking a and we're going to reassign it

929
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,280
to be

930
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:24,980
whatever

931
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:30,020
The base which in this case is i raised to the power of a should be

932
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:35,240
Okay, cool. So we're going to do that and then we're going to print off the value of a and let's just do this for

933
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,760
Uh, yeah, it's a much bigger number like 200

934
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:40,420
uh

935
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,720
So it seems like what happens is

936
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:51,860
There's there's potential for chaos with these things like sometimes it's not that you've landed on a stable

937
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:58,840
A stable value or it's not even that you've diverged it could be that you're bouncing between a cycle of values or

938
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:04,800
That you're like literally bouncing in a way that's um, it's not periodic or anything and it's actually chaotic

939
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,280
I I suspect that doesn't happen for i but it's a thing to potentially look out for

940
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,700
It looks like it does kind of stabilize

941
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,360
um, maybe there's

942
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:20,840
Some little subjection to numerical error, but we stay pretty consistently around something with a real part of 0.43

943
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,500
and 0.36

944
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,720
Now what I would want to emphasize though is this expression

945
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,340
So let's set a back to b equal to 1 this expression of taking i to the power of a remember

946
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:36,600
That's a little bit ambiguous. It depends on what choice of the function I we actually have so let me

947
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,720
Let me import

948
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,600
NumPy so I have the exponential function

949
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,860
Let me go

950
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,580
For our big range like we had before

951
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,440
Rather than writing it as you know, something that's like i to the power of x

952
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,560
I'm going to write it as the exponential function of a different constant

953
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:54,540
right

954
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,240
a different constant

955
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,800
That i'm going to make

956
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,960
I want it to be five pi halves. So i'll do five

957
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:02,680
pi

958
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,240
halves times i so it's a complex number

959
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,380
And it's got five pi halves as the imaginary part

960
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:14,560
So this is five pi halves times i and what am I doing? I'm exponentiating that

961
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:22,350
So I want to multiply a onto the inside there. Okay, this is basically another way that you could interpret the expression i to the x

962
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,720
Thankfully you would say you've chosen a different branch of the natural log function

963
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,220
But it is another

964
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:32,640
Function which we could iterate on itself and see what happens and we might get a different result

965
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,800
Ah very interesting, okay, so we actually have a different result

966
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,060
It looks like what ends up happening is it bounces between two values?

967
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:47,980
Oh, wow, is it period three? That's interesting period three implies chaos. So we've got seven point three five then zero then point nine nine

968
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:53,620
So it looks like it gets into the cycle of bouncing between three separate values even though

969
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:54,900
um

970
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,080
In theory in both of those cases we were doing something that was i to the x iterated on itself

971
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,640
It has everything to do with what actual function you think i to the x is referring to so in that sense

972
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,240
The power tower question is ambiguous

973
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,720
Usually you just choose it to be the pi halves i variant but it's more fun to see that it can be multiple things

974
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:21,620
All right. We have addition multiplication exponentiation titration. Can we think of something in between halfway between multiplication and exponentiation?

975
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,860
oh, that's an

976
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,240
uh, I mean

977
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:31,320
Spirit of it because each one of them it comes down to like a discrete step of you're repeating the previous operation

978
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,000
But oftentimes in math when you have something initially defined in terms of repetition

979
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,120
Like exponentiation you can extend it beyond that. I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but that's an interesting question

980
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,820
I don't know if that's been

981
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:49,100
That's an extended notion. I mean you have things like fractional derivatives you have things like fractional and complex exponents

982
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,780
So it doesn't seem outlandish, but i'm not familiar with one myself

983
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:58,900
And then lastly do complex numbers to the power of complex number values arise in physics and if yes

984
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,420
How does one decide which values are valid?

985
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:02,260
so

986
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,720
I can't think of if they necessary. Oh, sorry scene switching. I can't think of if they

987
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,680
Come up in physics in like a direct sense and this is probably just because i'm not a physicist. So I uh,

988
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,880
I would say like ask ask your neighborhood physicist and see see what they have to say

989
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,900
I mean clearly the point of teaching the lesson here is that the thoughts that you have to go through to make sense out of

990
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:29,280
It do build a stronger relationship with exponentials things like it's not just more natural to represent them as e to the rx

991
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,560
Once you get to complex numbers, you kind of have to represent them that way

992
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,760
Whereas previously in like physics or other real world contexts. It's something that's just nice
