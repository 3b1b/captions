  874.42
 ],
 [
  "Once we're thinking of our dynamics here as each one of your velocity vectors as a 90 degree rotation of your position, this base i, the way that we're kind of thinking about it reading it off as something with meaning rather than just a number, is that as a point on the plane, it's where you get after traveling for pi halves units of time according to the dynamics of this expression, according to the idea that your velocity is always a 90 degree rotation of your position.",

  904.44,

  922.44,
  928.98
 ],
 [
  "Because as we go from e to the i times t, and instead we, you know, raise things to another power of i, which I'll just write with a little caret i, if we take e to the i t and we alter what that expression is by raising it to the i, what we get is e to the negative t.",
  929.44,
  946.08

  "Okay, so we have e to the negative t.",
  948.04,
  950.02
 ],
 [
  "And if we try to interpret that with the same sort of dynamics that we had above in terms of a velocity and a position, what that's telling us is that the derivative of our new dynamic e to the negative t is equal to, well now the constant sitting in front of t is negative one, so our chain rule will have it be negative one times itself, times e to the negative t.",
  951.0,
  977.84

  978.0,
  981.68

  "So the effect of raising to another power i, it's kind of like we took the dynamics, we looked at every velocity vector and we said rotate another 90 degrees, so that in this context it would actually be in the beginning a velocity vector pointing backwards with one unit.",
  982.1,
  998.2
 ],
 [
  "So if you're starting off at the number one, your initial velocity is to walk straight toward zero.",
  998.68,
  1002.96
 ],
 [
  "And as you walk even lower, if you were sitting at one half, then you would still be walking towards zero, but now your velocity vector would be negative one times where you are, which is negative one half.",
  1003.28,
  1013.9
 ],
 [
  "And what this means for the actual motion that this would imply, you might kind of imagine it, I haven't animated this nicely yet or anything, but if you look at this whole vector field and you ask each one of those vectors, take wherever you are and rotate another 90 degrees, counterclockwise, they would all be pointed in towards the origin.",
  1014.64,
  1031.12
 ],
 [
  "So if you were to have a little dot move in such a way that its velocity always matches whatever vector it's sitting on top of, what you would end up with is something where with each time step it kind of takes a step towards zero and it just with each of your time steps is walking towards zero and each step has a size that gets smaller and smaller as you actually approach zero.",
  1031.84,
  1053.84

  "So those are the questions that i'll leave you with and I think this is you know, my my My central question in approaching today's lecture was whether I wanted to be um kind of describing like these abstract properties of exponential functions and it's just cool to me that Starting from those abstract properties you get locked into the idea of e to the rx or more You know, I think more honestly written exp of r times x for different values of r That it locks you in that far but it doesn't lock you in as far as having an unambiguous Notion of what two to the power x should be much less something like i to the power x The risk in that of course is that sometimes people don't love abstraction and sometimes it doesn't come off as approachable But if that's the case, you know, you just let me know I think I think there's a whole interesting circle of thoughts that surrounds all of this stuff to include power towers because if you want to Actually talk about power towers like we were last time in the context of complex numbers or even with negative bases You have to be thinking through things like this so, um, it was a question that we had up on screen Uh, yeah, what happens if we do this for i to the power i titration, you know, let's just try this Let's just go ahead and try a power tower where we're raising i to a given power and see what uh, what pops out of it so I wasn't planning on doing this but we can We can always pull up python and essentially do what we were doing last time so the way that this would work Is we were starting off with some base value and then for some kind of range What were we doing?",
