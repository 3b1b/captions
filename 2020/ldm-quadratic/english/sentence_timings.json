 [
  "So in this first lecture, what I'm going to talk with you guys about is the quadratic formula.",
  3.98,
  7.76
 ],
 [
  "And traditionally, I think the quadratic formula is one of the most famously memorized things in high school.",
  8.36,
  13.32
 ],
 [
  "We almost all kind of have this song that sings in our head related to it.",
  13.48,
  17.1
 ],
 [
  "And yet, if you actually ask someone, how often do you expect you're going to be using this in the real world?",
  17.42,
  22.78
 ],
 [
  "I mean, how many people are going to give an answer that's greater than zero to that question?",
  23.44,
  26.7
 ],
 [
  "Now what I want to do is give you guys a lesson regarding the quadratic formula that's a little bit different from the traditional approach.",
  27.62,
  33.54
 ],
 [
  "And the main thing I want to focus on is connecting it to other common patterns in math that are useful for general problem solving.",
  33.66,
  40.94
 ],
 [
  "Now the tactic that I'm going to talk through, it's not the usual completing the squares bit that some people will learn in high school.",
  41.44,
  46.64
 ],
 [
  "And when you learn that, you often think, okay, in principle, I could re-derive the quadratic formula, but frankly, it's going to be a bit of a pain.",
  46.88,
  53.1
 ],
 [
  "What I will talk about is somewhat similar to something that Po Shen-Lo put out a couple months ago.",
  53.74,
  59.62
 ],
 [
  "For those of you who don't know him, he has a YouTube channel, but more than that, he's the coach of the USIMO team, and he has a company called X-Py, does a lot of great math stuff.",
  59.74,
  68.28
 ],
 [
  "So he talked about kind of an alternate way that we could teach the quadratic formula.",
  68.74,
  72.06
 ],
 [
  "The way I'm going to talk about it is a little bit different from how he did, but certainly very similar in spirit.",
  72.74,
  77.02
 ],
 [
  "Again, the upshot that I want you guys to come away with is the fact that you should connect this to other common patterns in math so as to make yourself a better problem solver.",
  77.46,
  85.7

 [
  "And that should be the main takeaway lesson for, you know, this particular topic.",
  86.0,
  90.54

 [
  "Now these lectures in general, I'm going to be shooting for something roughly on the order of an hour for each one of them, and the dynamic that I'm going for is one where there's questions that I'm asking the audience, and then the audience interacts with it in a very, well, in a very live way.",
  91.14,
  105.72
 ],
 [
  "Now the thing about live stuff though is sometimes it doesn't go the way that you intended.",
  106.02,
  110.16
 ],
 [
  "So the general technology that we're going to have for this is going to involve me pulling up some kind of question, like for example right here, the question is asking kind of facetiously about your relationship with the quadratic formula.",
  110.58,
  123.0
 ],
 [
  "And I even had this going over the intro animation for you guys.",
  123.14,
  126.1
 ],
 [
  "And then what you see is the statistics associated with what the answers, you know, other people are entering are.",
  126.54,
  132.6

  "And they'll kind of get overlaid, we see the bars.",
  133.34,
  135.54

 [
  "At the moment all you see are question marks.",
  135.64,
  137.42

  "We don't know what the most common answer was, but at some point I can choose to grade that and then we'll see.",
  137.5,
  142.4

  "Except for the fact that it looks like there's quite a few of you guys and it's giving our servers a little bit of trouble.",
  142.86,
  147.54

  "So we have a couple people who are going to be working on that in the background.",
  148.08,
  151.62

  152.06,
  156.28

  "For this particular one, who knows, some magic might happen halfway through.",
  163.96,
  167.02
 ],
 [
  "But there's a lot of excitement among you guys right now which is awesome and I love that.",
  167.38,
  171.38
 ],
 [
  "And let's see if we can translate that into some of the math itself.",
  171.7,
  174.6
 ],
 [
  "So one of the questions that I was going to ask is how many times do you expect to use the quadratic formula?",
  175.56,
  181.12
 ],
 [
  "And when we were doing this a little bit earlier with a couple people, for sure the most common answer was zero.",
  181.56,
  187.4
 ],
 [
  "Zero times is when I think I'll use the quadratic formula outside of school.",
  187.76,
  191.08

 [
  "And a funny story about that, I actually was once giving this talk at Pixar where I brought it up as this example of something that we teach every student and it's unclear why.",

  202.02
 ],
 [
  "They're not going to use it.",
  202.42,
  203.54
 ],
 [
  "And I should have known better than to say this to a bunch of engineers at Pixar because one of them looked at me and he was like oh I'll have you know I actually use the quadratic formula all the time.",
  203.98,
  213.64
 ],
 [
  "His name was Tim Babb and he very kindly sent over basically a storyboard for a video, something I think he was pitching me on.",
  214.4,
  220.68
 ],
 [
  "And the basic idea he was talking through an image that he created purely with computer graphics.",
  221.58,
  226.46
 ],
 [
  "I think this is totally beautiful.",
  226.58,
  227.88
 ],
 [
  "You would think that this is a photograph of some reflective billiard balls but this is entirely computer graphics.",
  228.44,
  234.08
 ],
 [
  "And the tactics used behind this involve something called ray tracing.",
  234.78,
  238.38
 ],
 [
  "So the basic idea there is you sort of imagine a camera shooting out a bunch of rays through each pixel of your screen and then depending on whether it hits the sphere and how it hits the sphere that tells you how to color each pixel.",
  239.12,
  252.82
 ],
 [
  "Now part of that problem though is to know hey if I'm shooting a ray in some direction will it hit a given sphere?",
  252.82,
  259.26
 ],
 [
  "And so what you might do is define a certain vector, you might imagine an amount of time that the beam of light is moving, and then you can come up with a graph for how close is that ray to the sphere as a function of time.",
  259.94,
  272.7
 ],
 [
  "And in some cases if it passes through the sphere you're going to have two solutions there.",
  273.16,
  277.04
 ],
 [
  "And once you work out the math it turns out this is a quadratic equation so what you need is a systematic way to plug in these solutions to a quadratic equation and it needs to be programmatic it needs to be some kind of formula because you're doing this for every single pixel on the screen.",
  277.48,
  290.96
 ],
 [
  "You also need to be able to know is it just glancing off of the sphere or does it not go through it at all?",
  291.5,
  296.28
 ],
 [
  "And again all of that comes down to solving a quadratic.",
  296.44,
  298.96
 ],
 [
  "And this particular engineer at Pixar he did a loose back of the envelope calculation for me that suggested the movie Coco probably used the quadratic formula over a trillion times just given how many lights there are for every single frame in that shot.",
  299.6,
  313.24
 ],
 [
  "So in some very real sense the quadratic formula is useful to the point of being used a trillion times to produce a movie.",
  313.78,
  320.02
 ],
 [
  "Nevertheless I don't necessarily think that's representative of most people's future and it could be the case that the reason we teach people this formula is because maybe they happen to be that Pixar employee.",
  320.9,
  330.88
 ],
 [
  "You never know what's going to be useful.",
  331.04,
  332.26
 ],
 [
  "But I want to make the case again that we can connect it to other patterns and problem solving bits in math.",
  332.9,
  337.5
 ],
 [
  "And the way that I'm going to go about this is to start in a place that's frankly completely unrelated to quadratics and quadratic functions.",
  338.2,
  345.36
 ],
 [
  "I just want to talk about some mental math tricks.",
  345.52,
  347.7
 ],
 [
  "Because I think if you are thinking about arithmetic, something very basic, something we do in elementary school, and you think about it deeply enough, some of the patterns that you observe become relevant to stuff that you're doing later on.",
  348.7,
  364.04
 ],
 [
  "So for example let's say I ask you to factor the number 35.",
  364.44,
  367.38
 ],
 [
  "You know it's easy to see that five goes into it and goes into it seven times.",
  368.38,
  373.32
 ],
 [
  "Each of those is prime.",
  373.58,
  374.34
 ],
 [
  "Great!",
  374.8,
  374.96
 ],
 [
  "We know how to factor 35.",
  375.52,
  376.76
 ],
 [
  "Now factoring is kind of an annoying task the bigger the numbers get, especially if there's no obvious small factors that go into it.",
  377.62,
  383.5
 ],
 [
  "Because if I asked you, hey let's factor 143, I mean how do you go about it?",
  383.52,
  387.58
 ],
 [
  "I think the way a lot of us think about it is we initially think, okay, we know that two doesn't go into it because it's not even.",
  388.04,
  394.22
 ],
 [
  "Three, there's a nice divisibility check where you do one plus four plus three, and that sum in this case is five plus three or eight is not divisible by three, so that's out.",
  395.0,
  403.86
 ],
 [
  "Five we can see doesn't go into it.",
  404.48,
  406.12
 ],
 [
  "Seven, okay you have to think about that for a moment, but you might see that seven goes into 140 evenly because that's 20 times seven.",
  406.44,
  413.64
 ],
 [
  "Okay so that's right out.",
  413.8,
  414.7
 ],
 [
  "And at this point you might be annoyed with whoever was asking you the question, but if you go one step further you might see, okay 11.",
  415.24,
  421.06
 ],
 [
  "Actually 11 does go into it and it ends up being 11 times 13.",
  421.92,
  426.5
 ],
 [
  "I just love the fact that right now people probably have no idea what any of this has to do with the quadratic formula, but I assure you, highly related.",
  428.06,
  434.6
 ],
 [
  "Because what if I asked you 3,599?",
  435.56,
  438.58
 ],
 [
  "And this particular example isn't randomly chosen by the way.",
  440.06,
  442.56
 ],
 [
  "I was reading this article about a Russian programmer in an interview that he had, I think it was at Goldman Sachs, and he was describing kind of the intensity of that interview environment.",
  442.58,
  450.98
 ],
 [
  "And in one of them he just walks in the door, hadn't even met the person, and the person just shouts at him, factor 3,599.",
  451.54,
  457.54
 ],
 [
  "You know the programmer's like, uh, all right.",
  458.9,
  461.64
 ],
 [
  "And he actually was able to spit out the factors particularly quickly, which is impressive given the fact that if we imagine going through all of the different primes, you know, does two go into it?",
  461.92,
  470.78
 ],
 [
  "No.",
  470.84,
  470.96
 ],
 [
  "Does three go into it?",
  471.04,
  471.74
 ],
 [
  "No.",
  471.78,
  471.92
 ],
 [
  "Five?",
  472.26,
  471.74
 ],
 [
  "No.",
  471.78,
  472.78
 ],
 [
  "You're going to be sitting there for quite a while.",
  473.1,
  474.64
 ],
 [
  "So clearly something different was happening in his head, and the question is, what?",
  475.16,
  478.68
 ],
 [
  "Well one thing you might notice about the numbers that I've chosen here is that 35 is awfully close to a square.",
  480.06,
  485.9
 ],
 [
  "It's actually just one less than six squared.",
  486.9,
  488.54
 ],
 [
  "And maybe it kind of makes sense that its factors are each kind of close to six.",
  489.46,
  494.48
 ],
 [
  "You know, five times seven, it's probably not going to equal six times six, but the fact that they're of similar sizes should be intuitive, and as it happens it's precisely one less.",
  495.32,
  503.3
 ],
 [
  "And something similar happens with the other example I chose.",
  504.16,
  506.62
 ],
 [
  "143 is rather close to a square number, 144.",
  507.58,
  511.32
 ],
 [
  "In fact it's one less.",
  512.14,
  513.14
 ],
 [
  "And it's no coincidence that its two factors are hovering right around the square root of that value.",
  513.88,
  518.08
 ],
 [
  "One of them is 12 minus 1, and the other one is 12 plus 1.",
  518.5,
  522.02
 ],
 [
  "So it kind of makes sense that the product will be something around 12 times 12.",
  522.88,
  526.02
 ],
 [
  "And so from this you might make a guess that, hey, maybe any time that you have some number that's one less than a perfect square, and this, you know, it's suspiciously close to a very round seeming number, 3600.",
  527.16,
  539.24
 ],
 [
  "Well, what is 3600?",
  540.4,
  541.54
 ],
 [
  "We recognize the 36 as being six squared and 100 is 10 squared, so that's 60 times 60.",
  542.42,
  548.56
 ],
 [
  "And maybe you think, okay, the guess, if it's going to follow the same pattern as what we've seen above, is that this would be one less than 60 times one more than 60.",
  549.1,
  558.68
 ],
 [
  "But of course you don't just want a pattern match.",
  559.94,
  561.68
 ],
 [
  "Let's see if there's a nice reason that it's a true.",
  561.68,
  563.32
 ],
 [
  "You can work it out algebraically, which we will, but as you guys know I love animation, so let's just see if there's a nice visual way to understand this particular property.",
  563.78,
  571.66
 ],
 [
  "And if we're going to think about this, the natural place to turn is to think about squares.",
  572.7,
  576.28
 ],
 [
  "So let me just pull up an image of a square, and if we want to say, can I factor a number which is one less than a square, what I might have us imagine doing is taking the corner off of that square, okay?",
  576.66,
  588.86
 ],
 [
  "So let's say it's x by x, whatever x is, in this case it happens to be six, but you want to think a little bit more abstractly than that.",
  589.46,
  595.48
 ],
 [
  "And I'm going to take that bottom right corner, get it out of here, we don't want it.",
  595.74,
  599.3
 ],
 [
  "The question of factoring is to say, can I rearrange the quantity that remains into some kind of rectangle?",
  599.42,
  605.2
 ],
 [
  "And in this case if I take that bottom row, sloop it on up to the right, what you can see is it forms a rectangle, one with a side length x plus one, and another with a side length x minus one.",
  605.8,
  614.96
 ],
 [
  "So this general property holds quite well, and I think that's really cool, right?",
  615.8,
  619.9
 ],
 [
  "You see this visually, you see that it's this neat mental arithmetic trick where any time you have some sort of square number minus one, you can factor that as x plus one times x minus one.",
  620.06,
  631.3
 ],
 [
  "But of course we can go one step further than that if we really want to.",
  632.46,
  635.42
 ],
 [
  "It doesn't have to be one sitting there.",
  635.78,
  637.68
 ],
 [
  "If we go back to our diagram, what you might instead do is say, hey, what if I chopped off a bigger corner of that square?",
  637.84,
  644.54
 ],
 [
  "What if I wasn't taking x squared minus one, I was taking x squared minus y squared?",
  644.98,
  649.22
 ],
 [
  "Well, I can rearrange what remains into a rectangle where it's x plus y on one side and then x minus y on the other side.",
  649.72,
  657.2
 ],
 [
  "Now that's the geometric way that you can view it, which I think gives a certain satisfaction.",
  658.24,
  662.12
 ],
 [
  "And when we view it in terms of numbers, it gives us a reminder of how powerful it is.",
  662.58,
  666.7
 ],
 [
  "And yet somehow when we do this algebraically, the magic is a little bit lost.",
  666.8,
  671.7
 ],
 [
  "It's definitely easier to see, and that demonstrates the power of algebra.",
  671.7,
  675.48
 ],
 [
  "But if I just said x plus y times x minus y, actually, you know what, let me change the variable names there.",
  676.02,
  681.92
 ],
 [
  "I don't like x and y because those don't necessarily have the same meaning.",
  681.94,
  684.64
 ],
 [
  "What I might do is try to picture, you know, let's picture the original two numbers that we had, something that's like 59 and 61 on a number line.",
  685.04,
  695.64
 ],
 [
  "And I want to think in terms of the midpoint m and then the distance between m and each of the other numbers.",
  695.7,
  704.02
 ],
 [
  "So plus and minus d.",
  704.84,
  705.9
 ],
 [
  "In this case, d is just one, but in principle, it might be something more.",
  706.68,
  709.64
 ],
 [
  "So if I ask you multiply m minus d times m plus d, you know, at this point, it's pretty straightforward algebra.",
  710.06,
  717.76
 ],
 [
  "The first term is m times m.",
  718.28,
  719.9
 ],
 [
  "We get m squared.",
  719.94,
  720.9
 ],
 [
  "Next, we have negative d times m.",
  721.96,
  723.84
 ],
 [
  "So that's minus d m.",
  723.86,
  726.0
 ],
 [
  "Next, we have m times plus d, m plus d.",
  726.92,
  730.26

 [
  "That's plus d and then negative d times d.",
  730.68,
  733.14
 ],
 [
  "So minus d squared.",
  733.26,
  734.36

  "And indeed, what comes out is m squared minus d squared.",
  734.66,
  738.14

  "I guess some terms cancel out nicely.",
  746.26,
  747.8

 [
  "But the more you think about this, the more intriguing it is, because any two numbers we can express, you know, if I just take any numbers r and s, I could write that down as some midpoint plus or minus a distance.",
  748.14,
  760.4
 ],
 [
  "And what this is telling us is to think about products is always the same as thinking about a difference of squares, which is weird, because products can be very chaotic.",
  761.2,
  769.82
 ],
 [
  "If I just walk through the number line, and I don't know, we I say look at 101, 102, 103, and I just say, take a look at all the numbers on the number line.",
  769.86,
  779.54
 ],
 [
  "And I want you to systematically tell me, can each one of them be broken down as a product of two smaller whole numbers?",
  779.58,
  786.18
 ],
 [
  "Well, we know that what that's asking is, what are the primes?",
  786.74,
  790.06
 ],
 [
  "Because only the primes can't be broken down like that.",
  790.2,
  793.32
 ],
 [
  "And yet, evidently, that's a very similar question to saying, when can I walk through those numbers and say, hey, am I able to express you as a difference of squares?",
  793.84,
  801.34
 ],
 [
  "Could I add a square number to you to get another square?",
  801.56,
  803.68
 ],
 [
  "That still feels hard.",
  804.44,
  805.36
 ],
 [
  "But that feels like a very different question to me.",
  805.36,
  807.66

  "So I think if you were doing some arithmetic, and you had this in the back of your mind, that's a good pattern.",

  "So what's the task?",
  839.3,
  840.86

 [
  "Anytime you have some function that looks like ax squared plus bx plus c, okay, for any numbers a, b, and c.",
  842.5,

 [
  "So maybe that's something like 3x squared minus 4x plus 5.",
  849.96,
  854.86

 [
  "And you want to know when that equals zero, what are the two roots?",
  855.24,
  859.7

 [
  "Now, this is actually equivalent to rescaling everything.",
  860.72,
  864.04

  "And I think it's a good common pattern to rescaling, where I'm going to divide everything by a.",
  864.06,
  868.92

  869.36,
  870.84
 ],

  870.86,
  872.9

  881.26

 [
  "And this is a different function.",
  881.5,
  883.14

  "It is a different quadratic function, but the roots are going to be the same.",
  883.16,

  893.18,
  894.76

 [
  "In this case, I've written it so that one of the roots is going to be two and the other is four.",
  894.76,

  903.54
 ],
 [
  "It's exactly the same graph.",
  903.56,
  904.78

  905.46,

  "It is a different function, but the roots are still two and four.",
  927.92,
  931.06

  939.98,
  941.76

  "So going back to what we're working with here, the reason that I think it's much nicer to make sure that that leading coefficient is a one is because if we're thinking of our quadratic in terms of its roots, and I say, okay, you know, it's going to intersect the x-axis at r and s, or maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but let's just write one that does like this.",
  942.72,
  963.22
 ],
 [
  "Another way that I could express that particular quadratic is as x minus r times x minus s.",
  963.58,
  971.58

 [
  "Because if I plug in r, it's clear that we're going to get zero.",
  972.8,

  976.02,
  979.24

  "So if I expand this, whatever r and s are, they're the unknowns, I should get the same thing as what we have up here.",
  979.24,
  986.18
 ],
 [
  "And this is generally useful.",
  986.46,
  987.82
 ],
 [
  "This is not just for the quadratic formula, but a very good relationship to have with polynomials is to know how the roots correspond to the coefficients, especially in a circumstance where that leading coefficient is one, and the whole polynomial has been kind of normalized in that way.",
  987.86,
  1001.52
 ],
 [
  "And in this case, if you just expand it out, what we'll get is x squared minus r plus s times x, because we have this minus r times x and then x times minus s.",

  1032.96,
  1044.46
 ],
 [
  "Okay, and then similarly, c prime is going to be the product of those two roots, which is kind of cool, because what we have right here is, you know, it's a system that feels like it should have a solution.",
  1047.1,
  1062.62

 [
  "We have two equations and two unknowns, but it's not obvious how we would go about solving it.",

  1066.84,
  1073.98

  "So in some very fortunate circumstances, if you have something like, you know, x squared, let's see, minus 7x plus 12.",

  1097.32

  1110.66,
  1115.3

  "And in any case, what you're going to look for is a general formula anyway, so hope you had fun with that.",

  1131.3

 ],
 [
  "And you can see where this is going.",
  1142.94,
  1144.22

  1196.98,

  1214.04

  1228.72

  "Awesome, we know what m is.",

  "Maybe I'll change colors again, be a little flamboyant.",
  1258.82,
  1261.78

  1319.64,
  1322.38

  "We took the square root of the midpoint squared minus the product of the two.",
  1322.58,

  "So over in this example, the product of the two coefficients was seven.",
  1342.46,
  1346.78

  "So for me, what I think the simpler quadratic formula is, if you're going to memorize anything, is to come away and say it's m plus or minus the square root of m squared minus p.",
  1347.78,
  1358.68
 ],
 [
  "All you have to do is first find m, which is, you know, just a factor times one of the coefficients you're looking at, and then find p, which is also, if not already, a factor, a coefficient that you're looking at, a rescaling of one of them.",
