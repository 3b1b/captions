00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Hello and welcome to the very first episode of Lockdown Math.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,950
So in this first lecture, what I'm going to talk 

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,760
with you guys about is the quadratic formula.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,726
And traditionally, I think the quadratic formula is 

5
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:13,320
one of the most famously memorized things in high school.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,100
We almost all kind of have this song that sings in our head related to it.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,100
And yet, if you actually ask someone, how often do you 

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,780
expect you're going to be using this in the real world?

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,243
I mean, how many people are going to give an answer 

10
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,700
that's greater than zero to that question?

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,664
Now what I want to do is give you guys a lesson regarding the quadratic 

12
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,540
formula that's a little bit different from the traditional approach.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,189
And the main thing I want to focus on is connecting it to other 

14
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:40,940
common patterns in math that are useful for general problem solving.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,237
Now the tactic that I'm going to talk through, 

16
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:46,640
it's not the usual completing the squares bit that some people will learn in high school.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,468
And when you learn that, you often think, okay, in principle, 

18
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:53,100
I could re-derive the quadratic formula, but frankly, it's going to be a bit of a pain.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,444
What I will talk about is somewhat similar to 

20
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:59,620
something that Po Shen-Lo put out a couple months ago.

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,696
For those of you who don't know him, he has a YouTube channel, 

22
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,229
but more than that, he's the coach of the USIMO team, 

23
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:08,280
and he has a company called X-Py, does a lot of great math stuff.

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,060
So he talked about kind of an alternate way that we could teach the quadratic formula.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,642
The way I'm going to talk about it is a little bit different from how he did, 

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,020
but certainly very similar in spirit.

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,394
Again, the upshot that I want you guys to come away with is the fact that you should 

28
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:25,375
connect this to other common patterns in math so as to make yourself a better problem 

29
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:25,700
solver.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,540
And that should be the main takeaway lesson for, you know, this particular topic.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,587
Now these lectures in general, I'm going to be shooting for something 

32
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:37,247
roughly on the order of an hour for each one of them, 

33
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:40,942
and the dynamic that I'm going for is one where there's questions that I'm 

34
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:44,488
asking the audience, and then the audience interacts with it in a very, 

35
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:45,720
well, in a very live way.

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,340
Now the thing about live stuff though is sometimes 

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,160
it doesn't go the way that you intended.

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,720
So the general technology that we're going to have for this is going to involve 

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,135
me pulling up some kind of question, like for example right here, 

40
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:02,068
the question is asking kind of facetiously about your relationship with the 

41
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:03,000
quadratic formula.

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,100
And I even had this going over the intro animation for you guys.

43
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,473
And then what you see is the statistics associated with what the answers, 

44
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,600
you know, other people are entering are.

45
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,540
And they'll kind of get overlaid, we see the bars.

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,420
At the moment all you see are question marks.

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,574
We don't know what the most common answer was, 

48
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:22,400
but at some point I can choose to grade that and then we'll see.

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,219
Except for the fact that it looks like there's quite a few of 

50
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,540
you guys and it's giving our servers a little bit of trouble.

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,620
So we have a couple people who are going to be working on that in the background.

52
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,280
In the meantime I'll just be asking the questions that are pushing us through the lesson.

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,780
For future streams this will hopefully be a much more dynamic situation 

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,860
where as you answer we're kind of grading it and you see how it's going.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,020
For this particular one, who knows, some magic might happen halfway through.

56
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,380
But there's a lot of excitement among you guys right now which is awesome and I love that.

57
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,600
And let's see if we can translate that into some of the math itself.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,365
So one of the questions that I was going to ask is how 

59
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:01,120
many times do you expect to use the quadratic formula?

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,262
And when we were doing this a little bit earlier with a couple people, 

61
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,400
for sure the most common answer was zero.

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,080
Zero times is when I think I'll use the quadratic formula outside of school.

63
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,583
And a funny story about that, I actually was once giving this talk at Pixar where I 

64
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:21,783
brought it up as this example of something that we teach every student and it's unclear 

65
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:22,020
why.

66
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,540
They're not going to use it.

67
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,944
And I should have known better than to say this to a bunch of 

68
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:30,196
engineers at Pixar because one of them looked at me and he was like 

69
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:33,640
oh I'll have you know I actually use the quadratic formula all the time.

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,702
His name was Tim Babb and he very kindly sent over basically a storyboard for a video, 

71
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,680
something I think he was pitching me on.

72
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,145
And the basic idea he was talking through an image 

73
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,460
that he created purely with computer graphics.

74
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,880
I think this is totally beautiful.

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,431
You would think that this is a photograph of some reflective 

76
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,080
billiard balls but this is entirely computer graphics.

77
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,380
And the tactics used behind this involve something called ray tracing.

78
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,628
So the basic idea there is you sort of imagine a camera shooting out a bunch 

79
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:08,311
of rays through each pixel of your screen and then depending on whether it hits 

80
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:12,820
the sphere and how it hits the sphere that tells you how to color each pixel.

81
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,870
Now part of that problem though is to know hey if I'm 

82
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,260
shooting a ray in some direction will it hit a given sphere?

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,972
And so what you might do is define a certain vector, 

84
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:26,978
you might imagine an amount of time that the beam of light is moving, 

85
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:31,040
and then you can come up with a graph for how close is that ray to the 

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,700
sphere as a function of time.

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,291
And in some cases if it passes through the sphere 

88
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,040
you're going to have two solutions there.

89
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,850
And once you work out the math it turns out this is a quadratic equation 

90
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,035
so what you need is a systematic way to plug in these solutions to a 

91
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,313
quadratic equation and it needs to be programmatic it needs to be some 

92
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:50,960
kind of formula because you're doing this for every single pixel on the screen.

93
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,867
You also need to be able to know is it just glancing 

94
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,280
off of the sphere or does it not go through it at all?

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
And again all of that comes down to solving a quadratic.

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,218
And this particular engineer at Pixar he did a loose back of the envelope calculation 

97
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:08,514
for me that suggested the movie Coco probably used the quadratic formula over a 

98
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:13,240
trillion times just given how many lights there are for every single frame in that shot.

99
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,951
So in some very real sense the quadratic formula is useful to 

100
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:20,020
the point of being used a trillion times to produce a movie.

101
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,179
Nevertheless I don't necessarily think that's representative of most 

102
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:27,648
people's future and it could be the case that the reason we teach people 

103
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:30,880
this formula is because maybe they happen to be that Pixar employee.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,260
You never know what's going to be useful.

105
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,200
But I want to make the case again that we can connect 

106
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,500
it to other patterns and problem solving bits in math.

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,602
And the way that I'm going to go about this is to start in a place 

108
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:45,360
that's frankly completely unrelated to quadratics and quadratic functions.

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,700
I just want to talk about some mental math tricks.

110
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,517
Because I think if you are thinking about arithmetic, something very basic, 

111
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:58,335
something we do in elementary school, and you think about it deeply enough, 

112
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:04,040
some of the patterns that you observe become relevant to stuff that you're doing later on.

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,380
So for example let's say I ask you to factor the number 35.

114
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,320
You know it's easy to see that five goes into it and goes into it seven times.

115
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,340
Each of those is prime.

116
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:14,960
Great!

117
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,760
We know how to factor 35.

118
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,714
Now factoring is kind of an annoying task the bigger the numbers get, 

119
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,500
especially if there's no obvious small factors that go into it.

120
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,580
Because if I asked you, hey let's factor 143, I mean how do you go about it?

121
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,177
I think the way a lot of us think about it is we initially think, 

122
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:34,220
okay, we know that two doesn't go into it because it's not even.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,050
Three, there's a nice divisibility check where you do one plus four plus three, 

124
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,151
and that sum in this case is five plus three or eight is not divisible by three, 

125
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:43,860
so that's out.

126
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Five we can see doesn't go into it.

127
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,373
Seven, okay you have to think about that for a moment, 

128
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:53,640
but you might see that seven goes into 140 evenly because that's 20 times seven.

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,700
Okay so that's right out.

130
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,732
And at this point you might be annoyed with whoever was asking you the question, 

131
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:01,060
but if you go one step further you might see, okay 11.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,500
Actually 11 does go into it and it ends up being 11 times 13.

133
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,351
I just love the fact that right now people probably have no idea what any of 

134
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:14,600
this has to do with the quadratic formula, but I assure you, highly related.

135
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,580
Because what if I asked you 3,599?

136
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,560
And this particular example isn't randomly chosen by the way.

137
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,249
I was reading this article about a Russian programmer in an interview that he had, 

138
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,034
I think it was at Goldman Sachs, and he was describing kind of 

139
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,980
the intensity of that interview environment.

140
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,179
And in one of them he just walks in the door, hadn't even met the person, 

141
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,540
and the person just shouts at him, factor 3,599.

142
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,640
You know the programmer's like, uh, all right.

143
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,097
And he actually was able to spit out the factors particularly quickly, 

144
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,139
which is impressive given the fact that if we imagine going through 

145
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,780
all of the different primes, you know, does two go into it?

146
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:50,960
No.

147
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,740
Does three go into it?

148
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:51,920
No.

149
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:51,740
Five?

150
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
No.

151
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,640
You're going to be sitting there for quite a while.

152
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,680
So clearly something different was happening in his head, and the question is, what?

153
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,927
Well one thing you might notice about the numbers that 

154
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:05,900
I've chosen here is that 35 is awfully close to a square.

155
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,540
It's actually just one less than six squared.

156
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,480
And maybe it kind of makes sense that its factors are each kind of close to six.

157
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,652
You know, five times seven, it's probably not going to equal six times six, 

158
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:21,458
but the fact that they're of similar sizes should be intuitive, 

159
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,300
and as it happens it's precisely one less.

160
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,620
And something similar happens with the other example I chose.

161
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,320
143 is rather close to a square number, 144.

162
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
In fact it's one less.

163
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,917
And it's no coincidence that its two factors are 

164
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:38,080
hovering right around the square root of that value.

165
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,020
One of them is 12 minus 1, and the other one is 12 plus 1.

166
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,020
So it kind of makes sense that the product will be something around 12 times 12.

167
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,066
And so from this you might make a guess that, hey, 

168
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:54,624
maybe any time that you have some number that's one less than a perfect square, 

169
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:59,240
and this, you know, it's suspiciously close to a very round seeming number, 3600.

170
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,540
Well, what is 3600?

171
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,560
We recognize the 36 as being six squared and 100 is 10 squared, so that's 60 times 60.

172
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,803
And maybe you think, okay, the guess, if it's going to follow the same pattern as 

173
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:18,680
what we've seen above, is that this would be one less than 60 times one more than 60.

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,680
But of course you don't just want a pattern match.

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's see if there's a nice reason that it's a true.

176
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,787
You can work it out algebraically, which we will, but as you guys know I love animation, 

177
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:31,660
so let's just see if there's a nice visual way to understand this particular property.

178
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,723
And if we're going to think about this, the natural 

179
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:36,280
place to turn is to think about squares.

180
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,726
So let me just pull up an image of a square, and if we want to say, 

181
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:44,015
can I factor a number which is one less than a square, 

182
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:48,860
what I might have us imagine doing is taking the corner off of that square, okay?

183
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,799
So let's say it's x by x, whatever x is, in this case it happens to be six, 

184
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,480
but you want to think a little bit more abstractly than that.

185
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,300
And I'm going to take that bottom right corner, get it out of here, we don't want it.

186
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,282
The question of factoring is to say, can I rearrange 

187
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:05,200
the quantity that remains into some kind of rectangle?

188
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,264
And in this case if I take that bottom row, sloop it on up to the right, 

189
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:12,919
what you can see is it forms a rectangle, one with a side length x plus one, 

190
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,960
and another with a side length x minus one.

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,900
So this general property holds quite well, and I think that's really cool, right?

192
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,509
You see this visually, you see that it's this neat mental 

193
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:28,207
arithmetic trick where any time you have some sort of square number minus one, 

194
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:31,300
you can factor that as x plus one times x minus one.

195
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,420
But of course we can go one step further than that if we really want to.

196
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,680
It doesn't have to be one sitting there.

197
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,354
If we go back to our diagram, what you might instead do is say, 

198
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:44,540
hey, what if I chopped off a bigger corner of that square?

199
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,220
What if I wasn't taking x squared minus one, I was taking x squared minus y squared?

200
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,305
Well, I can rearrange what remains into a rectangle where 

201
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:57,200
it's x plus y on one side and then x minus y on the other side.

202
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,345
Now that's the geometric way that you can view it, 

203
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,120
which I think gives a certain satisfaction.

204
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,700
And when we view it in terms of numbers, it gives us a reminder of how powerful it is.

205
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,700
And yet somehow when we do this algebraically, the magic is a little bit lost.

206
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,480
It's definitely easier to see, and that demonstrates the power of algebra.

207
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,997
But if I just said x plus y times x minus y, actually, 

208
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:21,920
you know what, let me change the variable names there.

209
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't like x and y because those don't necessarily have the same meaning.

210
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,267
What I might do is try to picture, you know, let's picture the original 

211
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:35,640
two numbers that we had, something that's like 59 and 61 on a number line.

212
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,974
And I want to think in terms of the midpoint m and then 

213
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:44,020
the distance between m and each of the other numbers.

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,900
So plus and minus d.

215
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,640
In this case, d is just one, but in principle, it might be something more.

216
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,566
So if I ask you multiply m minus d times m plus d, 

217
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:57,760
you know, at this point, it's pretty straightforward algebra.

218
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,900
The first term is m times m.

219
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,900
We get m squared.

220
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Next, we have negative d times m.

221
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,000
So that's minus d m.

222
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,260
Next, we have m times plus d, m plus d.

223
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,140
That's plus d and then negative d times d.

224
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,360
So minus d squared.

225
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,140
And indeed, what comes out is m squared minus d squared.

226
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,992
And if you're anything like me, the first time you see this in an algebra class, 

227
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,420
it's just one of a whole bunch of exercises that you're doing.

228
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
You're like, yeah, okay, can expand this one way.

229
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,800
I guess some terms cancel out nicely.

230
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,691
But the more you think about this, the more intriguing it is, 

231
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:36,618
because any two numbers we can express, you know, if I just take any numbers r and s, 

232
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:40,400
I could write that down as some midpoint plus or minus a distance.

233
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,560
And what this is telling us is to think about products is always the same as thinking 

234
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,820
about a difference of squares, which is weird, because products can be very chaotic.

235
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,824
If I just walk through the number line, and I don't know, we I say look at 101, 

236
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:59,540
102, 103, and I just say, take a look at all the numbers on the number line.

237
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,770
And I want you to systematically tell me, can each one of 

238
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,180
them be broken down as a product of two smaller whole numbers?

239
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,060
Well, we know that what that's asking is, what are the primes?

240
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,320
Because only the primes can't be broken down like that.

241
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,641
And yet, evidently, that's a very similar question to saying, 

242
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,990
when can I walk through those numbers and say, hey, 

243
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,340
am I able to express you as a difference of squares?

244
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,680
Could I add a square number to you to get another square?

245
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
That still feels hard.

246
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,660
But that feels like a very different question to me.

247
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,586
So I think if you were doing some arithmetic, and you had this in the back of your mind, 

248
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,780
that's a good pattern.

249
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,920
And that's a pattern that's going to come up later in life.

250
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,540
For example, let's say later in life, you find 

251
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,820
yourself wanting to understand quadratic functions.

252
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,878
And so here, we're going to talk about the simpler version of the quadratic formula, 

253
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:49,080
which is really just refactoring the original thing.

254
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,020
But I hope you see, it's much easier to actually solve a random quadratic that's 

255
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,880
thrown at you, if you're going by the method that I want to show you right here.

256
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,860
So what's the task?

257
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,542
Anytime you have some function that looks like ax squared plus bx plus c, 

258
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,860
okay, for any numbers a, b, and c.

259
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,860
So maybe that's something like 3x squared minus 4x plus 5.

260
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,700
And you want to know when that equals zero, what are the two roots?

261
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,040
Now, this is actually equivalent to rescaling everything.

262
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,771
And I think it's a good common pattern to rescaling, 

263
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:28,920
where I'm going to divide everything by a.

264
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
So I just want that first coefficient to be equal to a.

265
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,900
Because that's way easier to work with.

266
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,302
So I'm going to call that x squared plus b prime x plus c prime, 

267
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:41,260
where b prime and c prime are just the rescaled versions there.

268
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,140
And this is a different function.

269
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,420
It is a different quadratic function, but the roots are going to be the same.

270
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,320
And one way that you might see this is if you just graph them.

271
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,700
So let's go over and pull up our best friend of Desmos, right?

272
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,760
So let's say I have some kind of parabola.

273
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,730
In this case, I've written it so that one of the 

274
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,620
roots is going to be two and the other is four.

275
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,540
And then g of x here is just the scaled version of the expanded version of that.

276
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,780
It's exactly the same graph.

277
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,800
But let's say I wanted to scale that up and down, right?

278
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,900
So I might take this and then I will multiply it by some kind of constant.

279
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,640
What do you guys want to call that constant?

280
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,720
See, this is the thing.

281
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,396
If I had the question framework working right now, 

282
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,280
I could just ask you, what do you want the constant to be?

283
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,740
And we would see the statistics come up with what people had.

284
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,780
But instead, maybe I'll throw in a slider.

285
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,920
And as I change that, the function changes.

286
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,060
It is a different function, but the roots are still two and four.

287
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,600
So solving for this rescaled version of the quadratic is the same.

288
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,940
And that should kind of make sense because s times zero is always going to be zero.

289
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,760
So it doesn't matter how much we scale it.

290
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,374
So going back to what we're working with here, 

291
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:49,383
the reason that I think it's much nicer to make sure that that leading 

292
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:54,466
coefficient is a one is because if we're thinking of our quadratic in terms of its roots, 

293
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:58,645
and I say, okay, you know, it's going to intersect the x-axis at r and s, 

294
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:03,220
or maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but let's just write one that does like this.

295
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,887
Another way that I could express that particular 

296
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:11,580
quadratic is as x minus r times x minus s.

297
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,540
Because if I plug in r, it's clear that we're going to get zero.

298
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,240
And if I plug in s, again, this term will also cancel out to zero.

299
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,095
So if I expand this, whatever r and s are, they're the unknowns, 

300
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:26,180
I should get the same thing as what we have up here.

301
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,820
And this is generally useful.

302
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,322
This is not just for the quadratic formula, but a very good relationship 

303
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:35,211
to have with polynomials is to know how the roots correspond to the coefficients, 

304
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,437
especially in a circumstance where that leading coefficient is one, 

305
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:41,520
and the whole polynomial has been kind of normalized in that way.

306
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,540
And in this case, if you just expand it out, what we'll get is x squared minus 

307
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,940
r plus s times x, because we have this minus r times x and then x times minus s.

308
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,403
And then the constant term will be negative r times negative s, 

309
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,660
so that becomes a positive r times s.

310
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,339
Okay, so what does this tell us?

311
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,548
This tells us the first two of the three key facts that are needed to be 

312
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:12,460
able to solve any quadratic without really needing to memorize all that much.

313
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,107
So the first key fact is that this b value, I'll call it b prime, 

314
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:21,380
just to remind ourselves that it's after you've scaled things down, 

315
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,460
is the same as the negative sum of the two roots.

316
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:33,202
Okay, and then similarly, c prime is going to be the product of those two roots, 

317
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:38,400
which is kind of cool, because what we have right here is, you know, 

318
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,620
it's a system that feels like it should have a solution.

319
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,829
We have two equations and two unknowns, but it's 

320
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,840
not obvious how we would go about solving it.

321
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,145
And every now and then, I think classes will have a unit in factoring quadratics, 

322
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,980
where they basically tell you to just guess and check.

323
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,496
So in some very fortunate circumstances, if you have something like, 

324
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:03,300
you know, x squared, let's see, minus 7x plus 12.

325
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,685
They basically say, see if you can guess and find two 

326
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:11,640
different numbers that add up to be 7 and that multiply to be 12.

327
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,700
And if you just kind of sit back there and think, you're like, 

328
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,320
okay, can I find any two numbers that add to 7 and multiply to 12?

329
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,180
Well factoring 12, we get 3 and 4, and 3 and 4 do add to 7.

330
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,420
So yeah, in that case, you just totally luck out.

331
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,220
And you could write this as x minus 3 and x minus 4, because those are the two roots.

332
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,998
And then you typically move on from that chapter and it's like, 

333
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:35,300
well, in most cases, you won't be able to just guess and check.

334
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,969
And in any case, what you're going to look for is a general formula anyway, 

335
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,220
so hope you had fun with that.

336
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,726
But it turns out there's actually a systematic way to take this puzzle of finding 

337
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:51,300
two numbers that have a known sum and a known product and figure out what they are.

338
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,213
And the key comes down to thinking in terms of not the two numbers themselves, 

339
00:18:56,213 --> 00:19:01,041
but the mean of those two numbers, and then the distance between that mean and each one 

340
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:01,480
of them.

341
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,220
And you can see where this is going.

342
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,809
This is why we talked about difference of squares, 

343
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,695
because the third key fact to come away with, or to come into it with, 

344
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:18,820
I should maybe say, is that we could re-express that product as m minus d times m plus d.

345
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,140
And you see where I'm going, right?

346
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,480
That means that the product that we know looks like m squared minus d squared.

347
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,660
So just to give an example here, it's often much more helpful to have numbers.

348
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,950
Let's say that you were given a quadratic like x squared, I don't know, 

349
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,680
let's do six, even numbers will make this easier for us, and then seven.

350
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,080
And you were tasked with knowing when does this equal zero?

351
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,341
So I haven't told you how to solve it yet, but these three key facts 

352
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:56,080
are going to be enough to just basically walk yourself into the answer.

353
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,340
Well, what is m, right?

354
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,020
As m plus or minus d for some kind of midpoint.

355
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,280
Well, that midpoint is the sum of the two numbers over two.

356
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,040
That's how we define averages.

357
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,513
And because we know the sum of the two numbers is negative b prime, 

358
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:22,880
that's the same as negative b prime over two, which you can basically read off of the 

359
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,587
equation as just negative one half times whatever's sitting right there, 

360
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:28,720
which in this case will be negative three.

361
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,960
Awesome, we know what m is.

362
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,780
But look at the equation we have up here.

363
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,806
We have an expression for c, the last coefficient, in terms of m, 

364
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,640
which we now know, and d, which is the only thing we don't know left.

365
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,451
So we could rearrange this, and so that was saying c prime is that, 

366
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:50,985
we could say that d squared, the square of this kind of standard deviation 

367
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:55,580
between our roots, is m squared minus c prime, the product of the two roots.

368
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,820
But we know both of those values, we could just write that down over here.

369
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,780
Maybe I'll change colors again, be a little flamboyant.

370
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,706
d squared is equal to m squared, which in our example turns out to be nine, 

371
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:11,380
minus c prime, which is that last coefficient, or seven.

372
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,120
Seven.

373
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,160
Handwriting is terrible, but I think you guys can work with me.

374
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
You see why I usually animate stuff.

375
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
So that means that's two.

376
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,903
So look, when we said r and s is some midpoint plus or minus a distance, 

377
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:31,144
that midpoint is negative three, plus or minus, well if d squared is two, 

378
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:33,380
that means d is the square root of two.

379
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,680
There you go.

380
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,420
You could do that for any quadratic that I give you.

381
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
You could just walk through that particular process.

382
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,218
And let me just show you what it looks like in general, 

383
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,120
so that you can maybe remember it as a formula if you wanted to.

384
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,400
In general, for any quadratic, that midpoint is just the rescaled 

385
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,560
version of b if the leading coefficient wasn't already one, divided by two.

386
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,380
And then that distance, well what did we just do?

387
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:10,220
We took the square root of the midpoint squared minus the product of the two.

388
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,199
And when I'm sort of thinking into my head, I've been saying like m squared minus p, 

389
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,800
just because p has a readable meaning.

390
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I think of it as the midpoint squared minus the product.

391
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,521
But of course p in this context is just whatever 

392
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:22,460
the last coefficient of our quadratic was.

393
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,780
So over in this example, the product of the two coefficients was seven.

394
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,331
So for me, what I think the simpler quadratic formula is, 

395
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:36,659
if you're going to memorize anything, is to come away and say it's m plus or minus the 

396
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,680
square root of m squared minus p.

397
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,708
All you have to do is first find m, which is, you know, 

398
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:47,005
just a factor times one of the coefficients you're looking at, and then find p, 

399
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:51,249
which is also, if not already, a factor, a coefficient that you're looking at, 

400
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,700
a rescaling of one of them.

401
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,160
So this to me is way simpler than the traditional quadratic formula.

402
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,360
And if you were to try to sing a song to yourself for it, the song is almost too short.

403
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,900
It's no fun.

404
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,900
You're just sitting there like m plus or minus square root of m squared minus p.

405
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,840
That's it.

406
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,700
No song.

407
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,640
No song to be had.

408
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,720
So let's do a couple practice problems, because I do think practice will make it easier.

409
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,649
And for future streams, again, it'll ultimately be the case that I'm giving you 

410
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:20,240
these questions, and then you'll be able to go to 3b1b.co.live and answer them.

411
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,520
But because there's too many of you, we can't have any fun today.

412
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,531
This is the equivalent of trying to run a class where you have, you know, 

413
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,320
I don't know, 20 seats sitting out and you're going to do a normal lecture.

414
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,598
And then there's just people banging at the doors and trying to cram themselves in, 

415
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:35,740
and the fire marshal comes in and they're like, ah, you got to cut out the class.

416
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,660
You can't have this the way that you hoped for.

417
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,700
But it's cool that there's so many of you here enthusiastic to learn about math.

418
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,680
So let's just do some examples.

419
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,080
Okay.

420
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,920
That'll kind of highlight what this process looks like.

421
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,680
Let's say we had x squared plus 10x plus three.

422
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,360
So in this case, it's nicely already rescaled for us.

423
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,220
That's always lovely.

424
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,591
So I often, I just like to draw the picture for myself, 

425
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,740
whether or not the two roots turn out to be real or even positive.

426
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,040
It's just nice to remind myself what we're looking for.

427
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,100
We're looking for where the two roots are.

428
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,439
And I know that a different way to think about 

429
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,740
products is to think about a difference of squares.

430
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,844
So I just kind of think in my head, okay, I'll be thinking of 

431
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:19,000
that in terms of their mean and the kind of standard deviation.

432
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,040
So I just write down for myself, what does that mean?

433
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,860
Well, it's negative b prime over two.

434
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,477
And if I forget that fact, if I forget that that's what the sum of the two roots is, 

435
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:34,306
I could always just go through this little rigmarole again and say, okay, 

436
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,824
if I systematically wanted it to be a quadratic with roots r and s, 

437
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,480
this is what it would look like.

438
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,800
This is how it would expand.

439
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,280
So you can re-derive it on the fly.

440
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,740
There's not too much memorization needed.

441
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,980
In this context, that works out to be negative five.

442
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,044
And by the way, if I do ever make any mistakes, 

443
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:52,851
which I'm quite positive I will, go ahead and throw them in the 

444
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,360
chat and those will be forwarded to me and I'll be able to correct myself there.

445
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,940
So we know the midpoint.

446
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,260
And then we just ask ourselves, what's the square of the distance?

447
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,604
And based on difference of squares, that'll be that midpoint squared minus the product, 

448
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:13,107
which in this context is negative five squared or 25 minus the product, 

449
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:15,860
which is that last coefficient, minus three.

450
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,640
So what are the roots r and s?

451
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:27,240
Well, it's negative five plus or minus the square root of 25 minus three or 22.

452
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,540
There you go.

453
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,060
Another quadratic solved.

454
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,180
Ain't no thing.

455
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,660
Let's try another.

456
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,380
Just because I do think it's kind of nice to get a little bit of practice here.

457
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,880
And as I'm going, if you have a piece of paper and pencil, please follow along.

458
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,740
If you can just kind of race ahead and do the same process before I do it, that's awesome.

459
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,740
That is the best kind of learning experience.

460
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,461
If you're watching this in the future, by the way, 

461
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:53,600
as with any video, I highly encourage you to pause and ponder.

462
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,780
I really think that's the best way to learn math.

463
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,342
If you're looking at some kind of lecture in those crucial 

464
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:00,383
moments where there's a question asked, pause, 

465
00:26:00,383 --> 00:26:03,640
see if you can do it yourself and then see what the answer turns out to be.

466
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,860
I guarantee you'll learn more effectively that way.

467
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,360
I don't know.

468
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,900
What should we do?

469
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,960
Let's do maybe three x squared.

470
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,060
I think I wrote one down earlier, didn't I?

471
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,940
Just as kind of a offhanded thing.

472
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,360
What did I write?

473
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,980
That wasn't there.

474
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,900
Oh yeah, it was at the top.

475
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,000
Let's do that one.

476
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,680
Three x squared minus four x plus five.

477
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,720
Why not?

478
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,860
Three x squared minus four x plus five.

479
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,320
All right.

480
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,360
So in this case, step one, we've got to rescale things.

481
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,560
The first one gives the coefficients a nice readable meaning.

482
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:41,720
Minus four thirds x plus five thirds.

483
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:42,580
Great.

484
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,860
And now same process.

485
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,903
I'm sort of thinking in my head of this particular 

486
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:48,920
image where I want to know the midpoint and the distance.

487
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,160
So I say that midpoint is negative of this second coefficient divided by two.

488
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,160
So that will become positive four thirds.

489
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,420
But then that four divided by two gives us a two.

490
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,080
So that midpoint will be two thirds.

491
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,687
And then the distance squared is m squared minus the product, 

492
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:10,280
which in this case is five thirds.

493
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,120
Okay.

494
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,460
And m squared in this case is, let's see, two thirds squared minus five thirds.

495
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,680
All right.

496
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,940
So this one, you know, it gets a little messier.

497
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,580
We've got to work out our fractions, but that's not too bad.

498
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,940
Two thirds squared is going to be four ninths.

499
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,980
Oh, I'm off screen a little.

500
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,320
And then what is five thirds in terms of ninths?

501
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,940
That's going to be fifteen ninths if I'm not wrong.

502
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
So we end up getting a negative number, which is always fun.

503
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,820
So here we have negative eleven ninths.

504
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:45,900
Okay.

505
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,960
So what that means is that our final answer, the roots of this polynomial are in s.

506
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,299
The values that will make the polynomial zero are going to be 

507
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:01,680
two thirds plus or minus the square root of negative eleven over d.

508
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,520
Negative eleven over d.

509
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,920
What am I saying?

510
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,540
Negative eleven over nine.

511
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,820
Okay.

512
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,400
So that's fun.

513
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,180
In this case, the square root is a negative.

514
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,240
So that means we have complex roots.

515
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,183
And there's actually a very fun way to think about the way that complex roots 

516
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:19,640
play into this difference of squares perspective on the quadratic formula.

517
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,933
Let me actually try it with a simpler example, 

518
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:25,184
but it ends up relating to the Pythagorean theorem, 

519
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:28,169
which I think is cool because the whole purpose of this is to try to 

520
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:30,420
connect various patterns in math that come up a lot.

521
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,940
Things that might be useful outside of this particular class that you're doing.

522
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,157
So I actually have written down for myself an 

523
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:39,220
example that will work out with nice numbers here.

524
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,000
I mean nice-ish.

525
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,340
X squared minus six x plus ten.

526
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,640
Okay.

527
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,760
So we go through the same rigmarole.

528
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,700
We say m, the midpoint, is going to be negative b prime over two.

529
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,979
So in that case, it works out to just be three because 

530
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:57,040
we take the negative of this term and divide by two.

531
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,920
d squared is going to be m squared.

532
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,620
So three squared is nine minus the product, which in this case is ten.

533
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,294
So nicely that's exactly negative one, which means that our two roots, 

534
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:16,929
and I'm down to the y or on the page that I've been writing with here, 

535
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,540
our two roots are three plus or minus i.

536
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:20,880
Okay.

537
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,375
So what that means for us is that the actual parabola here, 

538
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,580
it doesn't look like something that crosses the x-axis.

539
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,820
Instead it would be something that maybe sits above it.

540
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,680
But it does have imaginary roots.

541
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,826
So if we were to look at the input space, not just in terms of the real number line, 

542
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:37,900
but let me draw it out.

543
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,340
Let me go back to black.

544
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,920
Black will be our complex plane color for this moment.

545
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,430
We'll call this our imaginary axis, where numbers like i and negative i, 

546
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:55,120
the square root of one, or maybe I should say square roots of one, it's got two of them.

547
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
You interchange them, it's fine.

548
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,740
And then we've got just the real numbers.

549
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,840
One, two, three, four.

550
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,520
So in this case, our two roots live at three plus i and three minus i.

551
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,720
So this, I should be very clear, this is not an x-axis and a y-axis.

552
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,100
This entire plane now is where the input lives, where x lives.

553
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,820
If you were going to graph it, you'd get some kind of graph that's outside of the paper.

554
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,376
And any of you who've watched the channel Welsh Labs, which if you haven't, 

555
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:27,740
you absolutely should, might be bringing to mind right now an absolutely awesome 

556
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,980
like artificial reality effect he does, where he sort of pulls out that graph.

557
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
Highly worth watching, super great moment.

558
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,020
But what's interesting about this is if we look at the magnitude of the roots, okay?

559
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
Because I could ask you, what is the magnitude of that root?

560
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,700
And it's a right triangle that we're looking at.

561
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,560
We've switched from algebra to geometry now.

562
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,520
And based on the Pythagorean theorem, it'll be the square root 

563
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,407
of one of the lengths squared, which is in this case three squared, 

564
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:59,380
plus the other length squared, which is one squared.

565
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,520
So square root of three squared plus one squared, and that ends up being root 10.

566
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,009
It is not a coincidence at all that the magnitude of our roots, 

567
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:14,436
I guess sort of no pun intended, the magnitude of the roots of our 

568
00:31:14,436 --> 00:31:19,260
quadratic equation here are the square root of that constant coefficient.

569
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,953
Because remember that constant coefficient is 

570
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:24,180
telling us what is the product of the two roots.

571
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,061
And if you know something about complex numbers, 

572
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:30,884
you might know that if I have two complex numbers and I multiply them together, 

573
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:34,420
the magnitude of the product is the same as the product of the magnitudes.

574
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,764
So in this case, given that I'm going to have two separate roots who are symmetric, 

575
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:43,585
you know, it's going to be three plus or minus some imaginary number, 

576
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,260
each of them is going to have the same magnitude.

577
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,000
The product of their magnitudes needs to be 10.

578
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,120
We know that offhand.

579
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,880
So you kind of know ahead of time that it should be magnitude of square root of 10.

580
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:01,518
And the reason that this is happening is basically because when you do 

581
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:07,935
difference of squares, something like m plus d times m minus d, 

582
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:15,555
but that distance is an imaginary value, i, what you get is m squared minus 

583
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:17,360
i times d squared.

584
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,280
But because i squared is by definition negative one, you get a sum of squares.

585
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,515
So even sums of squares, which come up in geometry, 

586
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:29,372
Pythagorean theorem stuff, all of that, can be expressed as 

587
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:32,800
a kind of difference of squares, which itself gives a kind of factoring.

588
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,460
And this, this shows up in a lot of very, very beautiful math later down the road.

589
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,460
One of my favorite videos that I've made actually is, oh, what did I title it?

590
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,410
I think pi hiding in prime regularities, where 

591
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,140
you're counting lattice points inside a circle.

592
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,870
And the key insight associated with doing that is to realize that asking when 

593
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,887
you can express something as the sum of two squares is a sort of factoring problem, 

594
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:59,095
but it's factoring not where you're dealing with prime numbers on the real number line, 

595
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:02,300
but primes in complex numbers, these things called Gaussian primes.

596
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,470
So even simple, I shouldn't say simple stuff, but even stuff that comes up 

597
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,708
in high school, like the quadratic formula, I think if you're learning it the right way, 

598
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,660
it ends up connecting to all sorts of other delightful things.

599
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,640
And remembering these patterns comes up, like I said.

600
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,220
So just to re-emphasize, how did we get here?

601
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,570
What three key facts do you need to be aware of with quadratics to 

602
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,960
be able to kind of rediscover a kind of quadratic formula on the fly?

603
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,460
The first one is how to read the coefficient sitting in front of x.

604
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,218
And if we have a quadratic that looks like x squared plus b prime x plus c prime, 

605
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:39,700
you can read that first coefficient as the negative sum of the roots.

606
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,920
You don't know that already, you can rediscover it on the fly, 

607
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,680
but that is actually worth coming away with.

608
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,120
Similar with how you can read the other coefficient, it's the product of the roots.

609
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,527
Then the only other thing you need to know is that we could 

610
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:54,614
express that product of roots as a difference of squares with 

611
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:58,100
respect to the mean and the kind of standard deviation of those roots.

612
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,640
And you can just solve any quadratic that comes to you on the fly.

613
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,422
The only thing that looks remotely like memorization is if you want 

614
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:09,080
to jumpstart to the end and just say m plus or minus m squared minus p.

615
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,773
Now to finish things off, I think it would be very satisfying 

616
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:15,418
to remind ourselves that this is actually equivalent to the 

617
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,239
traditional quadratic formula, something that looks much bigger.

618
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,500
So let's go ahead and actually do that exercise.

619
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,300
And again, if you can, pause and just work it out for yourself right now.

620
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960
So let's remind ourselves of how that goes.

621
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,080
So we've got, what are we solving?

622
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,659
Any kind of quadratic.

623
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,460
Ax squared plus bx plus c.

624
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,891
We want to say no matter what a, b, and c are, 

625
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:43,219
give me a systematic way to find these roots.

626
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,080
Again, maybe you're doing something beautiful like ray tracing.

627
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,300
Let me pull up that image again.

628
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,300
That was a really nice image.

629
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,139
I just can't believe that this is something that a computer generated.

630
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,380
I guess I should believe it because like Pixar movies are amazing.

631
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,063
But evidently, if you know the kind of math that can lead you to create an image 

632
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:05,400
like this one, that's the kind of thing that can get your job as an engineer at Pixar.

633
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,980
And of course, what is that math?

634
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,820
That math is exactly what we're doing right now.

635
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,740
So let's work it out again.

636
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,140
Ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero.

637
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,740
This time, we're just going to write everything in terms of a, b, and c.

638
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,120
No new variables coming up.

639
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,692
So when we do the first step of rescaling, we say x squared 

640
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:29,580
is equal to b divided by a times x plus c divided by a.

641
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,940
We don't give it any new names.

642
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,580
Now remember how our trick works.

643
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,140
We sort of picture in our head, hey, imagine this quadratic has some roots.

644
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,000
Let's call them r and s.

645
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,320
And we're trying to find the midpoint and the standard deviation.

646
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,920
And we can read off that that midpoint is the negative of the second term divided by two.

647
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,560
So in this case, that's going to be negative b over 2a.

648
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,620
Great.

649
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:05,291
And then that standard deviation is going to be m squared minus the product of the roots, 

650
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:11,060
which in this case looks like negative b over 2a squared minus, 

651
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:17,640
and the product here is what that last term is, c divided by a, c over a.

652
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,212
And remember, if you don't remember this idea that, oh, 

653
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,500
that's what the distance is, just re-derive it for yourself on the fly.

654
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,945
Just go and say, okay, I remember that the product p is just the product of my two roots, 

655
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:34,240
which can be expressed as m minus d, m plus d.

656
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, okay, that's something I can write as m squared minus d squared.

657
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,340
Oh, okay, that's what gives me an expression for d squared in terms of m squared and p.

658
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,980
Don't feel like you have to just come in and know it off the top of your head.

659
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,600
But after you do it a couple times, it sticks in your memory.

660
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,280
So that's m, that's d, and the quadratic formula is just telling us that the 

661
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,088
roots are m plus and minus, that's standard deviation, which in this case looks like, 

662
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:08,289
maybe I'll write it out on two lines because this will be a lot, negative b, 

663
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:13,625
actually no, I'll write it on one line for this one, negative b plus or minus, 

664
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:19,028
I'm jumping to the original quadratic formula, a little bit too hard ingrained, 

665
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,675
we'll go back to two lines, negative b divided by 2a, 

666
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:28,011
divided by 2a plus or minus the square root, oh, I wrote this incorrectly, oh, 

667
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,240
someone should have corrected me.

668
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,903
This is what d squared is equal to, d squared is this whole thing, 

669
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,580
so d itself is the root of those.

670
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,530
I'm sure lots of people were shouting that in the live chat, 

671
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,800
I don't have it pulled up now, but to those of you who did, much appreciated.

672
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,060
So what do we have here?

673
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Well, it's going to be the square of negative b over 2a minus c over a, minus c over a.

674
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,641
Okay, now we just got to expand this thing, which is frankly not super fun, 

675
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:06,980
but it'll connect it to the original quadratic formula to for us.

676
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,444
So I can pull out this 2a squared, and I'm just going to write that as 1 over 

677
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:18,414
4a times negative b squared, negative b, yeah, negative b squared, 

678
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:23,902
and then I want to also pull out 1 over 4a, I want to be able to say that 

679
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:28,130
the last term also looks like 1 over 4a times something, 

680
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:34,063
and that something to make it equal to c over a would have to cancel out the 4, 

681
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:38,439
it would have to cancel out an extra a, and then c, sorry, 

682
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,480
because this is really 1 over 4a squared.

683
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
Let's see, have I done this right?

684
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,311
Yeah, because I pulled out the 2a, so that should be 4 times a squared, 

685
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:49,080
so over here I have 4 times a squared.

686
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,140
I want that to cancel to become c over a, which it looks like it does, so that's awesome.

687
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,785
So you can go over here, negative b over 2a, plus or minus, 

688
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:01,840
and if this feels tedious, that's kind of the point.

689
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,741
The whole quadratic formula is more complicated than it needs to be, 

690
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:08,059
because we were just solving any quadratic that was thrown at us without having 

691
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,502
to do this, but this is what happens if you don't introduce any new variable names 

692
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:12,000
on your way.

693
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,520
It's like code that hasn't been refactored properly.

694
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,440
Okay, so what can we do here?

695
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,022
We can factor out the 1 over 4a squared, and because that's in a radical, 

696
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:28,262
its square root will also be 1 over 2a, and then what sits inside is what remains, 

697
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:31,720
the well familiar negative b squared minus 4a.

698
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,776
Okay, and this this is starting to look like the traditional form, 

699
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:40,680
because if we pull onto the numerator, negative b plus or minus square root of...

700
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,920
why am I writing negative b squared?

701
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,920
Yeah, so this is a negative b squared, same as positive b squared.

702
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,960
What should sit on the inside here is b squared minus 4ac.

703
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,740
You can see how scatterbrained I am when I'm just doing some arithmetic at times.

704
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,680
It's okay.

705
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,580
We all forget a variable or two here and there, 

706
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,331
but maybe that's why I actually care so much about formulas having nice 

707
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:12,020
readable meanings, because I think this is a very error-prone process for someone like me.

708
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,568
If I'm just trying to work through with a bunch of symbols that I don't 

709
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:18,526
necessarily know how to read them, I get to the end result, 

710
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:22,420
and it's hard for me to say like, oh yeah, of course that's what the answer is.

711
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,470
Whereas if I look at something like the simpler variant of the quadratic formula, 

712
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,404
if I basically refactor it and I'm saying, okay, 

713
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,920
does the midpoint equal negative b over 2?

714
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,125
I can kind of fact check, yeah, that that makes sense, 

715
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,740
especially if you know a little calculus.

716
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,884
Those of you will be able to look at that quadratic formula 

717
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:42,820
and understand how to find the maximal or minimal point.

718
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,093
So that's a thing that gets reinforced with a better pattern later on in 

719
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:49,460
your mathematical life, always a good sign that you're learning things well.

720
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,040
I can ask myself if it makes sense that the distance looks like this.

721
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,400
Again, that has a readable meaning.

722
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,314
So when I'm looking at the simpler version of the quadratic formula, 

723
00:40:59,314 --> 00:41:02,632
we have m plus or minus a kind of square root of the variance, 

724
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:04,160
a kind of standard deviation.

725
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,340
So it's a refactoring.

726
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,232
Now I titled this thing, this is the simpler version of the quadratic formula, 

727
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:12,080
and I think someone could rightfully complain.

728
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,300
Like, is this actually simpler?

729
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,420
Because, you know, you've got a lot of steps, you've introduced new variables into it.

730
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,602
Now, in addition to thinking of the three coefficients a, b, and c, 

731
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:25,114
you're telling me I also have to think about like a new term m and a distance 

732
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:25,700
between them.

733
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,991
But for me, math is very much about trying to draw connections to other patterns, 

734
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:32,972
and I think things are much better remembered if you have that web of 

735
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:35,400
connections in your head rather than just isolated cases.

736
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,338
And the whole lesson here, if we think about what's going on, 

737
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:43,040
it's about representing the same information in different ways, right?

738
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,070
Because what the quadratic formula is doing for us, it's saying, 

739
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:54,580
can I go from my coefficients a, b, and c, and can I get to the roots r and s?

740
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,177
And we know that there's a very easy way to go the other way around, 

741
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:02,640
because we can expand something like x minus r and x minus s.

742
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,032
And really, because that a can get scaled out, 

743
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:10,122
it doesn't add any information to the system, there's really as much information 

744
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:11,940
as two different constants in there.

745
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,980
So one of these directions is easy, and one of these directions is hard.

746
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,894
And this idea of information that can be expressed in separate ways and translation 

747
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:25,400
one direction being easy, one direction hard, that comes up all the time in math.

748
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,920
That's a very useful thing to think about.

749
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,491
And another useful thing to think about is how sometimes going in that 

750
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:34,000
harder direction will be better if you go through some intermediate step.

751
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,349
In this case, rather than thinking of your pair of numbers on the 

752
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:42,519
number line just as they are, doing your m plus or minus d trick, 

753
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:46,500
because we know that that changes how you think about products.

754
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,570
If you go through the intermediate step of expressing that same information 

755
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,980
with a mean and a standard deviation, that can get you to the roots.

756
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,884
And that's all this is, it's just talking about different information flow paths that 

757
00:42:58,884 --> 00:43:02,045
can help go between various ways to just express two numbers, 

758
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:05,409
whether those two numbers are the coefficients of your quadratic, 

759
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:08,672
so if the lesson you come away with is one of thinking, oh wow, 

760
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:12,343
sometimes there's a lot of different ways that I can represent my data, 

761
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:16,829
and some of them lend themselves to certain kind of problem solving better than others, 

762
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,500
well then that is the proper lesson to have with the quadratic equation.

763
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,060
Okay, so I think with that I'm going to call it an end to lesson number one.

764
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,040
Really want to thank everyone who showed up for this, definitely a ton of fun.

765
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,417
Next time we're going to have the live quizzing dynamic where we're 

766
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:35,580
going to get stats up on the screen, so it's going to be pretty cool.

767
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,939
I think this is a very cool thing that two former co-workers of mine 

768
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:42,238
put together from Khan Academy, but obviously this is the first time 

769
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:45,107
that we're trying it, it's a little rough around the edges, 

770
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:48,980
so in the end what it's going to look like is these bars that you're seeing live.

771
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,160
Oh interesting, these are bigger numbers than they were before.

772
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,660
Okay, clearly they're updating, they're updating.

773
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,900
Oh this is exciting.

774
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,240
Do I have actual access here?

775
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh it would be so fun to do this properly before we end.

776
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,880
Oh my god, oh this is so great, I think we can do it.

777
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,240
Okay, are you ready for this guys?

778
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Okay, I'm grading the answers.

779
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,580
Oh, oh wonderful, oh we can see what people answered.

780
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,340
This is great, this is how I wanted to end the stream.

781
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,980
While I was talking just in the background some magic was being done, this is wonderful.

782
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,660
So it looks like the most common answer, what's our question here?

783
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,120
What best describes your relationship with the quadratic formula?

784
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,340
And the most common answer is C.

785
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,840
I'm a big fan, you might say I'm rooting for it.

786
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:38,700
So it looks like 1724 of you, five short of Ramanujan's constant, are addicted to puns.

787
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,720
Let's do a couple more, this is going to be pretty fun.

788
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,623
These were just like the joke warm-up questions before we got into the real lesson, 

789
00:44:50,623 --> 00:44:53,842
but I actually think this is the perfect way to end the whole lesson, 

790
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:57,660
is to just kind of wind down with some of what were meant to be introductory jokes.

791
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,580
Oh it's working, I love this so much.

792
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:08,380
Oh and there's if the quadratic formula had a patronus, what would it be?

793
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:17,080
Okay well it looks like around 800 of you think it will be something.

794
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,725
By the way, I'm being told right now that if there's too many of you who access it, 

795
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:26,597
we're for sure going to break the system, and I'm purposefully ignoring that 

796
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:30,320
because I'm having fun with this and if it breaks that kind of tickles me.

797
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,895
So I'm being told not to say this, but please go to 3b1b.co live and enter 

798
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:38,882
questions to this, and then you know whenever things break that would be 

799
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:42,760
a perfect time to end the stream because I just think that's hilarious.

800
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,780
Okay so oh again 1791, oh I guess we blew past Ramanujan's constant.

801
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,991
Maybe I can try to see if I can grade this at a point right where we're 

802
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:56,800
going to lock in answers where the majority is 1729, I think that would be fun.

803
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,260
Okay so it looks like a majority of people went with C.

804
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,270
If the quadratic formula had a patronus, it would be an old man 

805
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,860
hunched over a chessboard, which is the correct answer actually.

806
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,312
You know this question was structured as a poll where there's 

807
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,540
no correct or incorrect rating, but I don't think that's right.

808
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,751
I think it should have been structured where C is the 

809
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:21,020
objectively correct JK Rowling would agree style answer.

810
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,160
All right let's do the the warm-up question number three here.

811
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,340
Oh this is a fun one.

812
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,000
Okay what does it say?

813
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,780
What integer will most people enter into this box?

814
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,140
Okay oh oh lots of answers coming in.

815
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,580
Again I really want my friends to like struggle, I have bars all over my face.

816
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,108
You know this actually seems apropos given that the whole title of this is locked 

817
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:49,687
down math that it starts to look like I'm slowly being imprisoned by everyone's 

818
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:53,580
answers and just getting locked down further and further into the quarantine situation.

819
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:00,007
So this one actually now there is an objectively correct answer because 

820
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:05,462
there is going to be some number that most people enter and it looks like 

821
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:11,360
919 of you think that it'll be one particular thing, but we've got a widespread.

822
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,140
This is actually pretty fun.

823
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,500
So again if you want to partake in this head on over to 3b1.co.live.

824
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,680
I actually think the best way that you could do this.

825
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,040
Oh what is the seven?

826
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,134
Wow I would not have guessed that most people entered seven 

827
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:31,905
and in a weird way like the plurality of you are definitionally 

828
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:35,440
correct that seven was the most commonly entered expression.

829
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,020
69 being the second most common.

830
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,220
I can make a guess for why that might be the case.

831
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,031
Did you know that 69 is the first number where if you square 

832
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:47,926
it and then you cube it those two values between them encounter 

833
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:51,760
the numbers or the digits zero through nine once and only once.

834
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,130
Yeah it's the first number with that property which I 

835
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,900
assume is why that was the second most popular answer.

836
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,728
But the very end which is actually apropos at this point we can pull 

837
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:06,467
up another question which is going to be what I was going to open 

838
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:10,320
the whole lesson with so you can kind of see how the plan went here.

839
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,977
How many times do you expect to use the quadratic 

840
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,880
formula in your real life outside of school?

841
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,466
And in this case luckily I'm getting a little bit less you know locked down by the bars 

842
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:26,644
trapping me in here because it seems like there's a little bit more consensus around 

843
00:48:26,644 --> 00:48:31,020
how many times people think they will need to use the quadratic formula in the real life.

844
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,708
What I could do is a plot twist on this and say you know interpret this question 

845
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:41,202
in light of the lesson rather than when will you literally use negative b plus 

846
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:45,639
or minus square root of I always forget it square root of b squared minus 4ac 

847
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:50,418
over 2a that whole thing to when are you going to use the principles of recognizing 

848
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:54,742
that a product of numbers expressed as a difference of squares can help you 

849
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:59,179
solve problems or when are you going to use the principles of expressing your 

850
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:03,560
data in terms of a mean and a standard deviation can help you solve problems.

851
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,750
That I think would give you wildly different answers but at the moment 

852
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,969
we've got a lot of you on the system and it's not breaking and I'm 

853
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:14,140
so happy right now I just can't tell you how much this tickles me.

854
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,810
So it looks like we've got a wide forming consensus you know for for my sake can we 

855
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,385
can we just like keep going on this I would love to see if we can get that top bar 

856
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:29,015
up to 1729 whatever it might be at the moment we can all guess what it might be but 

857
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:33,645
let's see if you can go to 3b1b.co slash live wherever you're watching this I think 

858
00:49:33,645 --> 00:49:38,110
honestly the best dynamic that I could imagine is if you just pull up your phone 

859
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:42,630
and you're watching this on a screen with the one hand and then you're using your 

860
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,205
phone to to answer questions a lot of you are already watching it on your phone so 

861
00:49:47,205 --> 00:49:51,780
that wouldn't necessarily work but that is the dynamic I would I would most expect.

862
00:49:53,080 --> 00:51:03,526
Okay so I'm just going to wait until we get that 

863
00:51:03,526 --> 00:52:09,660
top bar up to be Ramanujan's constant of 1729.
