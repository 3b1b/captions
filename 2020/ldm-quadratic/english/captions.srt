00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello and welcome to the very first episode of Lockdown Math.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,880
So in this first lecture, what I'm going to talk with you guys about is the

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,840
quadratic formula. And traditionally, I think the quadratic

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,000
formula is one of the most famously memorized things in high school. We almost

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,160
all kind of have this song that sings in our head

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
related to it. And yet, if you actually ask someone,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,280
how often do you expect you're going to be using this in the real world?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,080
I mean, how many people are going to give an answer that's greater than zero to

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,440
that question? Now what I want to do is give you guys a

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,720
lesson regarding the quadratic formula that's a little bit different from the

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,920
traditional approach. And the main thing I want to focus on is

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,800
connecting it to other common patterns in math

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,560
that are useful for general problem solving. Now the tactic that I'm going to

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,520
talk through, it's not the usual completing the squares bit that some

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
people will learn in high school. And when you learn that, you often think,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,440
okay, in principle, I could re-derive the quadratic formula,

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
but frankly, it's going to be a bit of a pain. What I will talk about is somewhat

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,800
similar to something that Po-Shen Lo put out a

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
couple months ago. For those of you who don't know him, he

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
has a YouTube channel, but more than that, he's the coach of the USIMO team,

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,720
and he has a company called X-Pi, does a lot of great math stuff.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
So he talked about kind of an alternate way that we could teach the quadratic

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,160
formula. The way I'm going to talk about it is a

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,360
little bit different from how he did, but certainly very similar in spirit.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,880
Again, the upshot that I want you guys to come away with is the fact that

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
you should connect this to other common patterns in math so as to make yourself

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,360
a better problem solver. And that should be the main takeaway

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,360
lesson for, you know, this particular topic. Now,

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
these lectures in general, I'm going to be shooting for something

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
roughly on the order of an hour for each one of them, and the dynamic that I'm

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
going for is one where there's questions that I'm asking the

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,800
audience, and then the audience interacts with it in a very, well, in a

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,520
very live way. Now, the thing about live stuff, though,

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
is sometimes it doesn't go the way that you intended.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
So the general technology that we're going to have for this is going to

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,080
involve me pulling up some kind of question, like,

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,360
for example, right here, the question is asking kind of

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,280
facetiously about your relationship with the quadratic formula,

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
and I even had this going over the intro animation for you guys.

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,080
And then what you see is the statistics associated with what the

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
answers, you know, other people are entering are,

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,880
and they'll kind of get overlaid. We see the bars. At the moment, all you see are

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,440
question marks. We don't know what the most common answer was,

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,880
but at some point I can choose to grade that, and then we'll see.

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,840
Except for the fact that it looks like there's quite a few of you guys, and it

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
is giving our servers a little bit of trouble.

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
So we have a couple people who are going to be working on that in the

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,680
background. In the meantime, I'll just be asking the

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
questions that are pushing us through the lesson.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,320
For future streams, this will hopefully be a much more dynamic situation where

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,920
as you answer, we're kind of grading it and you see how it's going.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,280
For this particular one, who knows? Some magic might happen halfway through.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
But there's a lot of excitement among you guys right now, which is awesome,

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
and I love that. And let's see if we can translate that into some of the math

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
itself. So one of the questions that I was going

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,080
to ask is, how many times do you expect to use

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,600
the quadratic formula? And when we were doing this a little bit

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,040
earlier with a couple people, for sure the most common answer was

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,160
zero. Zero times is when I think I'll use the quadratic formula

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,360
outside of school. And a funny story about that, I actually

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
was once giving this talk at Pixar where I brought it up as this example of

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,320
something that we teach every student, and it's unclear why.

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,080
They're not going to use it. And I should have known better than to say this to a

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
bunch of engineers at Pixar, because one of them looked at me and he

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,960
was like, oh, I'll have you know, I actually use the quadratic formula all

66
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,800
the time. His name was Tim Babb, and he very kindly

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,160
sent over basically a storyboard for a video, something I think he was pitching

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,120
me on. And the basic idea, he was talking

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,640
through an image that he created purely with computer graphics. I think

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
this is totally beautiful. You would think that this is a photograph

71
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,560
of some reflective billiard balls, but this is entirely computer graphics.

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,880
And the tactics used behind this involve something called ray tracing.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,880
So the basic idea there is you sort of imagine

74
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,480
a camera shooting out a bunch of rays through each pixel

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
of your screen, and then depending on whether it hits the sphere and how it

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
hits the sphere, that tells you how to color each pixel.

77
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,480
Now part of that problem though is to know, hey, if I'm shooting a ray

78
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,680
in some direction, will it hit a given sphere?

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,840
And so what you might do is define a certain vector, you might imagine an

80
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,560
amount of time that the beam of light is moving,

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
and then you can come up with a graph for how close

82
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,560
is that ray to the sphere as a function of time. And in some cases, if it passes

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
through the sphere, you're going to have two solutions there.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
And once you work out the math, it turns out this is a quadratic equation,

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,080
so what you need is a systematic way to plug in these solutions

86
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
to a quadratic equation, and it needs to be programmatic, it needs to be some

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
kind of formula because you're doing this for every single pixel on the

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
screen. You also need to be able to know is it

89
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
just glancing off of the sphere, or does it not go through it at all?

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
And again, all of that comes down to solving a quadratic.

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,960
And this particular engineer at Pixar, he did a loose back of the envelope

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
calculation for me that suggested the movie Coco probably

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,640
used the quadratic formula over a trillion times, just given how

94
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,520
many lights there are for every single frame in that shot.

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
So in some very real sense, the quadratic formula is useful

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,640
to the point of being used a trillion times to produce a movie.

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,840
Nevertheless, I don't necessarily think that's representative of

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,520
most people's future, and it could be the case that the reason we teach people

99
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,480
this formula is because maybe they happen to be that Pixar

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,720
employee. You never know what's going to be useful.

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,000
But I want to make the case again that we can connect it to other patterns and

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,200
problem solving bits in math. And the way that I'm going to go about

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,480
this is to start in a place that's frankly

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,760
completely unrelated to quadratics and quadratic functions.

105
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,800
I just want to talk about some mental math tricks, okay?

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,840
Because I think if you are thinking about arithmetic, something

107
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
very basic, something we do in elementary school, and you think about it

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
deeply enough, some of the patterns that you observe

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,320
become relevant to stuff that you're doing later on.

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,160
So for example, let's say I ask you to factor the number 35.

111
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,000
You know, it's easy to see that five goes into it, and

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,440
it goes into it seven times, each of those is prime, great.

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,600
We know how to factor 35. Now factoring is kind of an annoying task, the bigger

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
the numbers get, especially if there's no obvious small

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,240
factors that go into it. Because if I asked you, hey let's factor 143,

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
I mean how do you go about it? I think the way a lot of us think about it is we

117
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
initially think, okay, we know that two doesn't go into it

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,320
because it's not even. Three, there's a nice divisibility check

119
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,120
where you do one plus four plus three, and that sum in this case is five plus

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,200
three or eight is not divisible by three, so

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,400
that's out. Five we can see doesn't go into it.

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,320
Seven, okay you have to think about that for a moment, but you might see that seven

123
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,600
goes into 140 evenly because that's 20 times seven,

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,560
okay, so that's right out. And at this point you might be annoyed

125
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
with whoever was asking you the question, but if you go one step further you might

126
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
see, okay, 11. Actually 11 does go into it, and it ends

127
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,040
up being 11 times 13. I just love the fact that

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,200
right now people probably have no idea what any

129
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,760
of this has to do with the quadratic formula, but I assure you,

130
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,840
highly related. Because what if I asked you

131
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,360
3,599? And this particular example isn't

132
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
randomly chosen by the way. I was reading this article about a Russian

133
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
programmer in an interview that he had, I think it

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
was at Goldman Sachs, and he was describing kind of the intensity of that

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
interview environment. And in one of them he just walks in the

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
door, hadn't even met the person, and the person just shouts at him,

137
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,320
factor 3,599. You know the programmer's like, uh, all right. And he

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,240
actually was able to spit out the factors

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
particularly quickly, which is impressive given the fact that if we imagine going

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,200
through all of the different primes, you know, does two go into it? No. Does three

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,040
go into it? No. Five? No. You're going to be sitting there for quite a while.

142
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,760
So clearly something different was happening in his head, and the question

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,960
is, what? Well one thing you might notice

144
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,720
about the numbers that I've chosen here is that 35 is awfully close to a square.

145
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
It's actually just one less than six squared. And maybe it kind of makes

146
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
sense that its factors are each kind of close

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,600
to six. You know, five times seven, it's probably not going to equal six

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,120
times six, but the fact that they're of similar sizes should be intuitive,

149
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,440
and as it happens it's precisely one less. And something similar happens with

150
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,560
the other example I chose. 143 is rather close to a square number,

151
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
144. In fact it's one less. And it's no coincidence that its two

152
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,400
factors are hovering right around the square root of that value.

153
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,800
One of them is 12 minus 1, and the other one is 12 plus 1.

154
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,680
So it kind of makes sense that the product will be something around 12 times

155
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
12. And so from this you might make a guess

156
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,400
that hey, maybe any time that you have some number that's one

157
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,800
less than a perfect square, and this, you know, it's suspiciously close to a

158
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,400
very round seeming number, 3600. Well what is 3600?

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,320
We recognize the 36 as being six squared and 100 is 10 squared,

160
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,960
so that's 60 times 60. And maybe you think, okay, the guess,

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,640
if it's going to follow the same pattern as what we've seen above,

162
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,080
is that this would be one less than 60 times one more than 60.

163
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,240
But of course you don't just want a pattern match, let's see if there's a

164
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
nice reason that it's a true. You can work it out algebraically, which

165
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
we will, but as you guys know I love animation, so let's just see if there's a

166
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
nice visual way to understand this particular property.

167
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
And if we're going to think about this, the natural place to turn is to think

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
about squares. So let me just pull up an image of a

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
square, and if we want to say can I factor

170
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,920
a number which is one less than a square, what I might have us imagine doing

171
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
is taking the corner off of that square, okay?

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
So let's say it's x by x, whatever x is, in this case it happens to be six, but

173
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
you want to think a little bit more abstractly than that.

174
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,720
And I'm going to take that bottom right corner, get it out of here, we don't want

175
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
it. The question of factoring is to say can

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
I rearrange the quantity that remains into some kind of rectangle? And in this

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
case if I take that bottom row, sloop it on up to the right, what you can

178
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
see is it forms a rectangle, one with a side length x plus one and

179
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,600
another with a side length x minus one. So this general property holds quite

180
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,520
well, and I think that's really cool, right? You see this visually, you see that

181
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,040
it's this neat mental arithmetic trick where any time you have some sort of

182
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,840
square number minus one, you can factor that as x plus one

183
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,080
times x minus one. But of course we can go one step further

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,920
than that if we really want to. It doesn't have to be one sitting there.

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
If we go back to our diagram, what you might instead do is say, hey,

186
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
what if I chopped off a bigger corner of that square? What if I wasn't taking x

187
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,840
squared minus one, I was taking x squared minus y squared?

188
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, I can rearrange what remains into a rectangle where it's x plus y

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
on one side and then x minus y on the other side.

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Now that's the geometric way that you can view it, which I think gives a

191
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,080
certain satisfaction, and when we view it in terms of

192
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,800
numbers it gives us a reminder of how powerful it is.

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
And yet somehow when we do this algebraically, the magic

194
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,480
is a little bit lost. It's definitely easier to see, and that demonstrates the

195
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,800
power of algebra, but if I just said x plus y times x minus

196
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,480
y... Actually, you know what, let me change the variable names there. I don't like x

197
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,960
and y because those don't necessarily have the same meaning.

198
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,120
What I might do is try to picture, you know, let's picture the original two

199
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,720
numbers that we had, something that's like 59 and 61

200
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,840
on a number line, and I want to think in terms of the midpoint

201
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,640
m and then the distance between m and each of the other numbers,

202
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,040
so plus and minus d. In this case d is just one, but in principle it might be

203
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,680
something more. So if I ask you multiply m minus d

204
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
times m plus d, you know, at this point it's pretty straightforward algebra.

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
The first term's m times m, we get m squared.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Next we have negative d times m, so that's minus d

207
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,880
m. Next we have m times plus d, m times plus d, and then negative d times

208
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,200
d, so minus d squared. And indeed what comes out is m squared

209
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,240
minus d squared. And if you're anything like me, the first

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
time you see this in an algebra class, it's just one of a whole bunch of

211
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,240
exercises that you're doing. You're like, yeah, okay, I can expand this one way, I

212
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
guess some terms cancel out nicely. But the more you think about this, the

213
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
more intriguing it is, because any two numbers we can express,

214
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,080
you know, if I just take any numbers r and s, I could write that down as some

215
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,600
midpoint plus or minus a distance, and what this

216
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
is telling us is to think about products is always the same as thinking about a

217
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
difference of squares, which is weird, because products can be

218
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
very chaotic. If I just walk through the number line,

219
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,400
and I don't know, I say look at 101, 102, 103, and I just say take a look at all

220
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,000
the numbers on the number line, and I want you to systematically tell me

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,760
can each one of them be broken down as a product of two smaller whole

222
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,200
numbers? Well, we know that what that's asking is

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,680
what are the primes, because only the primes can't be broken down like that,

224
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
and yet evidently that's a very similar question to saying when can I walk

225
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,400
through those numbers and say, hey, am I able to express you as a

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,280
difference of squares? Could I add a square number to you to get another

227
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,840
square? That still feels hard, but that feels

228
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,040
like a very different question to me. So I think if you were doing some

229
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,720
arithmetic and you had this in the back of your mind,

230
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,600
that's a good pattern, and that's a pattern that's going to come up later in

231
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
life. For example, let's say later in life you

232
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,720
find yourself wanting to understand quadratic functions.

233
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,240
And so here we're going to talk about the the simpler version of the quadratic

234
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
formula, which is really just refactoring the

235
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,080
original thing, but I hope you see it's much easier to actually solve

236
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,680
a random quadratic that's thrown at you if you're going by

237
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,280
um if you're going by the method that I want to show you right here.

238
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,240
So what's the task? Anytime you have some function that looks

239
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,840
like ax squared plus bx plus c, okay, for any numbers a, b, and c.

240
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,440
So maybe that's something like 3x squared minus 4x plus 5.

241
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
And you want to know when that equals zero,

242
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
what are the two roots? Now this is actually equivalent to

243
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,560
rescaling everything, and I think it's a good common pattern to rescaling, where

244
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm going to divide everything by a. So I just want that first

245
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,200
coefficient to be a one, because that's way easier to work with.

246
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,560
So I'm going to call that x squared plus b prime x

247
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,600
plus c prime, where b prime and c prime are just the rescaled versions there.

248
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
And this is a different function, it is a different quadratic function,

249
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,160
but the roots are going to be the same. And one way that you might see this is

250
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,360
if you just graph them. So let's go over and pull up our best

251
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
friend of Desmos, right. So let's say I have some kind of

252
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
parabola, in this case I've written it so that one of the roots is going to be 2

253
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,320
and the other is 4, and then g of x here is just the scaled version of

254
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,520
the expanded version of that. It's exactly the same graph,

255
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,120
but let's say I wanted to scale that up and down, right. So I might take this

256
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,200
and then I will multiply it by some kind of constant.

257
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,920
What do you guys want to call that constant? See this is the thing, if I had

258
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
the question framework working right now, I could just ask you what do you want the

259
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,800
constant to be, and we would see the statistics come up

260
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,680
with what people had. But instead maybe I'll throw in a slider.

261
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,200
And as I change that, the function changes, it is a different function,

262
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,240
but the roots are still 2 and 4, okay. So solving for this rescaled version of

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
the quadratic is the same, and that should kind of make sense,

264
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,040
because s times 0 is always going to be 0, so it doesn't matter how much we

265
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,480
scale it. So going back to what we're working

266
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,080
with here, the reason that I think it's much nicer to make sure that that

267
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,520
leading coefficient is a 1, is because if we're thinking of

268
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,200
our quadratic in terms of its roots, and I say okay, you know it's going to

269
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,520
intersect the x-axis at r and s, or maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but

270
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,960
let's just write one that does like this. Another way that I could express that

271
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,160
particular quadratic is as x minus r

272
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,000
times x minus s, because if I plug in r it's clear that we're going to get 0,

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,760
and if I plug in s, again this term will also cancel out to 0.

274
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,920
So if I expand this, whatever r and s are, they're the unknowns,

275
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,440
I should get the same thing as what we have up here. And this is generally

276
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
useful, this is not just for the quadratic formula, but a very good

277
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,920
relationship to have with polynomials is to know how the roots

278
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,040
correspond to the coefficients, especially in a circumstance where that

279
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
leading coefficient is 1, and the whole polynomial has been kind of

280
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,600
normalized in that way. And in this case if you just expand it

281
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,000
out, what we'll get is x squared minus r plus s

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
times x, because we have this minus r times x,

283
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,760
and then x times minus s, and then the constant term will be negative r times

284
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,560
negative s, so that becomes a positive r times s.

285
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,400
Okay, so what does this tell us? This tells us the first two

286
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,600
of the three key facts that are needed to be able to solve

287
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
any quadratic without really needing to memorize all that much.

288
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,000
So the first key fact is that this b value, I'll call it b prime just to

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
remind ourselves that it's after you've scaled things down,

290
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,000
is the same as the negative sum of the two roots.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,320
Okay, and then similarly c prime is going to be the product of those two

292
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
roots, which is kind of cool because what we

293
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,200
have right here is, you know, it's a system

294
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
that feels like it should have a solution. We have two

295
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
equations and two unknowns, but it's not obvious how we would go about solving it.

296
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,040
And every now and then I think classes will have a unit in factoring

297
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,280
quadratics where they basically tell you to just

298
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
guess and check, so in some very fortunate circumstances if you have

299
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,560
something like, you know, x squared, let's see, minus 7x

300
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,160
plus 12. They basically say see if you can guess

301
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,280
and find two different numbers that add up to be

302
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,400
7 and that multiply to be 12. And if you

303
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
just kind of sit back there and think you're like, okay, can I find any two

304
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,920
numbers that add to 7 and multiply to 12? Well, factoring 12 we get 3 and 4,

305
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,360
and 3 and 4 do add to 7, so yeah, in that case you just

306
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,800
totally luck out and you could write this as

307
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,720
x minus 3 and x minus 4 because those are the two roots.

308
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
And then you typically move on from that chapter and it's like, well in most cases

309
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,920
you won't be able to just guess and check.

310
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,960
And in any case what you're going to look for is a general formula anyway, so

311
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,400
hope you had fun with that. But it turns out there's actually a

312
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,480
systematic way to take this puzzle of finding two numbers

313
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
that have a known sum and a known product

314
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,320
and figure out what they are. And the key comes down to thinking in terms of

315
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,480
not the two numbers themselves but the mean of those two numbers

316
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,960
and then the distance between that mean and each one of them.

317
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
And you can see where this is going, this is why we talked about difference of

318
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,840
squares. Because the third key fact to come away

319
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,520
with, or to come into it with I should maybe say,

320
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,560
is that we could re-express that product as m

321
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,400
minus d times m plus d.

322
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,640
And you see where I'm going, right? That means that the product that we know

323
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,400
looks like m squared minus d squared.

324
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,160
So just to give an example here, it's often much more helpful to have

325
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,320
numbers. Let's say that you were given a

326
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,920
quadratic like x squared, I don't know,

327
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,120
let's do six even numbers will make this easier for us,

328
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,400
and then seven. Okay? And you were tasked with knowing when does this equal zero?

329
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
So I haven't told you how to solve it yet but these three key facts are going

330
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
to be enough to just basically walk yourself into the answer.

331
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
Well, what is what is m, right? Because we're

332
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
going to ultimately express our roots r and s as m plus or minus d

333
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,600
for some kind of midpoint. Well that midpoint

334
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,200
is the sum of the two numbers over two, that's how we define averages. And because

335
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,600
we know the sum of the two numbers is negative b prime, that's the same as

336
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
negative b prime over two, which you can basically read off of the

337
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,640
equation as just negative one half times whatever sitting right

338
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
there, which in this case will be negative three.

339
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,000
Awesome, we know what m is. But look at the equation we have up here.

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,760
We have an expression for c, the last coefficient, in terms of m,

341
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,160
which we now know, and d, which is the only thing we don't know left.

342
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,280
So we could rearrange this, and so that was saying c prime is that,

343
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,360
we could say that d squared, the square of this kind of standard deviation

344
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,160
between our roots, is m squared minus c prime,

345
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,760
the product of the two roots. But we know both of those values, we could just write

346
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,800
that down over here. Maybe I'll change colors again, be a little

347
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,240
flamboyant. d squared is equal to m squared, which in our

348
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,080
example turns out to be nine, minus c prime, which is that last

349
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,440
coefficient, or seven.

350
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,400
Seven. Handwriting is terrible, but I think you guys can work with me. You see

351
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,120
why I usually animate stuff. So that means that's two. So look, when we

352
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,080
said r and s is some midpoint plus or minus a distance,

353
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,280
that midpoint is negative three plus or minus,

354
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,080
well if d squared is two, that means d is the square root of two.

355
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,760
There you go. You could do that for any quadratic that I give you. You could

356
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,800
just walk through that particular process.

357
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,680
And let me just show you what it looks like in general, so that you can maybe

358
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,400
remember it as a formula if you wanted to. In general, for any

359
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,280
quadratic, that midpoint is just

360
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,680
the rescaled version of b, if the leading coefficient wasn't already one,

361
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,880
divided by two. And then that distance, well what did we just do? We took the

362
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,560
square root of the midpoint squared

363
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,160
minus the product of the two. And when I'm sort of singing it in my head, I've

364
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,840
been saying like m squared minus p, just because p has a readable meaning. I

365
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,160
think of it as the midpoint squared minus the product.

366
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,680
But of course p in this context is just whatever the last coefficient of our

367
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,880
quadratic was. So over in this example, the product of

368
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,280
the two coefficients was seven. So for me, what I think the simpler

369
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,080
quadratic formula is, if you're going to memorize anything,

370
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,840
is to come away and say it's m plus or minus

371
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,240
the square root of m squared minus p. All you have to do is first find m, which

372
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
is, you know, just a factor times one of the

373
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,160
coefficients you're looking at, and then find p, which is also, if not

374
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,440
already a factor, a coefficient that you're looking at, a

375
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,800
rescaling of one of them. So this to me is way simpler than the

376
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,080
traditional quadratic formula, and if you were to try to sing a song to yourself

377
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,200
for it, the song is almost too short. It's no fun. You're just sitting there like

378
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
m plus or minus square root of m squared minus p.

379
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,040
That's it. No song. No song to be had. So let's do a couple practice problems

380
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,880
because I do think practice will make it easier.

381
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,120
And for future streams, again, it'll ultimately be the case that I'm giving

382
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,280
you these questions, and then you'll be able to go to

383
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,320
3b1b.co.live and answer them. But because there's too many of you, we

384
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
can't have any fun today. This is the equivalent of trying to run

385
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
a class where you have, you know, I don't know, 20 seats sitting out and you're

386
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,880
going to do a normal lecture, and then there's just people banging at

387
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
the doors and trying to cram themselves in and the fire marshal comes in,

388
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,560
and they're like, ah, you got to cut out the class. You can't have this the way

389
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,760
that you hoped for. But it's cool that there's so many of

390
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,440
you here enthusiastic to learn about math.

391
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
So let's just do some examples, okay? That'll kind of highlight

392
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,000
what this process looks like. Let's say we had x squared plus 10x

393
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,800
plus 3. So in this case it's nicely already rescaled for us. That's always

394
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,760
lovely. So I often, I just like to draw the

395
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,800
picture for myself. Whether or not the two roots turn out to be real

396
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,320
or even positive, it's just nice to remind myself what we're looking for.

397
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
We're looking for where the two roots are, and I know

398
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,080
that a different way to think about products is to think about a difference

399
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,280
of squares. So I just kind of think in my head, okay,

400
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,440
I'll be thinking of that in terms of their mean

401
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
and a kind of standard deviation. So I just write down for myself what does

402
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,000
that mean. Well, it's negative b prime over 2.

403
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,880
And if I forget that fact, if I forget that that's what the

404
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,400
the sum of the two roots is, I could always just go through this little

405
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,560
rigmarole again and say, okay, if I systematically wanted it to be

406
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,080
a quadratic with roots r and s, this is what it would look like, this is how it

407
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,800
would expand. So you can re-derive it on the fly, there's not too much

408
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,160
memorization needed. In this context that works out to be

409
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,840
negative 5. And by the way, if I do ever make any

410
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
mistakes, which I'm quite positive I will,

411
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,800
go ahead and throw them in the chat and those will be forwarded to me and

412
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,640
I'll be able to correct myself there. So we know the midpoint,

413
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
and then we just ask ourselves what's the square of the distance,

414
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,640
and based on difference of squares, that'll be that midpoint squared

415
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,280
minus the product, which in this context is negative 5 squared

416
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,200
or 25 minus the product, which is that last coefficient,

417
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:23,520
minus 3. So what are the roots r and s? Well, it's negative 5 plus or minus

418
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,480
the square root of 25 minus 3, or 22. There you go, another quadratic solved.

419
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,360
Ain't no thing. Let's try another.

420
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
Just because I do think it's kind of nice to get a little bit of practice

421
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,880
here. And as I'm going, if you have a piece of paper and pencil,

422
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,240
please follow along. If you can just kind of race ahead and do the same process

423
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,800
before I do it, that's awesome. That is the best kind of

424
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,240
learning experience. If you're watching this in the future, by the way,

425
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,840
as with any video, I highly encourage you to pause and ponder.

426
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,560
I really think that's the best way to learn math if you're looking at some

427
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,880
kind of lecture. In those crucial moments where there's a

428
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,960
question asked, pause, see if you can do it yourself, and then see what the answer

429
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,560
turns out to be. I guarantee you'll learn more effectively that way.

430
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,600
I don't know what should we do. Let's do

431
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,200
maybe 3x squared. I think I wrote one down earlier, didn't I?

432
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,120
Just as kind of a off-handed thing. What did I write?

433
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,320
No, it wasn't there. Oh yeah, it was at the top.

434
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,880
Let's do that one. 3x squared minus 4x plus 5. Why not?

435
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,120
3x squared minus 4x plus 5. All right, so in this case, step one,

436
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,480
we've got to rescale things. That's what gives the coefficients a

437
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,760
nice readable meaning. Minus four-thirds x

438
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,280
plus five-thirds. Great. And now, same process. I'm sort of

439
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,240
thinking in my head of this particular image where I want to know the midpoint

440
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,200
and the distance. So I say that midpoint is negative

441
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
of this second coefficient divided by two, so that will become positive four-thirds,

442
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,640
but then that four divided by two gives us a two.

443
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,040
So that midpoint will be two-thirds, and then the distance squared

444
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,760
is m squared minus the product, which in this case is five-thirds.

445
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,360
Okay, and m squared in this case is, let's see,

446
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,320
two-thirds squared minus five-thirds. All right, so this one, you know, it gets

447
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,280
a little messier. We've got to work out our fractions, but that's not too

448
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,360
bad. Two-thirds squared is going to be four-ninths.

449
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,880
Oh, I'm off screen a little.

450
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,400
And then what is five-thirds in terms of ninths? That's going to be fifteen

451
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,640
ninths, if I'm not wrong. So we end up getting a negative number,

452
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,520
which is always fun. So here we have negative eleven-ninths.

453
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,040
Okay, so what that means is that our final answer, the roots of this

454
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,240
polynomial, r and s, the values that will make the

455
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,080
polynomial zero, are going to be two-thirds plus or minus

456
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,160
the square root of negative eleven over d.

457
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,520
Negative eleven over d. What am I saying? Negative eleven over nine.

458
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,560
Okay, so that's fun. In this case the square root is a negative, so that means

459
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,280
we have complex roots. And there's actually a

460
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,760
very fun way to think about the way that complex roots

461
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,000
play into this difference of squares perspective on the quadratic formula.

462
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,920
Let me actually try it with a simpler example, but it ends up relating to the

463
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,320
Pythagorean theorem, which I think is cool because the whole

464
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,080
purpose of this is to try to connect various patterns in math that come up a

465
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
lot, things that might be useful outside of this particular class

466
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,640
that you're doing. So I actually have written down for

467
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,080
myself an example that will work out with nice numbers here.

468
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,360
I mean nice-ish. x squared minus 6x plus 10. Okay,

469
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,800
so we go through the same rigmarole, we say m, the midpoint,

470
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,240
is going to be negative b prime over 2, so in that case it works out to just be

471
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,920
3, because we take the negative of this term and divide by 2.

472
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:05,120
d squared is going to be m squared, so 3 squared is 9, minus the

473
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,240
product, which in this case is 10. So nicely that's exactly negative 1,

474
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,800
which means that our two roots, and down to the wire on the page that

475
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,200
I've been writing with here, our two roots are 3 plus or minus

476
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,400
i. Okay, so what that means for us is that the actual

477
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,160
parabola here, it doesn't look like something that crosses the x-axis.

478
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,680
Instead it would be something that maybe sits above it, but it does have

479
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,720
imaginary roots. So if we were to look at the input space,

480
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,320
not just in terms of the real number line, but let me draw it out,

481
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,720
let me go back to black. Black will be our complex plane color for this moment.

482
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,760
We'll call this our imaginary axis, where numbers like i and negative i, the

483
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
square root of 1, or maybe I should say square roots of

484
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
1, it's got two of them, you interchange them, it's fine.

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,200
And then we've got just the real numbers, 1, 2,

486
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,240
3, 4. So in this case our two roots live at 3 plus i,

487
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
and 3 minus i. So this, I should be very clear, this is not

488
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,760
an x-axis and a y-axis. This entire plane now is where the

489
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,800
input lives, where x lives. If you were going to graph it, you'd get some kind of

490
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,000
graph that's outside of the paper. And any of you who've

491
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,200
watched the channel Welsh Labs, which if you haven't you absolutely should,

492
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,400
might be bringing to mind right now an absolutely awesome like artificial

493
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,120
reality effect he does where he sort of pulls out that graph.

494
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,080
Highly worth watching, super great moment. But what's interesting about this

495
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,600
is if we look at the magnitude of the roots,

496
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,120
okay, because I could ask you what is the magnitude of that root? And

497
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,680
it's a right triangle that we're looking at, we've switched from algebra to

498
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,040
geometry now, and based on the Pythagorean theorem it'll

499
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,240
be the square root of one of the lengths squared, which is in

500
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,960
this case 3 squared, plus the other length squared, which is 1

501
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,520
squared. So square root of 3 squared plus 1

502
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:08,000
squared, and that ends up being root 10. It is not a coincidence at all

503
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,920
that the magnitude of our roots, I guess sort of, no pun intended, the

504
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,120
magnitude of the roots of our quadratic equation here

505
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,640
are the square root of that constant coefficient. Because remember that

506
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,560
constant coefficient is telling us what is the product of the two roots.

507
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,600
And if you know something about complex numbers, you might know that if I have

508
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,800
two complex numbers and I multiply them together, the

509
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,760
magnitude of the product is the same as the product of the

510
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,600
magnitudes. So in this case, given that I'm going to have two

511
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,440
separate roots who are symmetric, you know, it's going to

512
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,040
be 3 plus or minus some imaginary number, each of them is

513
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,400
going to have the same magnitude. The product of their magnitudes needs to

514
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,840
be 10, we know that off hand, so you kind of know ahead of time that

515
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,560
it should be a magnitude of square root of 10.

516
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,520
And the reason that this is happening is basically because when you do

517
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,360
difference of squares, something like m plus d

518
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:11,840
times m minus d, but that distance is an imaginary value, i,

519
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,960
what you get is m squared minus i times d squared, but because i squared is by

520
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,240
definition negative one, you get a sum of squares.

521
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,080
So even sums of squares which come up in geometry, Pythagorean theorem stuff, all

522
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,160
of that, can be expressed as a kind of

523
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,120
difference of squares, which itself gives a kind of factoring.

524
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,960
And this shows up in a lot of very very beautiful math later down the road.

525
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,320
One of my favorite videos that I've made actually is,

526
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,480
oh what did I title it, I think pi hiding in prime regularities,

527
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,160
where you're counting lattice points inside a circle and the key insight

528
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,600
associated with doing that is to realize that asking when you can

529
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,840
express something as the sum of two squares

530
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,200
is a sort of factoring problem, but it's factoring not where you're dealing with

531
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,080
prime numbers on the real number line, but primes in

532
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,720
complex numbers, these things called Gaussian primes.

533
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,920
So even simple, I shouldn't say simple stuff, but

534
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,200
even stuff that comes up in high school like the quadratic formula,

535
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,480
I think if you're learning it the right way it ends up connecting to all sorts

536
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,000
of other delightful things. And remembering these patterns comes up

537
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,960
like I said. So just to re-emphasize, how did we get

538
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,440
here? What three key facts do you need to be aware of

539
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,520
with quadratics to be able to kind of rediscover a kind of quadratic formula on

540
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,840
the fly? The first one is how to read the

541
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,600
coefficient sitting in front of x. And if we have a quadratic that looks

542
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,760
like x squared plus b prime x plus c prime, you can read that first

543
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,400
coefficient as the negative sum of the roots.

544
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,040
You don't know that already, you can rediscover it on the fly, but that is

545
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,320
actually worth coming away with. Similar with how you can read the other

546
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,480
coefficient, it's the product of the roots.

547
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,160
Then the only other thing you need to know is that we could express that

548
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,120
product of roots as a difference of squares with respect

549
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,560
to the mean and the kind of standard deviation of those roots.

550
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,840
And you can just solve any quadratic that comes to you on the fly.

551
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,680
The only thing that looks remotely like memorization is if you want to jump

552
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,240
start to the end and just say m plus or minus m squared minus p.

553
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,440
Now to finish things off, I think it would be very satisfying to remind

554
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,760
ourselves that this is actually equivalent to the

555
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,880
traditional quadratic formula, something that looks much bigger.

556
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,320
So let's go ahead and actually do that exercise.

557
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,120
And again, if you can, pause and just work it out for yourself right now.

558
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,640
So let's remind ourselves of how that goes.

559
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,120
So we've got, what are we solving? Any kind of quadratic.

560
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,760
ax squared plus bx plus c. We want to say no matter what a, b, and c are, give me a

561
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,880
systematic way to find these roots. Again, maybe you're doing something

562
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,680
beautiful like ray tracing. Let me pull up that image again, that was a really

563
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,800
nice image. I just can't believe that this is

564
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,880
something that a computer generated. I guess I should believe it because

565
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,200
Pixar movies are amazing. But evidently, if you know the kind of

566
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,560
math that can lead you to create an image like this one,

567
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,640
that's the kind of thing that can get you a job as an engineer at Pixar.

568
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,360
And of course, what is that math? That math is exactly what we're doing right

569
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,400
now. So let's work it out again. ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero.

570
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
This time we're just going to write everything in terms of a, b, and c. No new

571
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,880
variables coming up. So when we do the first step of

572
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,160
rescaling, we say x squared is equal to b divided by a

573
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,120
times x plus c divided by a. We don't give it any new names. Now

574
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,040
remember how our trick works. We sort of picture in our head, hey,

575
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,000
imagine this quadratic has some roots. Let's call them r and s.

576
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,120
And we're trying to find the midpoint and the standard deviation. And we can

577
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,040
read off that that midpoint is the negative of the second term

578
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,360
divided by two. So in this case, that's going to be

579
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,400
negative b over 2a. Great. And then that standard deviation

580
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,720
is going to be m squared minus the product of the roots, which in this case

581
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,840
looks like negative b over 2a

582
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,560
squared minus, and the product here is what that last term is, c divided by a,

583
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,600
c over a. And remember, if you don't remember this idea that, oh, that's

584
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,160
what the distance is, just re-derive it for yourself on the

585
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,600
fly. Just go and say, okay, I remember that the product

586
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,280
p is just the product of my two roots, which can be expressed as m minus d,

587
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,240
m plus d. Oh, okay, that's something I can write as m squared minus d squared.

588
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,720
Oh, okay, that's what gives me an expression for d squared

589
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,600
in terms of m squared and p. Don't feel like you have to just come in and

590
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,720
know it off the top of your head, but after you do it a couple times it

591
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,880
sticks in your memory. So that's m, that's d, and the quadratic

592
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,760
formula is just telling us that the roots are m

593
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,840
plus and minus that standard deviation, which in this case looks like,

594
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,880
maybe I'll write it out on two lines because this will be a lot, negative b,

595
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,920
actually no, I'll write it on one line for this one, negative b plus or minus,

596
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm jumping to the original quadratic formula, a little bit

597
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,000
too hard ingrained, we'll go back to two lines, negative b

598
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,280
divided by 2a, divided by 2a plus or minus the square root.

599
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,560
Oh, I wrote this incorrectly, oh someone should have corrected me.

600
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,640
This is what d squared is equal to, d squared is this whole thing, so d itself

601
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,680
is the root of those. I'm sure lots of people were shouting that in

602
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,840
the live chat, I don't have it pulled up now, but

603
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,120
to those of you who did, much appreciated.

604
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,320
So what do we have here? Well it's going to be the square

605
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,400
of negative b over 2a

606
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,080
minus c over a, minus c over a. Okay, now we just got to expand this

607
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,440
thing, which is frankly not super fun,

608
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,480
but it'll connect it to the original quadratic formula to

609
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,720
for us. So I can pull out this 2a squared and I'm just going to write that

610
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,960
as 1 over 4a times

611
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,400
times negative b squared, negative b, yeah negative b squared, and then I want

612
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
to also pull out 1 over 4a, I want to be able to say that the last

613
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,120
term also looks like 1 over 4a times something, and that something to

614
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,360
make it equal to c over a would have to cancel out the 4, it would

615
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,240
have to cancel out an extra a, and then c, sorry because this is really

616
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,320
1 over 4a squared. Let's see, have I done this right? Yeah,

617
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,440
because I pulled out the 2a, so that should be 4 times a squared, so

618
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,160
over here I have 4 times a squared. I want that to cancel to become c over a,

619
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,200
which it looks like it does, so that's awesome.

620
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,360
So you can go over here, negative b over 2a,

621
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,000
plus or minus, and if this feels tedious that's kind of the point, the whole

622
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
quadratic formula is more complicated than it needs to be,

623
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,360
because we were just solving any quadratic that was thrown at us without

624
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,920
having to do this, but this is what happens if you don't

625
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,320
introduce any new variable names on your way.

626
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,080
It's like code that hasn't been refactored properly. Okay, so what can we

627
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,520
do here? We can factor out the 1 over 4a squared,

628
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,720
and because that's in a radical, its square root will also be 1 over 2a,

629
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,040
and then what sits inside is what remains, the well familiar negative b

630
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,280
squared minus 4a. Okay, and this this is starting to

631
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,640
look like the traditional form, because if we pull onto the numerator,

632
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,360
negative b plus or minus square root of, why am I writing negative b squared?

633
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Yeah, so this is a negative b squared, same as positive b squared.

634
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,960
What should sit on the inside here is b squared minus

635
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,000
4ac, 4ac. You can see how scatterbrained I am when

636
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm just doing some arithmetic at times. It's okay. We all forget a variable or

637
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,080
two here and there, but maybe that's why I actually care so

638
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,720
much about formulas having nice readable meanings,

639
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,080
because I think this is a very error-prone process for someone like me.

640
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,320
If I'm just trying to work through with a bunch of symbols that,

641
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,280
I don't necessarily know how to read them, I get to the end result, and it's

642
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
hard for me to say like, oh yeah, of course that's what the answer is.

643
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,600
Whereas if I look at something like the simpler variant of the quadratic formula,

644
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,920
if I basically refactor it and I'm saying, okay, does the midpoint equal

645
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240
negative b over two? I can kind of fact check, yeah, that

646
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,280
that makes sense, especially if you know a little calculus. Those of you will be

647
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,000
able to look at that quadratic formula and understand how to find the maximal

648
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,800
or minimal point. So that's a thing that gets reinforced

649
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,680
with a better pattern later on in your mathematical life,

650
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,440
always a good sign that you're learning things well. I can ask myself if it makes

651
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,600
sense that the distance looks like this. Again, that that has a readable meaning.

652
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,640
So when I'm looking at the simpler version of the quadratic formula,

653
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,600
we have m plus or minus a kind of square root of the variance, a kind of standard

654
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,760
deviation. So it's a refactoring. Now I titled this

655
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
thing, this is the simpler version of the quadratic formula,

656
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,640
and I think someone could rightfully complain. Like, is this actually simpler?

657
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,000
Because, you know, you've got a lot of steps, you've introduced new variables

658
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
into it. Now, in addition to thinking of the three

659
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,360
coefficients a, b, and c, you're telling me I also have to think

660
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,400
about like a new term m and a distance between them.

661
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,520
But for me, math is very much about trying to draw connections to other

662
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,280
patterns, and I think things are much better

663
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,760
remembered if you have that web of connections in your head

664
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,600
rather than just isolated cases. And the whole lesson here, if we think about

665
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,320
what's going on, it's about representing the same

666
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,920
information in different ways, right? Because what the quadratic formula

667
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,600
is doing for us, it's saying, can I go from my coefficients

668
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,920
a, b, and c, and can I get to the roots r and s? And we know that

669
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,320
there's a very easy way to go the other way around,

670
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,360
because we can expand something like x minus r

671
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,160
and x minus s. And really, because that a can get scaled out, it doesn't add any

672
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,960
information to the system, there's really as much information as two different

673
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,280
constants in there. So one of these directions is easy, and

674
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,240
one of these directions is hard. And this idea of information that can

675
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,120
be expressed in separate ways, and translation one direction being easy,

676
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,840
one direction hard, that comes up all the time in math. That's a very

677
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,040
useful thing to think about. And another useful thing to think about

678
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,680
is how sometimes going in that harder direction

679
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,960
will be better if you go through some intermediate step. In this case, rather

680
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,640
than thinking of your pair of numbers on the number line, just as they are,

681
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,520
doing your m plus or minus d trick, because we know that that changes how

682
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,200
you think about products. If you go through the intermediate step

683
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,800
of expressing that same information with a mean and a standard deviation,

684
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,080
that can get you to the roots. And that's all this is, it's just talking

685
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,960
about different information flow paths that can help go between various ways to

686
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
just express two numbers, whether those two numbers are the coefficients of your

687
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,600
quadratic, or the roots of the quadratic, or the mean and standard deviation.

688
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,800
So if the lesson you come away with is one of thinking, oh wow, sometimes

689
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,440
there's a lot of different ways that I can represent my data,

690
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,240
and some of them lend themselves to certain kind of problem solving better

691
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,880
than others, well then that is the proper lesson to

692
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,120
have with the quadratic equation. Okay, so I think with that I'm going to

693
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,800
call it an end to lesson number one. Really want to thank everyone who showed

694
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,880
up for this, definitely a ton of fun. Next time we're going to have the live

695
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,920
quizzing dynamic where we're going to get stats up on the screen.

696
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,000
So it's going to be pretty cool. I think this is a very cool

697
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,760
thing that two former co-workers of mine put together from Khan Academy,

698
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,560
but obviously this is the first time that we're trying it, it's a little rough

699
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,880
around the edges. So in the end what it's going to look

700
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,080
like is these bars that you're seeing live. Oh interesting, these are bigger

701
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,160
numbers than they were before. Okay, clearly they're updating, they're

702
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,640
updating! Oh this is exciting, do I have actual

703
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,160
access here? Oh it would be so fun to do this properly before we end.

704
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,240
Oh my god, oh this is so great, I think we're, I think we can do it.

705
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,760
Okay, are you ready for this guys? Okay I'm grading the answers.

706
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,800
Oh, oh wonderful, oh we can see what people answered.

707
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,640
This is great, this is how I wanted to end the stream. While I was talking just

708
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,200
in the background some magic was being done, this is wonderful.

709
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,240
So it looks like the most common answer, what's our question here?

710
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,360
What best describes your relationship with the quadratic formula?

711
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,520
And the most common answer is C. I'm a big fan, you might say I'm rooting for

712
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,320
it. So it looks like 1724 of you,

713
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,200
five short of Ramanujan's constant, are addicted to puns.

714
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Let's do a couple more, this is going to be pretty fun.

715
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,680
These were just like the joke warm-up questions before we got into the real

716
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,320
lesson, but I actually think this is the perfect way to end

717
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,920
the whole lesson, is to just kind of wind down with some of

718
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,760
what were meant to be introductory jokes. Oh it's working, I love this so much.

719
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,960
Oh and there's so many of you answering, this makes me so happy. All right so

720
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,320
what's our question here? If the quadratic formula had a

721
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:12,080
patronus, what would it be? Okay well,

722
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,720
it looks like around 800 of you, I think it will be something.

723
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,280
By the way, I'm being told right now that if there's too many of you

724
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,760
who access it, we're for sure going to break the system,

725
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,800
and I'm purposefully ignoring that because I'm having fun with this, and if

726
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,920
it breaks that kind of tickles me. So I'm being told not to say this, but

727
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,400
please go to 3b1b.co slash live and enter questions to this,

728
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,200
and then you know whenever things break that would be a perfect time to end the

729
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,360
stream, because I just think that's hilarious.

730
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,400
Okay so oh again 1791, oh I guess we blew past Ramanujan's

731
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,200
constant. Maybe I can try to see if I can grade

732
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,320
this at a point right where we're going to lock in answers where the majority

733
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,320
is 1729, I think that would be fun. Okay so it looks like a majority of

734
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,840
people went with C, if the quadratic formula had a

735
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,920
patronus, it would be an old man hunched over a chess board,

736
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,040
which is the correct answer actually. You know this this question was

737
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,920
structured as a poll where there's no correct or incorrect rating, but I don't

738
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,240
think that's right. I think it should have been structured

739
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,160
where C is the objectively correct JK Rowling would agree

740
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:27,360
style answer. All right let's do the the warm-up, question number three here.

741
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,480
Oh this is a fun one, okay what does it say?

742
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,640
What integer will most people enter into this box?

743
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,520
Okay oh lots of answers coming in. Again I really want my friends to like

744
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,040
struggle, bars all over my face. You know this

745
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,480
actually seems apropos given that the whole title of this is lockdown math

746
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,160
that it starts to look like I'm slowly being imprisoned by everyone's answers

747
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,880
and just getting locked down further and further into the quarantine situation.

748
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,960
So this one actually now there is a, where do I talk? Help!

749
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,040
Bars are attacking me, okay there's an objectively correct answer

750
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,000
because there is going to be some number that most people enter.

751
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,480
And it looks like 919 of you think that it'll be one particular thing, but we've

752
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,640
got a widespread, this is actually pretty fun. So again if you want to

753
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,040
partake in this head on over to 3b1.co.live.

754
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,040
I actually think the best way that you could do this,

755
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,600
what is the, seven! Wow I would not have guessed that, most people entered seven.

756
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,240
And in a weird way like the plurality of you are definitionally correct

757
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,400
that seven was the most commonly entered expression.

758
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,920
69 being the second most common. I can make a guess for why that might be the

759
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,480
case. Did you know that 69 is the first number where if you square it and then

760
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,080
you cube it, those two values between them encounter

761
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,120
the numbers or the digits zero through nine once and

762
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,520
only once. Yeah it's the first number with that

763
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:59,040
property, which I assume is why that was the second most popular answer.

764
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,720
But the very end, which is actually apropos at this point,

765
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,720
we can pull up another question which is going to be

766
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,360
what I was going to open the whole lesson with so you can kind of see how

767
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,120
the plan went here. How many times do you expect to use the

768
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,000
quadratic formula in your real life outside of school?

769
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,440
And in this case luckily I'm getting a little bit less you know locked down by

770
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,400
the bars trapping me in here because it seems

771
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,080
like there's a little bit more consensus around how many times people think they

772
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,240
will need to use the quadratic formula in the real life.

773
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,920
What I could do is a plot twist on this and say you know interpret this question

774
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,280
in light of the lesson rather than when will you literally use

775
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,960
negative b plus or minus square root of I always forget it square root of b

776
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,080
squared minus 4ac over 2a 2a that whole thing to when are you going

777
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,080
to use the principles of recognizing that a product of numbers

778
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,360
expressed as a difference of squares can help you solve problems or we're

779
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,280
going when are you going to use the principles

780
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,640
of expressing your data in terms of a mean and a standard deviation can help

781
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,160
you solve problems. That I think would give you wildly

782
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,960
different answers but at the moment we've got a lot of you

783
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,160
on the system and it's not breaking. I'm so happy right now.

784
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,920
I just can't tell you how much this tickles me. So it looks like we've got a

785
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,240
wide forming consensus. You know for for my sake can we can we

786
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,160
just like keep going on this? I would love to see if we can get that top

787
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,560
bar up to 1729 whatever it might be. We can all guess what it might be but

788
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,400
let's see if you can go to 3b1b.co live wherever you're watching this. I think

789
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,200
honestly the best dynamic that I could imagine is if you just pull up your

790
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,960
phone and you're watching this on a screen with the one hand and then you're

791
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,520
using your phone to answer questions. A lot of you are already watching it on

792
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,520
your phone so that wouldn't necessarily work

793
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,120
but that is the dynamic I would most expect.

794
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,320
Okay so I'm just gonna wait until we get that top bar

795
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,120
up to be Ramanujan's constant of 1729. For those of you who don't know the

796
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,480
famous story behind that number is that I think it was the mathematician

797
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,360
Hardy was visiting Ramanujan when he was in the hospital and he said

798
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,720
I found this taxi cab that I was following on my way here and

799
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,040
the number on it was 1729 and I thought to myself what a

800
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,480
wholly unremarkable integer. There's nothing special about it.

801
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,520
You know it's not a square or prime or cube or anything like that

802
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,720
but we're getting close so let me not let me not mess this up.

803
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,160
I over blew it okay. You know and so he tells this to Ramanujan he says

804
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,320
1729 has no remarkable properties and Ramanujan says oh but can't you see

805
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,240
1729 is the first number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two

806
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,920
separate ways. He says I don't understand how you can't

807
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,920
see it Hardy because 1729 is on the one hand 12

808
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,440
cubed plus one cubed but on the other hand

809
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,440
it's 10 cubed plus 9 cubed and it is the first natural number that

810
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,480
has this property that you can express it as the sum of two cubes

811
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,120
in two separate ways and that's just such a delightfully random fact that I

812
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,080
think it became immortalized in the history of math.

813
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,440
So it looks like 1769 of you which is appropriate given the second

814
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,920
second most common entry here said that you thought you would use the

815
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,800
quadratic formula zero times and honestly I agree with you.

816
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,840
I don't think you're ever going to use the quadratic formula unless you're a

817
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,040
Pixar engineer in its actual form but I think you will

818
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,000
use some of the other lessons that I tried to get across here.

819
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,600
So with that I think that is the perfect time to call things an end here.

820
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,520
Really appreciate you guys joining on this first stream. The next lesson

821
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,680
is probably but don't hold me to it going to be about how to not memorize

822
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,240
trig formulas some of the things like cosine of 2 theta sine of 3 theta

823
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,080
all of those things and it'll be on Tuesday at the same time

824
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,800
unless something changes and you can check the banner of the channel about

825
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,880
that and then for those of you watching in

826
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,520
the future hopefully this is just a long playlist of

827
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,360
high school lectures that you can join and appreciate.

828
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,640
So thank you so much for joining I hope to see you next time

829
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,840
and keep loving math.
