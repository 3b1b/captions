00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Hello and welcome to the very first episode of Lockdown Math.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,020
So in this first lecture, what I'm going to talk with you guys about is the

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,840
quadratic formula. And traditionally, I think the quadratic

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,020
formula is one of the most famously memorized things in high school. We almost

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,960
all kind of have this song that sings in our head

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,580
related to it. And yet, if you actually ask someone,

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,780
how often do you expect you're going to be using this in the real world?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,200
I mean, how many people are going to give an answer that's greater than zero to

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,500
that question? Now what I want to do is give you guys a

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,800
lesson regarding the quadratic formula that's a little bit different from the

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,940
traditional approach. And the main thing I want to focus on is

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,500
connecting it to other common patterns in math

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,680
that are useful for general problem solving. Now the tactic that I'm going to

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,660
talk through, it's not the usual completing the squares bit that some

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,460
people will learn in high school. And when you learn that, you often think,

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,220
okay, in principle, I could re-derive the quadratic formula,

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,180
but frankly, it's going to be a bit of a pain. What I will talk about is somewhat

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,900
similar to something that Po Shen-Lo put out a

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,340
couple months ago. For those of you who don't know him, he

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,120
has a YouTube channel, but more than that, he's the coach of the USIMO team,

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,280
and he has a company called X-Py, does a lot of great math stuff.

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,640
So he talked about kind of an alternate way that we could teach the quadratic

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,280
formula. The way I'm going to talk about it is a

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,020
little bit different from how he did, but certainly very similar in spirit.

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,800
Again, the upshot that I want you guys to come away with is the fact that

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,620
you should connect this to other common patterns in math so as to make yourself

27
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,300
a better problem solver. And that should be the main takeaway

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,580
lesson for, you know, this particular topic. Now these

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,460
lectures in general, I'm going to be shooting for something

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,700
roughly on the order of an hour for each one of them, and the dynamic that I'm

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,440
going for is one where there's questions that I'm asking the

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,960
audience, and then the audience interacts with it in a very, well, in a

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,260
very live way. Now the thing about live stuff though is sometimes

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,580
it doesn't go the way that you intended. So the general technology that we're

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,280
going to have for this is going to involve me

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,240
pulling up some kind of question, like for example right here,

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,980
the question is asking kind of facetiously about your relationship with

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,980
the quadratic formula. And I even had this going over the intro

39
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,640
animation for you guys. And then what you see is the statistics

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,600
associated with what the answers, you know, other people are entering are.

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,020
And they'll kind of get overlaid, we see the bars. At the moment all you see are

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,340
question marks. We don't know what the most common answer was,

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,400
but at some point I can choose to grade that and then we'll see.

44
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,060
Except for the fact that it looks like there's quite a few of you guys and it's

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,540
giving our servers a little bit of trouble.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
So we have a couple people who are going to be working on that in the

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,720
background. In the meantime I'll just be asking the questions that are pushing us

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,860
through the lesson. For future streams this will hopefully be a much more

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,340
dynamic situation where as you answer we're kind of grading it and you see how

50
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,700
it's going. For this particular one, who knows, some

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,320
magic might happen halfway through. But there's a lot of excitement among you

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,380
guys right now which is awesome and I love that. And let's see if we can

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,140
translate that into some of the math itself. So one of the questions that I

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,120
was going to ask is how many times do you expect to use the quadratic formula?

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,460
And when we were doing this a little bit earlier with a couple people, for sure

56
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,140
the most common answer was zero. Zero times is when I think I'll use the

57
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,180
quadratic formula outside of school. And a funny story about that, I actually

58
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,540
was once giving this talk at Pixar where I brought it up as this example of

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,920
something that we teach every student and it's unclear why. They're not going

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,420
to use it. And I should have known better than to

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,020
say this to a bunch of engineers at Pixar because one of them looked at me

62
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,080
and he was like oh I'll have you know I actually use the quadratic formula all

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,860
the time. His name was Tim Babb and he very

64
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,940
kindly sent over basically a storyboard for a

65
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,680
video, something I think he was pitching me on.

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,520
And the basic idea he was talking through an image that he created purely

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,880
with computer graphics. I think this is totally beautiful.

68
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,880
You would think that this is a photograph of some reflective billiard

69
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,080
balls but this is entirely computer graphics.

70
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,380
And the tactics used behind this involve something called ray tracing.

71
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,580
So the basic idea there is you sort of imagine

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,320
a camera shooting out a bunch of rays through each pixel

73
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,680
of your screen and then depending on whether it hits the sphere and how it

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,820
hits the sphere that tells you how to color each pixel.

75
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,300
Now part of that problem though is to know hey if I'm shooting a ray

76
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,260
in some direction will it hit a given sphere?

77
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,860
And so what you might do is define a certain vector,

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,220
you might imagine an amount of time that the beam of light is moving,

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,100
and then you can come up with a graph for how close

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,580
is that ray to the sphere as a function of time. And in some cases if it passes

81
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,040
through the sphere you're going to have two solutions there.

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,260
And once you work out the math it turns out this is a quadratic equation

83
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,920
so what you need is a systematic way to plug in these solutions

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,260
to a quadratic equation and it needs to be programmatic it needs to be some kind

85
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,960
of formula because you're doing this for every single pixel on the screen.

86
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,560
You also need to be able to know is it just glancing off of the sphere

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,240
or does it not go through it at all? And again all of that comes down to solving

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
a quadratic. And this particular engineer at Pixar he

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,340
did a loose back of the envelope calculation for me

90
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,480
that suggested the movie Coco probably used the quadratic formula

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,340
over a trillion times just given how many lights there are for every single

92
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,680
frame in that shot. So in some very real sense the quadratic

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,200
formula is useful to the point of being used a trillion times to produce

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,180
a movie. Nevertheless I don't necessarily think that's representative

95
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,600
of most people's future and it could be the case that the reason we teach people

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,500
this formula is because maybe they happen to be that Pixar

97
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,260
employee. You never know what's going to be useful.

98
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,100
But I want to make the case again that we can connect it to other patterns and

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,240
problem solving bits in math. And the way that I'm going to go about

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,900
this is to start in a place that's frankly completely unrelated to

101
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,060
quadratics and quadratic functions. I just want to talk about some mental

102
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,800
math tricks. Because I think if you

103
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,800
are thinking about arithmetic, something very basic, something we do in elementary

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,900
school, and you think about it deeply enough,

105
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,120
some of the patterns that you observe become relevant to stuff that you're

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
doing later on. So for example let's say I ask you to

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,760
factor the number 35. You know it's easy to see that five goes

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,800
into it and goes into it seven times. Each of

109
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,740
those is prime. Great! We know how to factor 35. Now

110
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,340
factoring is kind of an annoying task the bigger the numbers get,

111
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,960
especially if there's no obvious small factors that go into it. Because if I

112
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,480
asked you, hey let's factor 143, I mean how do you go about it? I think

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,140
the way a lot of us think about it is we initially think, okay,

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,480
we know that two doesn't go into it because it's not even. Three, there's a

115
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,100
nice divisibility check where you do one plus four plus three,

116
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,880
and that sum in this case is five plus three or eight is not divisible by three,

117
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,120
so that's out. Five we can see doesn't go into it.

118
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Seven, okay you have to think about that for a moment, but you might see that seven

119
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,640
goes into 140 evenly because that's 20 times seven.

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,640
Okay so that's right out. And at this point you might be annoyed

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,200
with whoever was asking you the question, but if you go one step further you might

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,040
see, okay 11. Actually 11 does go into it and it

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,180
ends up being 11 times 13. I just love the fact that

124
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,300
right now people probably have no idea what any

125
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,720
of this has to do with the quadratic formula, but I assure you,

126
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,820
highly related. Because what if I asked you

127
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,860
3,599? And this particular example isn't randomly chosen by the way. I was

128
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,960
reading this article about a Russian programmer

129
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,500
in an interview that he had, I think it was at Goldman Sachs, and he was

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,980
describing kind of the intensity of that interview environment.

131
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,800
And in one of them he just walks in the door, hadn't even met the person, and the

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,700
person just shouts at him, factor 3,599. You know the

133
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,680
programmer's like, uh, all right. And he actually

134
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,440
was able to spit out the factors particularly quickly, which is impressive

135
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,820
given the fact that if we imagine going through all of the different primes, you

136
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,920
know, does two go into it? No. Does three go into it? No.

137
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,600
Five? No. You're going to be sitting there for quite a while. So clearly

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,140
something different was happening in his head,

139
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,840
and the question is, what? Well one thing you might notice about the numbers that

140
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,900
I've chosen here is that 35 is awfully close to a square.

141
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,580
It's actually just one less than six squared. And maybe it kind of makes sense

142
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,660
that its factors are each kind of close to six. You know, five times seven, it's

143
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,900
probably not going to equal six times six, but the fact that they're

144
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,300
of similar sizes should be intuitive, and as it happens it's precisely one less.

145
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,620
And something similar happens with the other example I chose.

146
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,380
143 is rather close to a square number, 144. In fact it's one less. And it's no

147
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,600
coincidence that its two factors are hovering right around the square root of

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,760
that value. One of them is 12 minus 1, and the other

149
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,980
one is 12 plus 1. So it kind of makes sense that the

150
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,020
product will be something around 12 times 12.

151
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,380
And so from this you might make a guess that, hey, maybe any time

152
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,220
that you have some number that's one less than a perfect square, and this,

153
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,240
you know, it's suspiciously close to a very round seeming number, 3600.

154
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,240
Well, what is 3600? We recognize the 36 as being six

155
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
squared and 100 is 10 squared, so that's 60 times 60.

156
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,340
And maybe you think, okay, the guess, if it's going to follow the same pattern

157
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,400
as what we've seen above, is that this would be one less than 60

158
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,240
times one more than 60. But of course you don't just want a

159
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,320
pattern match. Let's see if there's a nice reason that it's a true.

160
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,520
You can work it out algebraically, which we will, but as you guys know I love

161
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,760
animation, so let's just see if there's a nice visual way to understand this

162
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,980
particular property. And if we're going to think about this,

163
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,700
the natural place to turn is to think about squares. So let me just pull up an

164
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,580
image of a square, and if we want to say, can I factor a

165
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,120
number which is one less than a square, what I might have us imagine doing is

166
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,520
taking the corner off of that square, okay? So let's say it's x by x, whatever

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,500
x is, in this case it happens to be six, but you want to think a little bit more

168
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,000
abstractly than that. And I'm going to take that bottom right

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
corner, get it out of here, we don't want it.

170
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,640
The question of factoring is to say, can I rearrange the quantity that remains

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,260
into some kind of rectangle? And in this case if I take that bottom row,

172
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
sloop it on up to the right, what you can see is it forms a rectangle,

173
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,960
one with a side length x plus one, and another with a side length x minus one.

174
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,540
So this general property holds quite well, and I think that's really cool,

175
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,160
right? You see this visually, you see that it's this neat mental arithmetic trick

176
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,700
where any time you have some sort of square number minus one,

177
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,300
you can factor that as x plus one times x minus one.

178
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,420
But of course we can go one step further than that if we really want to.

179
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,360
It doesn't have to be one sitting there. If we go back to our diagram,

180
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,060
what you might instead do is say, hey, what if I chopped off a bigger corner of

181
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,480
that square? What if I wasn't taking x squared minus

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
one, I was taking x squared minus y squared? Well, I can rearrange what remains

183
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,200
into a rectangle where it's x plus y on one side and then x minus y on the other side.

184
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,120
Now that's the geometric way that you can view it, which I think gives a certain satisfaction.

185
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,700
And when we view it in terms of numbers, it gives us a reminder of how powerful it is.

186
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,700
And yet somehow when we do this algebraically, the magic is a little bit lost.

187
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,480
It's definitely easier to see, and that demonstrates the power of algebra.

188
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,640
But if I just said x plus y times x minus y, actually, you know what,

189
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,380
let me change the variable names there. I don't like x and y because those don't

190
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,720
necessarily have the same meaning. What I might do is try to picture,

191
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,200
you know, let's picture the original two numbers that we had,

192
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,640
something that's like 59 and 61 on a number line.

193
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,280
And I want to think in terms of the midpoint m and then the distance

194
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,900
between m and each of the other numbers. So plus and minus d.

195
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,640
In this case, d is just one, but in principle, it might be something more.

196
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,720
So if I ask you multiply m minus d times m plus d,

197
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
you know, at this point, it's pretty straightforward algebra.

198
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,900
The first term is m times m. We get m squared.

199
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,000
Next, we have negative d times m. So that's minus d m.

200
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,260
Next, we have m times plus d, m plus d.

201
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,360
That's plus d and then negative d times d. So minus d squared.

202
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,140
And indeed, what comes out is m squared minus d squared.

203
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,720
And if you're anything like me, the first time you see this in an algebra class,

204
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,420
it's just one of a whole bunch of exercises that you're doing.

205
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
You're like, yeah, okay, can expand this one way.

206
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,800
I guess some terms cancel out nicely.

207
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,720
But the more you think about this, the more intriguing it is,

208
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,580
because any two numbers we can express, you know, if I just take any numbers r and s,

209
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,400
I could write that down as some midpoint plus or minus a distance.

210
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,460
And what this is telling us is to think about products

211
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,080
is always the same as thinking about a difference of squares,

212
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,820
which is weird, because products can be very chaotic.

213
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,320
If I just walk through the number line, and I don't know,

214
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,620
we I say look at 101, 102, 103,

215
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,540
and I just say, take a look at all the numbers on the number line.

216
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,780
And I want you to systematically tell me, can each one of them be broken down

217
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,180
as a product of two smaller whole numbers?

218
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,060
Well, we know that what that's asking is, what are the primes?

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,320
Because only the primes can't be broken down like that.

220
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,280
And yet, evidently, that's a very similar question to saying,

221
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,220
when can I walk through those numbers and say,

222
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,340
hey, am I able to express you as a difference of squares?

223
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,680
Could I add a square number to you to get another square?

224
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
That still feels hard.

225
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,660
But that feels like a very different question to me.

226
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,640
So I think if you were doing some arithmetic,

227
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,780
and you had this in the back of your mind, that's a good pattern.

228
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,920
And that's a pattern that's going to come up later in life.

229
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,220
For example, let's say later in life,

230
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,820
you find yourself wanting to understand quadratic functions.

231
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,660
And so here, we're going to talk about the simpler version of the quadratic formula,

232
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,080
which is really just refactoring the original thing.

233
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,000
But I hope you see, it's much easier to actually solve

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,100
a random quadratic that's thrown at you,

235
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,880
if you're going by the method that I want to show you right here.

236
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,860
So what's the task?

237
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,960
Anytime you have some function that looks like ax squared plus bx plus c,

238
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,860
okay, for any numbers a, b, and c.

239
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,860
So maybe that's something like 3x squared minus 4x plus 5.

240
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,700
And you want to know when that equals zero, what are the two roots?

241
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,040
Now, this is actually equivalent to rescaling everything.

242
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,400
And I think it's a good common pattern to rescaling,

243
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,920
where I'm going to divide everything by a.

244
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
So I just want that first coefficient to be equal to a.

245
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,900
Because that's way easier to work with.

246
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,420
So I'm going to call that x squared plus b prime x plus c prime,

247
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,260
where b prime and c prime are just the rescaled versions there.

248
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,140
And this is a different function.

249
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,420
It is a different quadratic function, but the roots are going to be the same.

250
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,320
And one way that you might see this is if you just graph them.

251
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,700
So let's go over and pull up our best friend of Desmos, right?

252
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,760
So let's say I have some kind of parabola.

253
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,620
In this case, I've written it so that one of the roots is going to be two and the other is four.

254
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,540
And then g of x here is just the scaled version of the expanded version of that.

255
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,780
It's exactly the same graph.

256
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,800
But let's say I wanted to scale that up and down, right?

257
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,900
So I might take this and then I will multiply it by some kind of constant.

258
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,640
What do you guys want to call that constant?

259
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,720
See, this is the thing.

260
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,100
If I had the question framework working right now, I could just ask you,

261
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,280
what do you want the constant to be?

262
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,740
And we would see the statistics come up with what people had.

263
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,780
But instead, maybe I'll throw in a slider.

264
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,920
And as I change that, the function changes.

265
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,060
It is a different function, but the roots are still two and four.

266
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,600
So solving for this rescaled version of the quadratic is the same.

267
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,940
And that should kind of make sense because s times zero is always going to be zero.

268
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,760
So it doesn't matter how much we scale it.

269
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,060
So going back to what we're working with here,

270
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,840
the reason that I think it's much nicer to make sure that that leading coefficient is a one

271
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,580
is because if we're thinking of our quadratic in terms of its roots,

272
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,540
and I say, okay, you know, it's going to intersect the x-axis at r and s,

273
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,220
or maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but let's just write one that does like this.

274
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:11,580
Another way that I could express that particular quadratic is as x minus r times x minus s.

275
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,540
Because if I plug in r, it's clear that we're going to get zero.

276
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,240
And if I plug in s, again, this term will also cancel out to zero.

277
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,040
So if I expand this, whatever r and s are, they're the unknowns,

278
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,180
I should get the same thing as what we have up here.

279
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,820
And this is generally useful.

280
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,440
This is not just for the quadratic formula, but a very good relationship to have with polynomials

281
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,300
is to know how the roots correspond to the coefficients,

282
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,420
especially in a circumstance where that leading coefficient is one,

283
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,520
and the whole polynomial has been kind of normalized in that way.

284
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,120
And in this case, if you just expand it out, what we'll get is x squared minus r plus s

285
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,940
times x, because we have this minus r times x and then x times minus s.

286
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,860
And then the constant term will be negative r times negative s, so that becomes a positive r

287
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,340
times s. Okay, so what does this tell us?

288
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,460
This tells us the first two of the three key facts that are needed to be able to solve

289
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,460
any quadratic without really needing to memorize all that much.

290
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,780
So the first key fact is that this b value, I'll call it b prime,

291
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,340
just to remind ourselves that it's after you've scaled things down,

292
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,460
is the same as the negative sum of the two roots.

293
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,800
Okay, and then similarly, c prime is going to be the product of those two roots,

294
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,680
which is kind of cool, because what we have right here is,

295
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,620
you know, it's a system that feels like it should have a solution.

296
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,840
We have two equations and two unknowns, but it's not obvious how we would go about solving it.

297
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,660
And every now and then, I think classes will have a unit in factoring quadratics,

298
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,980
where they basically tell you to just guess and check.

299
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,500
So in some very fortunate circumstances, if you have something like,

300
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,300
you know, x squared, let's see, minus 7x plus 12.

301
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,640
They basically say, see if you can guess and find two different numbers that add up to be 7

302
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
and that multiply to be 12.

303
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,500
And if you just kind of sit back there and think, you're like, okay, can I find any two numbers that

304
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,320
add to 7 and multiply to 12?

305
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,180
Well factoring 12, we get 3 and 4, and 3 and 4 do add to 7.

306
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,420
So yeah, in that case, you just totally luck out.

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,220
And you could write this as x minus 3 and x minus 4, because those are the two roots.

308
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,860
And then you typically move on from that chapter and it's like, well, in most cases,

309
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,300
you won't be able to just guess and check.

310
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,520
And in any case, what you're going to look for is a general formula anyway,

311
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,220
so hope you had fun with that.

312
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,300
But it turns out there's actually a systematic way to take this puzzle of finding two numbers

313
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,300
that have a known sum and a known product and figure out what they are.

314
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,680
And the key comes down to thinking in terms of not the two numbers themselves,

315
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,480
but the mean of those two numbers, and then the distance between that mean and each one of them.

316
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,220
And you can see where this is going.

317
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,320
This is why we talked about difference of squares, because the third key fact to come away with,

318
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,580
or to come into it with, I should maybe say,

319
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:18,820
is that we could re-express that product as m minus d times m plus d.

320
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,140
And you see where I'm going, right?

321
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,480
That means that the product that we know looks like m squared minus d squared.

322
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,660
So just to give an example here, it's often much more helpful to have numbers.

323
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:42,800
Let's say that you were given a quadratic like x squared, I don't know, let's do six,

324
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,680
even numbers will make this easier for us, and then seven.

325
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,080
And you were tasked with knowing when does this equal zero?

326
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
So I haven't told you how to solve it yet,

327
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,080
but these three key facts are going to be enough to just basically walk yourself into the answer.

328
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,340
Well, what is m, right?

329
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,020
As m plus or minus d for some kind of midpoint.

330
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,280
Well, that midpoint is the sum of the two numbers over two.

331
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,040
That's how we define averages.

332
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,780
And because we know the sum of the two numbers is negative b prime,

333
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,380
that's the same as negative b prime over two, which you can basically read off of the equation

334
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,060
as just negative one half times whatever's sitting right there,

335
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,720
which in this case will be negative three.

336
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,960
Awesome, we know what m is.

337
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,780
But look at the equation we have up here.

338
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,840
We have an expression for c, the last coefficient, in terms of m, which we now know,

339
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,640
and d, which is the only thing we don't know left.

340
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,120
So we could rearrange this, and so that was saying c prime is that,

341
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,220
we could say that d squared, the square of this kind of standard deviation between our roots,

342
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,580
is m squared minus c prime, the product of the two roots.

343
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,820
But we know both of those values, we could just write that down over here.

344
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,780
Maybe I'll change colors again, be a little flamboyant.

345
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,660
d squared is equal to m squared, which in our example turns out to be nine,

346
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,380
minus c prime, which is that last coefficient, or seven.

347
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,120
Seven.

348
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,160
Handwriting is terrible, but I think you guys can work with me.

349
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
You see why I usually animate stuff.

350
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
So that means that's two.

351
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,820
So look, when we said r and s is some midpoint plus or minus a distance,

352
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,940
that midpoint is negative three, plus or minus,

353
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,380
well if d squared is two, that means d is the square root of two.

354
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,680
There you go.

355
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,420
You could do that for any quadratic that I give you.

356
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
You could just walk through that particular process.

357
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,840
And let me just show you what it looks like in general,

358
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,120
so that you can maybe remember it as a formula if you wanted to.

359
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:54,720
In general, for any quadratic, that midpoint is just the rescaled version of b

360
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,560
if the leading coefficient wasn't already one, divided by two.

361
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,380
And then that distance, well what did we just do?

362
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:10,220
We took the square root of the midpoint squared minus the product of the two.

363
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,760
And when I'm sort of thinking into my head, I've been saying like m squared minus p,

364
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
just because p has a readable meaning.

365
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I think of it as the midpoint squared minus the product.

366
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,460
But of course p in this context is just whatever the last coefficient of our quadratic was.

367
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,780
So over in this example, the product of the two coefficients was seven.

368
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,400
So for me, what I think the simpler quadratic formula is,

369
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,380
if you're going to memorize anything, is to come away and say

370
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,680
it's m plus or minus the square root of m squared minus p.

371
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,100
All you have to do is first find m, which is, you know,

372
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,480
just a factor times one of the coefficients you're looking at,

373
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,040
and then find p, which is also, if not already, a factor,

374
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,700
a coefficient that you're looking at, a rescaling of one of them.

375
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,160
So this to me is way simpler than the traditional quadratic formula.

376
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,360
And if you were to try to sing a song to yourself for it, the song is almost too short.

377
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,900
It's no fun.

378
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,900
You're just sitting there like m plus or minus square root of m squared minus p.

379
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,840
That's it.

380
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,700
No song.

381
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,640
No song to be had.

382
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,720
So let's do a couple practice problems, because I do think practice will make it easier.

383
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,920
And for future streams, again, it'll ultimately be the case that I'm giving you these questions,

384
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,240
and then you'll be able to go to 3b1b.co.live and answer them.

385
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,520
But because there's too many of you, we can't have any fun today.

386
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,000
This is the equivalent of trying to run a class where you have, you know, I don't know,

387
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,320
20 seats sitting out and you're going to do a normal lecture.

388
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,640
And then there's just people banging at the doors and trying to cram themselves in,

389
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,740
and the fire marshal comes in and they're like, ah, you got to cut out the class.

390
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,660
You can't have this the way that you hoped for.

391
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,700
But it's cool that there's so many of you here enthusiastic to learn about math.

392
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,680
So let's just do some examples.

393
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,080
Okay.

394
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,920
That'll kind of highlight what this process looks like.

395
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,680
Let's say we had x squared plus 10x plus three.

396
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,360
So in this case, it's nicely already rescaled for us.

397
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,220
That's always lovely.

398
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,620
So I often, I just like to draw the picture for myself,

399
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,740
whether or not the two roots turn out to be real or even positive.

400
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,040
It's just nice to remind myself what we're looking for.

401
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,100
We're looking for where the two roots are.

402
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,740
And I know that a different way to think about products is to think about a difference of squares.

403
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,620
So I just kind of think in my head,

404
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,000
okay, I'll be thinking of that in terms of their mean and the kind of standard deviation.

405
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,040
So I just write down for myself, what does that mean?

406
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,860
Well, it's negative b prime over two.

407
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,260
And if I forget that fact, if I forget that that's what the sum of the two roots is,

408
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,000
I could always just go through this little rigmarole again and say, okay,

409
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,340
if I systematically wanted it to be a quadratic with roots r and s,

410
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,480
this is what it would look like.

411
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,800
This is how it would expand.

412
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,280
So you can re-derive it on the fly.

413
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,740
There's not too much memorization needed.

414
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,980
In this context, that works out to be negative five.

415
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,640
And by the way, if I do ever make any mistakes, which I'm quite positive I will,

416
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,460
go ahead and throw them in the chat and those will be forwarded to me

417
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,360
and I'll be able to correct myself there.

418
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,940
So we know the midpoint.

419
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,260
And then we just ask ourselves, what's the square of the distance?

420
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,720
And based on difference of squares, that'll be that midpoint squared minus the product,

421
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,380
which in this context is negative five squared or 25 minus the product,

422
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,860
which is that last coefficient, minus three.

423
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,640
So what are the roots r and s?

424
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:27,240
Well, it's negative five plus or minus the square root of 25 minus three or 22.

425
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,540
There you go.

426
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,060
Another quadratic solved.

427
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,180
Ain't no thing.

428
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,660
Let's try another.

429
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,380
Just because I do think it's kind of nice to get a little bit of practice here.

430
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,880
And as I'm going, if you have a piece of paper and pencil, please follow along.

431
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,740
If you can just kind of race ahead and do the same process before I do it, that's awesome.

432
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,740
That is the best kind of learning experience.

433
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,840
If you're watching this in the future, by the way,

434
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600
as with any video, I highly encourage you to pause and ponder.

435
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,780
I really think that's the best way to learn math.

436
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,660
If you're looking at some kind of lecture in those crucial moments where there's a question asked,

437
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,640
pause, see if you can do it yourself and then see what the answer turns out to be.

438
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,860
I guarantee you'll learn more effectively that way.

439
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,360
I don't know.

440
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,900
What should we do?

441
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,960
Let's do maybe three x squared.

442
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,060
I think I wrote one down earlier, didn't I?

443
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,940
Just as kind of a offhanded thing.

444
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,360
What did I write?

445
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,980
That wasn't there.

446
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,900
Oh yeah, it was at the top.

447
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,000
Let's do that one.

448
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,680
Three x squared minus four x plus five.

449
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,720
Why not?

450
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,860
Three x squared minus four x plus five.

451
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,320
All right.

452
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,360
So in this case, step one, we've got to rescale things.

453
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,560
The first one gives the coefficients a nice readable meaning.

454
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,720
Minus four thirds x plus five thirds.

455
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:42,580
Great.

456
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,860
And now same process.

457
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,920
I'm sort of thinking in my head of this particular image where I want to know the midpoint and the distance.

458
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,160
So I say that midpoint is negative of this second coefficient divided by two.

459
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,160
So that will become positive four thirds.

460
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,420
But then that four divided by two gives us a two.

461
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,080
So that midpoint will be two thirds.

462
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,280
And then the distance squared is m squared minus the product, which in this case is five thirds.

463
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,120
Okay.

464
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,460
And m squared in this case is, let's see, two thirds squared minus five thirds.

465
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,680
All right.

466
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,940
So this one, you know, it gets a little messier.

467
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,580
We've got to work out our fractions, but that's not too bad.

468
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,940
Two thirds squared is going to be four ninths.

469
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,980
Oh, I'm off screen a little.

470
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,320
And then what is five thirds in terms of ninths?

471
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,940
That's going to be fifteen ninths if I'm not wrong.

472
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
So we end up getting a negative number, which is always fun.

473
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,820
So here we have negative eleven ninths.

474
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:45,900
Okay.

475
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,960
So what that means is that our final answer, the roots of this polynomial are in s.

476
00:27:51,320 --> 00:28:00,000
The values that will make the polynomial zero are going to be two thirds plus or minus the square root of

477
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,680
negative eleven over d.

478
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,520
Negative eleven over d.

479
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,920
What am I saying?

480
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,540
Negative eleven over nine.

481
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,820
Okay.

482
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,400
So that's fun.

483
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,180
In this case, the square root is a negative.

484
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,240
So that means we have complex roots.

485
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,100
And there's actually a very fun way to think about the way that complex roots play into this

486
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,640
difference of squares perspective on the quadratic formula.

487
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,840
Let me actually try it with a simpler example, but it ends up relating to the Pythagorean theorem,

488
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,940
which I think is cool because the whole purpose of this is to try to connect

489
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,420
various patterns in math that come up a lot.

490
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,940
Things that might be useful outside of this particular class that you're doing.

491
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,220
So I actually have written down for myself an example that will work out with nice numbers here.

492
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,000
I mean nice-ish.

493
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,340
X squared minus six x plus ten.

494
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,640
Okay.

495
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,760
So we go through the same rigmarole.

496
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,700
We say m, the midpoint, is going to be negative b prime over two.

497
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,040
So in that case, it works out to just be three because we take the negative of this term and divide by two.

498
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,920
d squared is going to be m squared.

499
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,620
So three squared is nine minus the product, which in this case is ten.

500
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,540
So nicely that's exactly negative one, which means that our two roots,

501
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,880
and I'm down to the y or on the page that I've been writing with here,

502
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,540
our two roots are three plus or minus i.

503
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:20,880
Okay.

504
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,260
So what that means for us is that the actual parabola here,

505
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,580
it doesn't look like something that crosses the x-axis.

506
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,820
Instead it would be something that maybe sits above it.

507
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,680
But it does have imaginary roots.

508
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,460
So if we were to look at the input space, not just in terms of the real number line,

509
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,900
but let me draw it out.

510
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,340
Let me go back to black.

511
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,920
Black will be our complex plane color for this moment.

512
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,560
We'll call this our imaginary axis,

513
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,640
where numbers like i and negative i, the square root of one,

514
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,120
or maybe I should say square roots of one, it's got two of them.

515
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
You interchange them, it's fine.

516
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,740
And then we've got just the real numbers.

517
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,840
One, two, three, four.

518
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,520
So in this case, our two roots live at three plus i and three minus i.

519
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,720
So this, I should be very clear, this is not an x-axis and a y-axis.

520
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,100
This entire plane now is where the input lives, where x lives.

521
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,820
If you were going to graph it, you'd get some kind of graph that's outside of the paper.

522
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,360
And any of you who've watched the channel Welsh Labs,

523
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,000
which if you haven't, you absolutely should,

524
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,480
might be bringing to mind right now an absolutely awesome like artificial reality effect he does,

525
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,980
where he sort of pulls out that graph.

526
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
Highly worth watching, super great moment.

527
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,020
But what's interesting about this is if we look at the magnitude of the roots, okay?

528
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
Because I could ask you, what is the magnitude of that root?

529
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,700
And it's a right triangle that we're looking at.

530
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,560
We've switched from algebra to geometry now.

531
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,580
And based on the Pythagorean theorem,

532
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,360
it'll be the square root of one of the lengths squared, which is in this case three squared,

533
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,380
plus the other length squared, which is one squared.

534
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,520
So square root of three squared plus one squared, and that ends up being root 10.

535
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,660
It is not a coincidence at all that the magnitude of our roots,

536
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,680
I guess sort of no pun intended,

537
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,560
the magnitude of the roots of our quadratic equation here

538
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,260
are the square root of that constant coefficient.

539
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,180
Because remember that constant coefficient is telling us what is the product of the two roots.

540
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,380
And if you know something about complex numbers,

541
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,200
you might know that if I have two complex numbers and I multiply them together,

542
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,420
the magnitude of the product is the same as the product of the magnitudes.

543
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,660
So in this case, given that I'm going to have two separate roots who are symmetric,

544
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,200
you know, it's going to be three plus or minus some imaginary number,

545
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,260
each of them is going to have the same magnitude.

546
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,000
The product of their magnitudes needs to be 10.

547
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,120
We know that offhand.

548
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,880
So you kind of know ahead of time that it should be magnitude of square root of 10.

549
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,500
And the reason that this is happening is basically because when you do difference of squares,

550
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,860
something like m plus d times m minus d,

551
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,300
but that distance is an imaginary value, i,

552
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,360
what you get is m squared minus i times d squared.

553
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,280
But because i squared is by definition negative one, you get a sum of squares.

554
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,440
So even sums of squares, which come up in geometry, Pythagorean theorem stuff, all of that,

555
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,800
can be expressed as a kind of difference of squares, which itself gives a kind of factoring.

556
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,460
And this, this shows up in a lot of very, very beautiful math later down the road.

557
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,460
One of my favorite videos that I've made actually is, oh, what did I title it?

558
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,820
I think pi hiding in prime regularities,

559
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,140
where you're counting lattice points inside a circle.

560
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,660
And the key insight associated with doing that is to realize that asking when you can

561
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,240
express something as the sum of two squares is a sort of factoring problem,

562
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,160
but it's factoring not where you're dealing with prime numbers on the real number line,

563
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,300
but primes in complex numbers, these things called Gaussian primes.

564
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,460
So even simple, I shouldn't say simple stuff, but even stuff that comes up in high school,

565
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,720
like the quadratic formula, I think if you're learning it the right way,

566
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,660
it ends up connecting to all sorts of other delightful things.

567
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,640
And remembering these patterns comes up, like I said.

568
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,220
So just to re-emphasize, how did we get here?

569
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,140
What three key facts do you need to be aware of with quadratics to be able to

570
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,960
kind of rediscover a kind of quadratic formula on the fly?

571
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,460
The first one is how to read the coefficient sitting in front of x.

572
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,400
And if we have a quadratic that looks like x squared plus b prime x plus c prime,

573
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,700
you can read that first coefficient as the negative sum of the roots.

574
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,520
You don't know that already, you can rediscover it on the fly,

575
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,680
but that is actually worth coming away with.

576
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,120
Similar with how you can read the other coefficient, it's the product of the roots.

577
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,940
Then the only other thing you need to know is that we could express that product of roots

578
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:58,100
as a difference of squares with respect to the mean and the kind of standard deviation of those roots.

579
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,640
And you can just solve any quadratic that comes to you on the fly.

580
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,440
The only thing that looks remotely like memorization is if you want to jumpstart to the end

581
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,080
and just say m plus or minus m squared minus p.

582
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,240
Now to finish things off, I think it would be very satisfying to remind ourselves that this

583
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,240
is actually equivalent to the traditional quadratic formula, something that looks much bigger.

584
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,500
So let's go ahead and actually do that exercise.

585
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,300
And again, if you can, pause and just work it out for yourself right now.

586
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,960
So let's remind ourselves of how that goes.

587
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,080
So we've got, what are we solving?

588
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,660
Any kind of quadratic.

589
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,460
Ax squared plus bx plus c.

590
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,220
We want to say no matter what a, b, and c are, give me a systematic way to find these roots.

591
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,080
Again, maybe you're doing something beautiful like ray tracing.

592
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,300
Let me pull up that image again.

593
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,300
That was a really nice image.

594
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,140
I just can't believe that this is something that a computer generated.

595
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,380
I guess I should believe it because like Pixar movies are amazing.

596
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,000
But evidently, if you know the kind of math that can lead you to create an image like this one,

597
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,400
that's the kind of thing that can get your job as an engineer at Pixar.

598
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,980
And of course, what is that math?

599
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,820
That math is exactly what we're doing right now.

600
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,740
So let's work it out again.

601
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,140
Ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero.

602
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,740
This time, we're just going to write everything in terms of a, b, and c.

603
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,120
No new variables coming up.

604
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,520
So when we do the first step of rescaling,

605
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,580
we say x squared is equal to b divided by a times x plus c divided by a.

606
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,940
We don't give it any new names.

607
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,580
Now remember how our trick works.

608
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,140
We sort of picture in our head, hey, imagine this quadratic has some roots.

609
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,000
Let's call them r and s.

610
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,320
And we're trying to find the midpoint and the standard deviation.

611
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,920
And we can read off that that midpoint is the negative of the second term divided by two.

612
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,560
So in this case, that's going to be negative b over 2a.

613
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,620
Great.

614
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:05,000
And then that standard deviation is going to be m squared minus the product of the roots,

615
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:13,180
which in this case looks like negative b over 2a squared minus,

616
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,640
and the product here is what that last term is, c divided by a, c over a.

617
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,660
And remember, if you don't remember this idea that, oh, that's what the distance is,

618
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,500
just re-derive it for yourself on the fly.

619
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:31,200
Just go and say, okay, I remember that the product p is just the product of my two roots,

620
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,240
which can be expressed as m minus d, m plus d.

621
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, okay, that's something I can write as m squared minus d squared.

622
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,340
Oh, okay, that's what gives me an expression for d squared in terms of m squared and p.

623
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,980
Don't feel like you have to just come in and know it off the top of your head.

624
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,600
But after you do it a couple times, it sticks in your memory.

625
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,280
So that's m, that's d, and the quadratic formula is just telling us that the roots are m plus and

626
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,000
minus, that's standard deviation, which in this case looks like, maybe I'll write it out on two

627
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,540
lines because this will be a lot, negative b, actually no, I'll write it on one line for this

628
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:15,940
one, negative b plus or minus, I'm jumping to the original quadratic formula, a little bit too hard

629
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:24,160
ingrained, we'll go back to two lines, negative b divided by 2a, divided by 2a plus or minus

630
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,240
the square root, oh, I wrote this incorrectly, oh, someone should have corrected me.

631
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,580
This is what d squared is equal to, d squared is this whole thing, so d itself is the root of those.

632
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm sure lots of people were shouting that in the live chat, I don't have it pulled up now, but

633
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,120
to those of you who did, much appreciated. So what do we have here? Well, it's going to be the square

634
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:58,860
of negative b over 2a minus c over a, minus c over a. Okay, now we just got to expand this thing,

635
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:06,260
which is frankly not super fun, but it'll connect it to the original quadratic formula to

636
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,420
for us. So I can pull out this 2a squared, and I'm just going to write that as 1 over 4a

637
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:22,880
times negative b squared, negative b, yeah, negative b squared, and then I want to also

638
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,280
pull out 1 over 4a, I want to be able to say that the last term also looks like 1 over 4a

639
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,880
times something, and that something to make it equal to c over a would have to cancel out the 4,

640
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,480
it would have to cancel out an extra a, and then c, sorry, because this is really 1 over 4a squared.

641
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,860
Let's see, have I done this right? Yeah, because I pulled out the 2a, so that should be 4 times a

642
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:52,520
squared, so over here I have 4 times a squared. I want that to cancel to become c over a, which

643
00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:00,060
it looks like it does, so that's awesome. So you can go over here, negative b over 2a, plus or minus,

644
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,440
and if this feels tedious, that's kind of the point. The whole quadratic formula is more

645
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,180
complicated than it needs to be, because we were just solving any quadratic that was thrown at us

646
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,140
without having to do this, but this is what happens if you don't introduce any new variable

647
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,440
names on your way. It's like code that hasn't been refactored properly. Okay, so what can we do here?

648
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,760
We can factor out the 1 over 4a squared, and because that's in a radical, its square root will also be

649
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:31,720
1 over 2a, and then what sits inside is what remains, the well familiar negative b squared minus 4a.

650
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,080
Okay, and this this is starting to look like the traditional form, because if we pull onto the

651
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,920
numerator, negative b plus or minus square root of... why am I writing negative b squared?

652
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,460
Yeah, so this is a negative b squared, same as positive b squared. What should sit on the inside

653
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:56,580
here is b squared minus 4ac. You can see how scatterbrained I am when I'm just doing

654
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:05,220
some arithmetic at times. It's okay. We all forget a variable or two here and there, but maybe that's

655
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,080
why I actually care so much about formulas having nice readable meanings, because I think this is a

656
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,960
very error-prone process for someone like me. If I'm just trying to work through with a bunch of

657
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,820
symbols that I don't necessarily know how to read them, I get to the end result, and it's hard for me

658
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,280
to say like, oh yeah, of course that's what the answer is. Whereas if I look at something like the

659
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:31,220
simpler variant of the quadratic formula, if I basically refactor it and I'm saying, okay, does

660
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,700
the midpoint equal negative b over 2? I can kind of fact check, yeah, that that makes sense, especially

661
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,500
if you know a little calculus. Those of you will be able to look at that quadratic formula and

662
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,060
understand how to find the maximal or minimal point. So that's a thing that gets reinforced with

663
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,900
a better pattern later on in your mathematical life, always a good sign that you're learning

664
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,040
things well. I can ask myself if it makes sense that the distance looks like this.

665
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,880
Again, that has a readable meaning. So when I'm looking at the simpler version of the quadratic

666
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,160
formula, we have m plus or minus a kind of square root of the variance, a kind of standard deviation.

667
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,740
So it's a refactoring. Now I titled this thing, this is the simpler version of the quadratic

668
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,080
formula, and I think someone could rightfully complain. Like, is this actually simpler? Because,

669
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,680
you know, you've got a lot of steps, you've introduced new variables into it. Now,

670
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,260
in addition to thinking of the three coefficients a, b, and c, you're telling me I also have to

671
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,760
think about like a new term m and a distance between them. But for me, math is very much

672
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,880
about trying to draw connections to other patterns, and I think things are much better remembered if

673
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,680
you have that web of connections in your head rather than just isolated cases. And the whole

674
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,180
lesson here, if we think about what's going on, it's about representing the same information in

675
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:48,540
different ways, right? Because what the quadratic formula is doing for us, it's saying, can I go

676
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:56,300
from my coefficients a, b, and c, and can I get to the roots r and s? And we know that there's a

677
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,120
very easy way to go the other way around, because we can expand something like x minus r and x minus

678
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:09,220
s. And really, because that a can get scaled out, it doesn't add any information to the system,

679
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,900
there's really as much information as two different constants in there. So one of these

680
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:20,520
directions is easy, and one of these directions is hard. And this idea of information that can be

681
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,440
expressed in separate ways and translation one direction being easy, one direction hard, that

682
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,400
comes up all the time in math. That's a very useful thing to think about. And another useful thing to

683
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,180
think about is how sometimes going in that harder direction will be better if you go through some

684
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,760
intermediate step. In this case, rather than thinking of your pair of numbers on the number line

685
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,700
just as they are, doing your m plus or minus d trick, because we know that that changes how you

686
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,280
think about products. If you go through the intermediate step of expressing that same

687
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,320
information with a mean and a standard deviation, that can get you to the roots. And that's all this

688
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,740
is, it's just talking about different information flow paths that can help go between various ways

689
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:07,180
to just express two numbers, whether those two numbers are the coefficients of your quadratic,

690
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,460
so if the lesson you come away with is one of thinking, oh wow, sometimes there's a lot of

691
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,520
different ways that I can represent my data, and some of them lend themselves to certain kind of

692
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,040
problem solving better than others, well then that is the proper lesson to have with the quadratic

693
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,900
equation. Okay, so I think with that I'm going to call it an end to lesson number one. Really want

694
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:30,720
to thank everyone who showed up for this, definitely a ton of fun. Next time we're going to have the

695
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,420
live quizzing dynamic where we're going to get stats up on the screen, so it's going to be pretty

696
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:41,240
cool. I think this is a very cool thing that two former co-workers of mine put together from Khan

697
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,020
Academy, but obviously this is the first time that we're trying it, it's a little rough around the

698
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,300
edges, so in the end what it's going to look like is these bars that you're seeing live. Oh

699
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,740
interesting, these are bigger numbers than they were before. Okay, clearly they're updating,

700
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,780
they're updating. Oh this is exciting. Do I have actual access here? Oh it would be so fun to do

701
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:05,400
this properly before we end. Oh my god, oh this is so great, I think we can do it. Okay, are you

702
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:12,580
ready for this guys? Okay, I'm grading the answers. Oh, oh wonderful, oh we can see what people answered.

703
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,240
This is great, this is how I wanted to end the stream. While I was talking just in the background

704
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,040
some magic was being done, this is wonderful. So it looks like the most common answer, what's our

705
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,220
question here? What best describes your relationship with the quadratic formula? And the most common

706
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:34,200
answer is C. I'm a big fan, you might say I'm rooting for it. So it looks like 1724 of you,

707
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,780
five short of Ramanujan's constant, are addicted to puns. Let's do a couple more, this is going to be

708
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:50,200
pretty fun. These were just like the joke warm-up questions before we got into the real lesson, but

709
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,640
I actually think this is the perfect way to end the whole lesson, is to just kind of wind down with

710
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:04,180
some of what were meant to be introductory jokes. Oh it's working, I love this so much. Oh and there's

711
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:10,580
if the quadratic formula had a patronus, what would it be? Okay well

712
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,080
it looks like around 800 of you think it will be something.

713
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:24,440
By the way, I'm being told right now that if there's too many of you who access it, we're for

714
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,860
sure going to break the system, and I'm purposefully ignoring that because I'm having fun with this and

715
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:35,660
if it breaks that kind of tickles me. So I'm being told not to say this, but please go to 3b1b.co

716
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:40,920
live and enter questions to this, and then you know whenever things break that would be a perfect time

717
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,500
to end the stream because I just think that's hilarious. Okay so oh again 1791, oh I guess we

718
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,300
blew past Ramanujan's constant. Maybe I can try to see if I can grade this at a point right where

719
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:58,660
we're going to lock in answers where the majority is 1729, I think that would be fun. Okay so

720
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:05,020
it looks like a majority of people went with C. If the quadratic formula had a patronus, it would be

721
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,500
an old man hunched over a chessboard, which is the correct answer actually. You know this

722
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,220
question was structured as a poll where there's no correct or incorrect rating, but I don't think

723
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,480
that's right. I think it should have been structured where C is the objectively correct

724
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:26,160
JK Rowling would agree style answer. All right let's do the the warm-up question number three here.

725
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:33,780
Oh this is a fun one. Okay what does it say? What integer will most people enter into this box?

726
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,940
Okay oh oh lots of answers coming in. Again I really want my friends to like struggle,

727
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:45,120
I have bars all over my face. You know this actually seems apropos given that the whole

728
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,080
title of this is locked down math that it starts to look like I'm slowly being imprisoned by

729
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,580
everyone's answers and just getting locked down further and further into the quarantine situation.

730
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:04,340
So this one actually now there is an objectively correct answer because there is going to be some

731
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:10,060
number that most people enter and it looks like 919 of you think that it'll be one particular

732
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,540
thing, but we've got a widespread. This is actually pretty fun. So again if you want to partake in this

733
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:21,680
head on over to 3b1.co.live. I actually think the best way that you could do this.

734
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,540
Oh what is the seven? Wow I would not have guessed that most people entered seven and in a weird way

735
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:34,480
like the plurality of you are definitionally correct that seven was the most commonly entered

736
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,220
expression. 69 being the second most common. I can make a guess for why that might be the case.

737
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:46,240
Did you know that 69 is the first number where if you square it and then you cube it those two

738
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,760
values between them encounter the numbers or the digits zero through nine once and only once.

739
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,860
Yeah it's the first number with that property which I assume is why that was the second most

740
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:04,180
popular answer. But the very end which is actually apropos at this point we can pull up another

741
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,300
question which is going to be what I was going to open the whole lesson with so you can kind of see

742
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:15,420
how the plan went here. How many times do you expect to use the quadratic formula in your real

743
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:21,040
life outside of school? And in this case luckily I'm getting a little bit less you know locked

744
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,000
down by the bars trapping me in here because it seems like there's a little bit more consensus

745
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:31,020
around how many times people think they will need to use the quadratic formula in the real life.

746
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:38,660
What I could do is a plot twist on this and say you know interpret this question in light of the

747
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,700
lesson rather than when will you literally use negative b plus or minus square root of

748
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:50,180
I always forget it square root of b squared minus 4ac over 2a that whole thing to when are you going

749
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,000
to use the principles of recognizing that a product of numbers expressed as a difference

750
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,060
of squares can help you solve problems or when are you going to use the principles of expressing

751
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,700
your data in terms of a mean and a standard deviation can help you solve problems. That

752
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,300
I think would give you wildly different answers but at the moment we've got a lot of you on the

753
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,520
system and it's not breaking and I'm so happy right now I just can't tell you how much this

754
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,060
tickles me. So it looks like we've got a wide forming consensus you know for for my sake can we

755
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:26,280
can we just like keep going on this I would love to see if we can get that top bar up to 1729

756
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,780
whatever it might be at the moment we can all guess what it might be but let's see if you can go

757
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,920
to 3b1b.co slash live wherever you're watching this I think honestly the best dynamic that I

758
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,680
could imagine is if you just pull up your phone and you're watching this on a screen with the

759
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,440
one hand and then you're using your phone to to answer questions a lot of you are already watching

760
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,360
it on your phone so that wouldn't necessarily work but that is the dynamic I would I would most

761
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,820
expect. Okay so I'm just going to wait until we get that top bar up to be Ramanujan's constant

762
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:03,780
of 1729. For those of you who don't know the famous story behind that number is that I think

763
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:09,760
the mathematician Hardy was visiting Ramanujan when he was in the hospital and he said I found

764
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,620
this taxi cab that I was following on my way here and the number on it was 1729 and I thought to

765
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:21,200
myself what a wholly unremarkable integer there's nothing special about it you know it's not a

766
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,660
square or prime or cube or anything like that but we're getting close so let me not let me not mess

767
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:34,880
this up oh I over blew it okay you know and so he tells this to Ramanujan he says 1729 has no

768
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,420
remarkable properties and Ramanujan says oh but can't you see 1729 is the first number that can

769
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,680
be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two separate ways he says I don't understand how

770
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:55,400
you can't see it Hardy because 1729 is on the one hand 12 cubed plus one cubed but on the other hand

771
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:02,500
it's 10 cubed plus nine cubed and it is the first natural number that has this property that you

772
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,240
can express it as the sum of two cubes in two separate ways and that's just such a delightfully

773
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:15,120
random fact that I think it became immortalized in the history of math so it looks like 1769 of you

774
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,380
which is appropriate given the second question second most common entry here said that you

775
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,380
thought you would use the quadratic formula zero times and honestly I agree with you I don't think

776
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,160
you're ever going to use the quadratic formula unless you're a Pixar engineer in its actual form

777
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,060
but I think you will use some of the other lessons that I tried to get across here so with that I

778
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,260
think that is the perfect time to call things an end here really appreciate you guys joining on

779
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:44,840
this first stream the next lesson is probably but don't hold me to it going to be about how to not

780
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,820
memorize trig formulas some of the things like cosine of 2 theta sine of 3 theta all of those

781
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:55,760
things and it'll be on Tuesday at the same time unless something changes and you can check the

782
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,620
banner of the channel about that and then for those of you watching in the future hopefully

783
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:04,880
this is just a long playlist of high school lectures that you can join and appreciate

784
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,940
so thank you so much for joining I hope to see you next time and keep loving math
