00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
The phrase exponential growth is familiar to most people, and yet human intuition has

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,640
a hard time really recognizing what it means sometimes.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,680
We can anchor on a sequence of small seeming numbers and then become surprised when suddenly

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,220
those numbers look big, even if the overall trend follows an exponential perfectly consistently.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,480
This right here is the data for the recorded cases of COVID-19, aka the coronavirus, at

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
least at the time I'm writing this.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,940
Never one to waste an opportunity for a math lesson, I thought this might be a good time

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,620
for all of us to go back to the basics on what exponential growth really is, where it

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,840
comes from, what it implies, and maybe most pressingly how to know when it's coming

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,780
to an end.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,960
Exponential growth means that as you go from one day to the next, it involves multiplying

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
by some constant.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,320
In our data, the number of cases in each day tends to be a multiple of about 1.15 to 1.25

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,760
of the number of cases the previous day.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Viruses are a textbook example of this kind of growth, because what causes new cases are

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,600
the existing cases.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,840
If the number of cases on a given day is n, and we say that each individual with the virus

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,260
is exposed to, on average, e people on a given day, and each one of those exposures has a

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,520
probability p of becoming a new infection, then the number of new cases on a given day

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,200
is e times p times n.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,800
The fact that n itself is a factor in its own change is what really makes things go

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,600
fast, because if n gets big, it means the rate of growth itself is getting big.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,240
One way to think about this is that as you add the new cases to get the next day's

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,000
count, you can factor out the n, so it's just the same as multiplying by some constant

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,020
that's bigger than 1.

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,700
This is sometimes easier to see if we put the y-axis of our graph on a logarithmic scale,

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,460
which means that each step of a fixed distance corresponds to multiplying by a certain factor,

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,020
in this case each step is another power of 10.

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,000
On this scale, exponential growth should look like a straight line.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,300
Looking at our data, it seems like it took 20 days to go from 100 to 1000, and 13 days

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,240
to go from that to 10,000, and if you do a simple linear regression to find the best

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,640
fit line, you can look at the slope of that line to draw a conclusion like we tend to

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,720
multiply by 10 every 16 days on average.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,060
This regression also lets us be a little more quantitative about exactly how close the exponential

35
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,760
fit really is, and to use the technical statistical jargon here, the answer is that it's really

36
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
freaking close.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,760
But it can be hard to digest exactly what that means if true.

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,020
When you see one country with say 6,000 cases and another with 60, it's easy to think

39
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,820
that the second is doing 100 times better, and hence fine.

40
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,700
But if you're actually in a situation where numbers multiply by 10 every 16 days, another

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,940
way to view the same fact is that the second country is about a month behind the first.

42
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,140
This is of course rather worrying if you draw out the line.

43
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,820
I'm recording this on March 6th, and if the present trend continues it would mean

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:16,180
hitting a million cases in 30 days, hitting 10 million in 47 days, 100 million in 64 days,

45
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,500
and 1 billion in 81 days.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,540
Needless to say, though, you can't just draw out a line like this forever, it clearly

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,800
has to start slowing down at some point.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,540
But the crucial question is when.

49
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,580
Is it like the SARS outbreak of 2002, which capped out around 8,000 cases, or the Spanish

50
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,020
flu of 1918, which ultimately infected about 27% of the world's population?

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,020
In general, with no context, just drawing a line through your data is not a great way

52
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,660
to make predictions, but remember, there's an actual reason to expect an exponential

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
here.

54
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,660
If the number of new cases each day is proportional to the number of existing cases, it necessarily

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,180
means each day you multiply by some constant, so moving forward d days is the same as multiplying

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,620
by that constant d times.

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,380
The only way that stops is if either the number e or p goes down.

58
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,760
It's inevitable that this will eventually happen.

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,960
Even in the most perfectly pernicious model for a virus, which would be where every day

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,080
each person with the infection is exposed to a random subset of the world's population,

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,120
at some point most of the people they're exposed to would already be sick, and so they

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,560
couldn't become new cases.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
In our equation, that would mean that the probability of an exposure becoming a new

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,460
infection would have to include some kind of factor to account for the probability that

65
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,320
someone you're exposed to is already infected.

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,440
For a random shuffling model like this, that could mean including a factor like 1 minus

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,000
the proportion of people in the world who are already infected.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Including that factor, and then solving for how n grows, you get what's known in the

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,760
business as a logistic curve, which is essentially indistinguishable from an exponential at the

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,760
beginning, but ultimately levels out once you're approaching the total population

71
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,440
size, which is what you would expect.

72
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,660
True exponentials essentially never exist in the real world, every one of them is really

73
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,300
the start of a logistic curve.

74
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,980
This point right here, where that logistic goes from curving upward to instead curving

75
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,100
downward is known as the inflection point.

76
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,380
There, the number of new cases each day, represented by the slope of this curve, stops increasing

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,620
and instead stays roughly constant before it starts decreasing.

78
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,540
One number that people often follow with epidemics is the growth factor, which is defined as

79
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,580
the ratio between the number of new cases one day and the number of new cases the previous

80
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,300
day.

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,580
So just to be clear, if you were looking at all of the totals from one day to the next,

82
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,660
then tracking the changes between those totals, the growth factor is a ratio between two successive

83
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,860
changes.

84
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,620
While you're on the exponential part, this factor stays consistently above 1, whereas

85
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,820
as soon as your growth factor looks closer to 1, it's a sign that you've hit the

86
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,740
inflection.

87
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,420
This can make for another counterintuitive fact while following the data.

88
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,900
Think about what it would feel like for the number of new cases one day to be about 15%

89
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,600
more than the number of new cases the previous day, and contrast that with what it would

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,480
feel like for it to be about the same.

91
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,140
Just looking at the totals they result in, they don't really feel that different.

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,780
But if the growth factor is 1, it could mean you're at the inflection point of a logistic,

93
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,860
which would mean the total number of cases is going to max out at about 2 times wherever

94
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,280
you are now.

95
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,700
But a growth factor bigger than 1, subtle though that might seem, means you're on

96
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,380
the exponential part, which could imply there are orders of magnitude of growth still waiting

97
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,020
ahead of you.

98
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,000
Now while it's true that in the worst case situation the saturation point is around the

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,700
total population, it's of course not at all true that people with the virus are randomly

100
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,360
shuffled around the world's population like this.

101
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,840
People are clustered in local communities.

102
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,480
However, if you run simulations where there's even a little bit of travel between clusters

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,640
like this, the growth is actually not that much different.

104
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,000
What you end up with is a kind of fractal pattern, where communities themselves function

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,740
like individuals.

106
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,460
Each one has some exposure to others, with some probability of spreading the infection,

107
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:36,300
so the same underlying and exponential inducing laws apply.

108
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:47,060
Fortunately, saturating the whole population is not the only thing that can cause the two

109
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,620
factors we care about to go down.

110
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,620
The amount of exposure can also go down when people stop gathering and traveling, and the

111
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,140
infection rate can go down when people just wash their hands more.

112
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,540
The other thing that's counterintuitive about exponential growth, this time in a more

113
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,420
optimistic sense, is just how sensitive it is to this constant.

114
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,100
For example, if it's 15%, like it is as I'm recording this, and we're at 21,000

115
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,180
cases now, that would mean that 61 days from now you hit over 100 million.

116
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,740
But if through a bit less exposure and infection, that rate drops down to 5%, it doesn't

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,900
mean the projection also drops down by a factor of 3, it actually drops down to around 400,000.

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,620
So if people are sufficiently worried, there's a lot less to worry about.

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,660
But if no one is worried, that's when you should worry.

120
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,260
you
