00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,380
The phrase exponential growth is familiar to most people, and yet human intuition has

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,100
a hard time really recognizing what it means sometimes.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,700
We can anchor on a sequence of small seeming numbers and then become surprised when suddenly

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,160
those numbers look big, even if the overall trend follows an exponential perfectly consistently.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,560
This right here is the data for the recorded cases of COVID-19, aka the coronavirus, at

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,000
least at the time I'm writing this.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,000
Never one to waste an opportunity for a math lesson, I thought this might be a good time

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,660
for all of us to go back to the basics on what exponential growth really is, where it

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,840
comes from, what it implies, and maybe most pressingly how to know when it's coming

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,600
to an end.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,900
Exponential growth means that as you go from one day to the next, it involves multiplying

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,800
by some constant.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,880
In our data, the number of cases in each day tends to be a multiple of about 1.15 to 1.25

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,360
of the number of cases the previous day.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,860
Viruses are a textbook example of this kind of growth, because what causes new cases are

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,060
the existing cases.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,680
If the number of cases on a given day is n, and we say that each individual with the virus

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,860
is exposed to e people on a given day, and each one of those exposures has a probability

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,720
p of becoming a new infection, then the number of new cases on a given day is e times p

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,600
times n.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,700
The fact that n itself is a factor in its own change is what really makes things go

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,640
fast, because if n gets big, it means the rate of growth itself is getting big.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,260
One way to think about this is that as you add the new cases to get the next day's

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,840
growth, you can factor out the n, so it's just the same as multiplying by some constant

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,800
that's bigger than 1.

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,220
This is sometimes easier to see if we put the y-axis of our graph on a logarithmic scale,

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,320
which means that each step of a fixed distance corresponds to multiplying by a certain factor,

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,040
in this case each step is another power of 10.

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,060
On this scale, exponential growth should look like a straight line.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,300
Looking at our data, it seems like it took 20 days to go from 100 to 1000, and 13 days

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,280
to go from that to 10,000, and if you do a simple linear regression to find the best

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,760
fit line, you can look at the slope of that line to draw a conclusion like we tend to

33
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,780
multiply by 10 every 16 days on average.

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,020
This regression also lets us be a little more quantitative about exactly how close the exponential

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,800
fit really is, and to use the technical statistical jargon here, the answer is that it's really

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
freaking close.

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
But it can be hard to digest exactly what that means if true.

38
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,040
When you see one country with, say, 6000 cases and another with 60, it's easy to think

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,120
that the second is doing 100 times better, and hence fine.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,760
But if you're actually in a situation where numbers multiply by 10 every 16 days, another

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,920
way to view the same fact is that the second country is about a month behind the first.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,620
This is of course rather worrying if you draw out the line.

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm recording this on March 6th, and if the present trend continues it would mean

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,620
hitting a million cases in 30 days, hitting 10 million in 47 days, 100 million in 64 days,

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,540
and 1 billion in 81 days.

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,560
Needless to say, though, you can't just draw out a line like this forever, it clearly

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,440
has to start slowing down at some point.

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,520
But the crucial question is when.

49
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,680
Is it like the SARS outbreak of 2002 which capped out around 8000 cases, or the Spanish

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,440
flu of 1918 which ultimately infected about 27% of the world's population?

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,120
In general, with no context, just drawing a line through your data is not a great way

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,440
to make predictions, but remember, there's an actual reason to expect an exponential

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,020
here.

54
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,500
If the number of new cases each day is proportional to the number of existing cases, it necessarily

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,180
means each day you multiply by some constant, so moving forward d days is the same as multiplying

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,820
by that constant d times.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,900
The only way that stops is if either the number E or P goes down.

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,920
It's inevitable that this will eventually happen.

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,880
Even in the most perfectly pernicious model for a virus, which would be where every day

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,360
each person with the infection is exposed to a random subset of the world's population,

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,260
at some point most of the people they're exposed to would already be sick, and so they

62
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,500
couldn't become new cases.

63
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,320
In our equation, that would mean that the probability of an exposure becoming a new

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
infection would have to include some kind of factor to account for the probability that

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,460
someone you're exposed to is already infected.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,480
For a random shuffling model like this, that could mean including a factor like 1 minus

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,400
the proportion of people in the world who are already infected.

68
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:55,480
Including that factor, and then solving for how N grows, you get what's known in the

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,680
model.

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,060
It's not possible from an exponential at the beginning, but ultimately it levels out

71
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,720
once you're approaching the total population size, which is what you would expect.

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,840
True exponentials essentially never exist in the real world, every one of them is the

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,200
start of a logistic curve.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,720
This point right here, where that logistic curve goes from curving upward to instead

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,560
curving downward, is known as the inflection point.

76
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,240
There, the number of new cases each day, represented by the slope of this curve, stops increasing

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,460
and stays roughly constant before it starts decreasing.

78
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,620
One number that people often follow with epidemics is the growth factor, which is defined as

79
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,440
the ratio between the number of new cases one day and the number of new cases the previous

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,940
day.

81
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,680
Just to be clear, if you were looking at all of the totals from one day to the next, then

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,680
tracking the changes between those totals, the growth factor is a ratio between two successive

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,200
changes.

84
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,660
While you're on the exponential part, this factor stays consistently above one, whereas

85
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,920
as soon as your growth factor looks closer to one, it's a sign that you've hit the

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,380
inflection.

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,840
This can make for another counterintuitive fact while following the data.

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,760
Think about what it would feel like for the number of new cases one day to be about 15%

89
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,720
more than the number of new cases the previous day, and contrast that with what it would

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,640
feel like for it to be about the same.

91
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,040
Just looking at the totals they result in, they don't really feel that different.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,020
But if the growth factor is one, it could mean you're at the inflection point of a

93
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,120
logistic, which would mean the total number of cases is going to max out at about two

94
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,760
times wherever you are now.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,780
But a growth factor bigger than one, subtle though that might seem, means you're on

96
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,440
the exponential part, which could imply there are orders of magnitude of growth still waiting

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,320
ahead of you.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,100
Now, while it's true that in the worst-case situation the saturation point is around the

99
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,740
total population, it's of course not at all true that people with the virus are randomly

100
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,680
shuffled around the world's population like this.

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,160
People are clustered in local communities.

102
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,500
However, if you run simulations where there's even a little bit of travel between clusters

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,480
like this, the growth is actually not that much different.

104
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,000
What you end up with is a kind of fractal pattern, where communities themselves function

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,880
like individuals.

106
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,860
Each one has some exposure to others, with some probability of spreading the infection,

107
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,700
so the same underlying and exponential-inducing laws apply.

108
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,220
Fortunately, saturating the whole population is not the only thing that can cause the two

109
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,840
factors we care about to go down.

110
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,680
The amount of exposure can also go down when people stop gathering and traveling, and the

111
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,380
infection rate can go down when people just wash their hands more.

112
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,640
The other thing that's counterintuitive about exponential growth, this time in a more

113
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,320
optimistic sense, is just how sensitive it is to this constant.

114
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,940
For example, if it's 15%, like it is as I'm recording this, and we're at 21,000

115
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,200
cases now, that would mean that 61 days from now you hit over 100 million.

116
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,860
But if through a bit less exposure and infection, that rate drops down to 5%, it doesn't mean

117
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,100
the projection also drops down by a factor of 3, it actually drops down to around 400,000.

118
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,200
So if people are sufficiently worried, there's a lot less to worry about.

119
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,680
But if no one is worried, that's when you should worry.
