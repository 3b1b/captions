1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,296
The phrase exponential growth is familiar to most people, 

2
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:11,100
and yet human intuition has a hard time really recognizing what it means sometimes.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,547
We can anchor on a sequence of small seeming numbers and then 

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,411
become surprised when suddenly those numbers look big, 

5
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,160
even if the overall trend follows an exponential perfectly consistently.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,220
This right here is the data for the recorded cases of COVID-19, 

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,000
aka the coronavirus, at least at the time I'm writing this.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,016
Never one to waste an opportunity for a math lesson, 

9
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:37,083
I thought this might be a good time for all of us to go back to the basics on what 

10
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,415
exponential growth really is, where it comes from, what it implies, 

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,600
and maybe most pressingly how to know when it's coming to an end.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,700
Exponential growth means that as you go from one day to the next, 

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,800
it involves multiplying by some constant.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,077
In our data, the number of cases in each day tends to be a multiple 

15
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:59,360
of about 1.15 to 1.25 of the number of cases the previous day.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,732
Viruses are a textbook example of this kind of growth, 

17
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:07,060
because what causes new cases are the existing cases.

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,875
If the number of cases on a given day is n, and we say that each 

19
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:18,411
individual with the virus is exposed to e people on a given day, 

20
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:24,064
and each one of those exposures has a probability p of becoming a new infection, 

21
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:28,600
then the number of new cases on a given day is e times p times n.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,304
The fact that n itself is a factor in its own change is what really makes things go fast, 

23
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:39,640
because if n gets big, it means the rate of growth itself is getting big.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,253
One way to think about this is that as you add the new cases to 

25
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:47,378
get the next day's growth, you can factor out the n, 

26
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:51,800
so it's just the same as multiplying by some constant that's bigger than 1.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,605
This is sometimes easier to see if we put the y-axis of our graph on a logarithmic scale, 

28
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:01,665
which means that each step of a fixed distance corresponds to multiplying by 

29
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:05,040
a certain factor, in this case each step is another power of 10.

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,060
On this scale, exponential growth should look like a straight line.

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,771
Looking at our data, it seems like it took 20 days to go from 100 to 1000, 

32
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:18,105
and 13 days to go from that to 10,000, and if you do a simple linear 

33
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,628
regression to find the best fit line, you can look at the slope of that 

34
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:27,780
line to draw a conclusion like we tend to multiply by 10 every 16 days on average.

35
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,061
This regression also lets us be a little more quantitative about exactly 

36
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,172
how close the exponential fit really is, and to use the technical 

37
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,520
statistical jargon here, the answer is that it's really freaking close.

38
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
But it can be hard to digest exactly what that means if true.

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,584
When you see one country with, say, 6000 cases and another with 60, 

40
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:51,120
it's easy to think that the second is doing 100 times better, and hence fine.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,960
But if you're actually in a situation where numbers multiply by 10 every 16 days, 

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,606
another way to view the same fact is that the second country is about a month behind the 

43
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:00,920
first.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,620
This is of course rather worrying if you draw out the line.

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm recording this on March 6th, and if the present trend continues 

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,095
it would mean hitting a million cases in 30 days, hitting 10 million in 47 days, 

47
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,540
100 million in 64 days, and 1 billion in 81 days.

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,011
Needless to say, though, you can't just draw out a line like this forever, 

49
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,440
it clearly has to start slowing down at some point.

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,520
But the crucial question is when.

51
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,891
Is it like the SARS outbreak of 2002 which capped out around 8000 cases, 

52
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:38,440
or the Spanish flu of 1918 which ultimately infected about 27% of the world's population?

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,373
In general, with no context, just drawing a line through your data is not a great way to 

54
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:49,020
make predictions, but remember, there's an actual reason to expect an exponential here.

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,096
If the number of new cases each day is proportional to the number of existing cases, 

56
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:57,510
it necessarily means each day you multiply by some constant, 

57
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,820
so moving forward d days is the same as multiplying by that constant d times.

58
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,900
The only way that stops is if either the number E or P goes down.

59
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,920
It's inevitable that this will eventually happen.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,538
Even in the most perfectly pernicious model for a virus, 

61
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:17,302
which would be where every day each person with the infection is exposed 

62
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:21,014
to a random subset of the world's population, at some point most of the 

63
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:25,500
people they're exposed to would already be sick, and so they couldn't become new cases.

64
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,160
In our equation, that would mean that the probability of an exposure 

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,589
becoming a new infection would have to include some kind of factor to 

66
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,460
account for the probability that someone you're exposed to is already infected.

67
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,796
For a random shuffling model like this, that could mean including a factor 

68
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:46,400
like 1 minus the proportion of people in the world who are already infected.

69
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,698
Including that factor, and then solving for how N grows, 

70
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:55,680
you get what's known in the model.

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,040
It's not possible from an exponential at the beginning, 

72
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,413
but ultimately it levels out once you're approaching the total population size, 

73
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,720
which is what you would expect.

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,540
True exponentials essentially never exist in the real world, 

75
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,200
every one of them is the start of a logistic curve.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,252
This point right here, where that logistic curve goes from curving 

77
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:16,560
upward to instead curving downward, is known as the inflection point.

78
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,158
There, the number of new cases each day, represented by the slope of this curve, 

79
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:26,460
stops increasing and stays roughly constant before it starts decreasing.

80
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,333
One number that people often follow with epidemics is the growth factor, 

81
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,895
which is defined as the ratio between the number of new cases 

82
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:40,940
one day and the number of new cases the previous day.

83
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,122
Just to be clear, if you were looking at all of the totals from one day to the next, 

84
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:49,823
then tracking the changes between those totals, 

85
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:53,200
the growth factor is a ratio between two successive changes.

86
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,369
While you're on the exponential part, this factor stays consistently above one, 

87
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,267
whereas as soon as your growth factor looks closer to one, 

88
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,380
it's a sign that you've hit the inflection.

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,840
This can make for another counterintuitive fact while following the data.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,110
Think about what it would feel like for the number of new cases one day 

91
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,691
to be about 15% more than the number of new cases the previous day, 

92
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:20,640
and contrast that with what it would feel like for it to be about the same.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,040
Just looking at the totals they result in, they don't really feel that different.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,037
But if the growth factor is one, it could mean you're at the 

95
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:33,324
inflection point of a logistic, which would mean the total number 

96
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:36,760
of cases is going to max out at about two times wherever you are now.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,446
But a growth factor bigger than one, subtle though that might seem, 

98
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:43,407
means you're on the exponential part, which could imply there 

99
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:46,320
are orders of magnitude of growth still waiting ahead of you.

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,341
Now, while it's true that in the worst-case situation the saturation point 

101
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,962
is around the total population, it's of course not at all true that people 

102
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:59,680
with the virus are randomly shuffled around the world's population like this.

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,160
People are clustered in local communities.

104
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,906
However, if you run simulations where there's even a little bit of travel 

105
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:10,480
between clusters like this, the growth is actually not that much different.

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,891
What you end up with is a kind of fractal pattern, 

107
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,880
where communities themselves function like individuals.

108
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,071
Each one has some exposure to others, with some probability of spreading the infection, 

109
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,700
so the same underlying and exponential-inducing laws apply.

110
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,866
Fortunately, saturating the whole population is not the only 

111
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,840
thing that can cause the two factors we care about to go down.

112
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,192
The amount of exposure can also go down when people stop gathering and traveling, 

113
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:56,380
and the infection rate can go down when people just wash their hands more.

114
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,298
The other thing that's counterintuitive about exponential growth, 

115
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:04,320
this time in a more optimistic sense, is just how sensitive it is to this constant.

116
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,596
For example, if it's 15%, like it is as I'm recording this, 

117
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:13,186
and we're at 21,000 cases now, that would mean that 61 days from now you hit 

118
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:14,200
over 100 million.

119
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,030
But if through a bit less exposure and infection, 

120
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,583
that rate drops down to 5%, it doesn't mean the projection 

121
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:26,100
also drops down by a factor of 3, it actually drops down to around 400,000.

122
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,200
So if people are sufficiently worried, there's a lot less to worry about.

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,320
But if no one is worried, that's when you should worry.
