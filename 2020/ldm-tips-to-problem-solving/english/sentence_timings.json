  1205.6
 ],
 [
  "It was pi radians.",
  1205.66,
  1206.66

  "What would that mean in terms of the inscribed angle theorem?",
  1207.46,
  1209.9

 [
  "It means that if we take that diameter of the circle, if it's 180 degrees, it's just drawing out a diameter, and we have an inscribed angle with lines that hit either end of that diameter, then this angle is necessarily half of that.",
  1210.8,
  1225.04
 ],
 [
  "So what it means is that we can put a right triangle inside a circle, and whenever you do that, the hypotenuse of the right triangle is exactly the diameter of that circle.",
  1225.26,
  1234.76
 ],
 [
  "It's a very cute fact.",
  1235.12,
  1236.02
 ],
 [
  "If you wanted another proof of it, that's not just via the inscribed angle theorem, there's another very wonderful leveraging of symmetry that you can do, where basically you take this point and you say, I'm going to reflect it through the origin, reflect it through the center of my circle, and see where I get.",
  1236.52,
  1253.8
 ],
 [
  "And recognize that reflecting through the center is the same as rotating the whole image 90 degrees.",
  1254.62,
  1258.9
 ],
 [
  "So if I rotated the image, not 90, 180 degrees, my other vertex would end up at that same point.",
  1259.56,
  1266.78
 ],
 [
  "But now what we have is a quadrilateral, and one of the diagonals is the diameter of the circle, but the other diagonal is also diameter of the circle, which in particular means they have the same midpoint and they're the same distance apart, and you can convince yourself a little that implies it must be a rectangle, that could also be a little side homework problem if you wanted to chase around the relevant angles.",
  1267.22,
  1287.12
 ],
 [
  "But I think that's a very beautiful way to think about Thale's theorem, that you reflect everything 180 degrees, and you necessarily conclude it must be a rectangle, which means that this is a right angle.",
  1287.28,
  1296.32
 ],
 [
  "Now for our purposes, what does that mean?",
  1296.94,
  1298.44
 ],
 [
  "Well, we've got a right triangle sitting here that's from zero, we've got one of the points here, another point on the circle.",

 [
  "Let's inscribe that in a separate circle, okay?",
  1304.36,
  1307.18

  "So I'm going to take a copy of that triangle, but I'm going to, instead of making the hypotenuse a radius of the circle, I'm going to make that hypotenuse a diameter of the circle.",
  1307.84,
  1318.44
 ],
 [
  "So this is still going to be an angle of theta, sitting right here.",
  1319.32,
  1323.48
 ],
 [
  "The, uh, basically I flipped it around, so previously it was here, but I flipped it around so that my 90 degree angle is sitting up and to the right, rather than sitting down here.",
  1324.08,
  1333.66
 ],
 [
  "The length that we care about is what happens when we project from the point at that 90 degree angle in a perpendicular fashion down onto the hypotenuse, which now looks like this.",
  1334.62,
  1345.5
 ],
 [
  "And what we care about is this long length, okay?",
  1346.38,
  1351.24

  "Let me give you a little bit of time to think about this one, because this is, uh, this is kind of a heart, part of the heart of this particular proof, and I think it's very, very pleasing to see.",
  1367.42,
  1378.02
 ],
 [
  "So it specifies that the hypotenuse of the large right triangle above has a length of one.",
  1378.64,
  1382.34

 [
  "What is the length l in terms of theta?",
  1389.94,

  1393.76,
  1396.8

 [
  "It's fun to have though.",
  1440.14,

  "That is the whole reason I'm bringing it up here.",
  1443.52,

 [
  "It's a way to relate a single angle to twice that angle.",
  1445.74,
  1448.36

 [
  "So in this context, I would draw some lines from the center of my, uh, of my new smaller circle that has radius only one half, and recognize that this is 2 theta.",
  1448.56,
  1459.6
 ],
 [
  "And this is just lovely now, isn't it?",
  1460.1,
  1461.94
 ],
 [
  "Because what is the length we care about?",
  1461.96,
  1463.48
 ],
 [
  "Part of it, excuse me, part of it is the radius, which is one half, but then the projection down according to 2 theta onto this remaining leg ends up being that radius one half times the cosine of 2 theta.",
  1464.3,
  1482.76
 ],
 [
  "And of course, that's exactly what we want it to be.",
  1483.52,
  1485.78
 ],
 [
  "We've got the whole radius, which is one half, and then we're multiplying that by 1 plus the cosine of 2 theta.",
  1485.9,
  1491.62
 ],
 [
  "It's a radius of the circle times a scaled down version of that radius.",
  1491.62,
  1495.1
 ],
 [
  "So that's two different ways of viewing the same object, which is what we get when we take this right triangle and we project down and look at what part of the hypotenuse that cuts off.",
  1495.56,
  1503.68
 ],
 [
  "And it gives us this non-trivial relationship in trigonometry between the cosine squared and the cosine of 2 theta.",
  1503.74,
  1509.36
 ],
 [
  "The fact that otherwise we were going into like complex numbers and exponentials to understand.",
  1509.46,
  1513.74
 ],
 [
  "So I think that's quite beautiful.",
  1513.96,
  1515.08
 ],
 [
  "I think that's just, um, one of the many many instances of where the inscribed angle theorem suspiciously slos- suspiciously shows up.",
  1515.14,
  1522.72
 ],
 [
  "Um, and again, what I want you to take away is this principle that if you can have one object described in two different ways, very powerful in terms of showing non-obvious, um, algebraic relations or anything that's kind of written down symbolically without immediate intuition on top of it.",
  1522.72,
  1538.64
 ],
 [
  "So with all of that, let's actually turn to the probability question that I asked at the beginning of the lecture.",
  1539.06,
  1544.32
 ],

  "So going back to our live quiz, uh, I will go ahead and grade what we- we all know know the correct answer.",
  1547.28,
  1556.42

  "So for those of you- wait a minute.",
  1556.74,
  1559.18

  "Um, so I might have like swapped around what the answers were.",
  1566.88,
  1569.26

  "So, uh, well, it looks like 1380 if we were absolutely wrong according to whatever jerk wrote this quiz.",
  1569.78,
  1576.14

 [
  "So, I don't know how that shows up on the user interface if it's like shocking red like, oh no, but, uh, D was the actual correct answer here.",

  "So this one we had a little bit more of a spread and, ah, interesting, here the actual correct answer does show up quite a bit- quite a bit lower than- and now I'm questioning myself to make sure that I've actually, um, written the thing appropriately.",
  1595.26,
  1609.64

  "So just as a reminder of what the question is, we're choosing two random numbers from the range zero through one, each according to a uniform distribution, and we're- we're guessing what the probability that they round down- the ratio of these numbers rounds down to an even number.",

  1628.18,
  1638.4
 ],
 [
  "But I think, um, with a- with a little bit of progress on our way, even before we get the exact solution, we can get to a point where you might be able to intuitively give some kind of ballpark estimate.",
