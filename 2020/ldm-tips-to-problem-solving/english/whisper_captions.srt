00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Welcome back, everybody. It's hard to define exactly what mathematicians mean when they use the phrase problem solving.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,500
However you go about it, it's going to involve some notion of approaching puzzles that you've never seen before

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,760
and still being able to systematically and creatively find some solution to them.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,520
But that's a weird thing when you think about it because it makes it a very hard thing to teach.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,660
I mean, you can teach someone how to solve one particular problem, maybe even a class of problems, and teach them how to solve another problem.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,220
But how do you teach someone how to approach a problem that they've never seen before and still make progress on it?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,360
Well, I honestly don't know how, but what I want to do for this lecture is to talk through a couple different problem solving principles.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,120
I've enumerated nine of them in total, and each one we're going to walk through in the context of a specific example.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,400
And I think each one is kind of simple. You'll look at it and you'll nod along thinking,

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,540
yeah, yeah, of course, that's a thing that you should do.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,640
But I would argue that each one is deceptively simple, that you would be shocked at how often you can make very meaningful progress

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,820
in very hard problems just by keeping some of these tips in the back of your mind.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
And to give you a little flavor for where we're going to be going today,

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,380
I want to ask, not as a quiz that I expect you to necessarily be able to solve here on the spot,

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,240
I want to ask you a question that we will be solving later on in the lecture,

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,560
just so you can have it in the back of your mind, a little thing to mull over,

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,060
and a hard problem that will be fun to tackle when the time comes.

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,180
So the question asks, suppose the two numbers are chosen at random from the range 0 through 1,

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,640
and it's done according to a uniform distribution. So maybe you pick like 0.385 and 0.58962 or something like that.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,000
Each one is chosen at random. Suppose p is the probability that the ratio of the first number to the second rounds down to an even number.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,320
So, you know, maybe it rounds down to 0 or it rounds down to 2 or to 4.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
And basically it's asking you to guess where is this probability, you know?

23
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,480
We'll solve it exactly, we'll get an exact expression.

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,380
But just intuitively as you hear the problem and you think of choosing two random numbers between 0 and 1, looking at their ratio,

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,580
what do you think that probability is going to be?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
We'll return back to this later. And one thing I want to say is that this whole live quizzing software,

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,680
it's something that's being built by some friends of mine, Ben Eater, who many of you may know because of his YouTube fame,

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,560
and then another person who used to work with us at Khan Academy named Cam Christensen.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,380
And this is just one small little outcropping of what's actually a much deeper product at play.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,520
And I want to give you a little preview of some of the other things that they've been working on that we'll be developing.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,200
So if any of you want to share some of the lectures here or go back and kind of go through the live quizzing experience,

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,160
if you go to the link that it's in the description, but it's at itempool.com slash c slash 3b1b, but you can follow the description.

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,960
You can basically watch the lectures in a way where you can do these live quizzes

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,200
along with it and your progress is tracked and you get scores and things like that.

35
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,960
So as you skip ahead to various different questions, it will skip you to the right point in the video.

36
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,120
And as the video plays forward, you'll also get to,

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,400
yeah, there's just me talking through some problem, you'll also get to whatever the appropriate part of the problem is.

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,880
They often have explanations associated with them and hints and things like that.

39
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,840
And ultimately, if you look back in just a couple days, I'm going to fill out like homework and challenge problems.

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,140
So if you like challenging problem solving, contest math type stuff, I'm going to put things that are relevant to the lectures in there,

41
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,460
which I think should be fun.

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,540
It's not quite there yet, but definitely check back.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,820
And I'm sure just over the next couple months there will be more item pool shenanigans going on.

44
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,920
If any of you want to use this, maybe to do some live polling in your own

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,960
live classes for teachers who are dealing with the whole remote landscape.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Or if you have your own streams, anything like that. They are looking for beta users, so feel free to reach out to them.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,700
It should be available on the website.

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,700
Now let's dive into the actual content, shall we? Some of the nine deceptively simple problem solving tricks. And before we do, I want to specify

49
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,520
that at some point today, in the next hour, I'm going to purposefully make a mistake.

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,820
Okay, and I tell you that for two reasons. One, so that you keep your eye out and you, you know,

51
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,280
you're a little bit skeptical of each of the claims that I make. And two, so that when I make that mistake and you notice it,

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,560
and you're just, you know, throwing things at the screen, you're getting angry, you're clicking that unsubscribe button,

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,360
you can at least quell a little bit of what you're thinking. So just keep that in mind.

54
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,360
There will be one very purposeful mistake. Now before we get to the problem solving tip, I want to talk about geometry.

55
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,800
This is one thing I was hoping to do a little bit more of in this series,

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,420
but this would be just a fun time to give a little example of it.

57
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,580
And in particular, I want to talk about one of my favorite little bits of geometry.

58
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,460
It's not too simple, but it's also not too hard. It's called the inscribed angle theorem.

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,260
It comes up way more than is reasonable for a simple little theorem like this to actually come up when you're solving problems.

60
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay.

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,160
And basically an inscribed angle of a circle refers to if you have two lines that meet at a point of that circle,

62
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,900
and what we care about is this little angle in here.

63
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,500
Okay.

64
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,140
And if you were just studying this, if you're an early mathematician trying to make sense out of this,

65
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,840
you might make a guess that something about this angle is going to be related to the arc of the circle

66
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,500
that those lines hit.

67
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,420
I mean that arc can also be described as an angle of some kind if we draw lines

68
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,920
from the center of the circle, it makes it a little bit clearer.

69
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,300
So I'm just going to draw a couple green lines here

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,100
and mark that we have a different angle here.

71
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,880
And maybe I give them names. I'll call this one

72
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,980
theta L for like the large angle, and this one I'm going to call theta S.

73
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,560
It's the small angle. And you might wonder is there a relationship between these two angles? And if so, what is it?

74
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,060
And for our purposes today, the question is how do you systematically approach a puzzle like this? Find a relationship between these two

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,360
and prove, prove its existence.

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,660
So problem solving tip, not problem sip,

77
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,280
problem solving tip number one, which is just,

78
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,940
just so useful in a way that again is kind of deceptively simple.

79
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,680
Make sure you're always using the defining features of whatever your setup is.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,240
I swear a good 70% of the problem sets that I did as an undergraduate math major

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,980
essentially came down to looking at what was given, asking very critically

82
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,340
what is the definition of each term involved here, unraveling those definitions, and then just seeing how they piece together.

83
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,020
So use whatever's the defining feature. In our context,

84
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,580
what is defining the various points and intersections that we have here?

85
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,160
Well, it's the idea that they're on a circle. A circle is by definition all of the points that are a common distance from the center.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,540
So in particular, we know that this length is a radius of the circle and this length is a radius of the circle.

87
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,360
We should use the fact that those are the same. But moreover this other point P, that was not just chosen at random,

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,620
it's defined to be on the circle.

89
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,140
And unraveling what that means, it means it is a common distance away

90
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,340
and is the same distance away from the center as these other points.

91
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,200
So I

92
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,380
am then inspired to draw a line to add something to the picture and to note that it's the same there.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,380
You know quite often when you see people solve hard geometry problems,

94
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,200
it comes down to adding something to the picture. And the most beautiful geometry involves adding something that seems out of left field and it

95
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,840
just illuminates everything, you shift your perspective. And sometimes you look at it and you wonder like,

96
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,360
how would you have known what to add? Like again, I'm supposed to draw an extra circle here or

97
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,380
put a, you know, put a rectangle around this triangle, whatever it is you're doing.

98
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,200
But how do you, how do you systematically know what you should add?

99
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,040
So in this context, if it relates to the definition of your objects, probably a good idea. And that line actually will be helpful to us.

100
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
We can start giving a couple things names.

101
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,880
That's something that again, maybe it shouldn't even be described as a tip,

102
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,680
but I've put it down as number two, that when you give things meaningful names, that actually helps you move forward

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,620
in your problem.

104
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,040
And in this context, it might seem like an innocuous thing. I'll call this little angle that we formed with our radius alpha

105
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,160
and this little angle beta.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
And just to see if that

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,040
helps us move forward, you know, recognizing if alpha and beta show up elsewhere, rather than me telling you, I would like you to tell me

108
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,180
in the context of our next quiz question. So before I answer that probability one for you, I'm going to pull up

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,140
question number two for today. We've got a diagram, essentially what we just drew.

110
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,780
The dot in the middle is the center of the circle and I've labeled seven different angles.

111
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,380
I've just labeled them a through g. And what I want you to do is tell me which of these equations is true.

112
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,660
One possibility is that

113
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,460
four of the angles a, b, d, and e

114
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,100
have a sum that's the same as c plus f plus g.

115
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,920
Which, just looking at c, f, and g, that would be 360 degrees, right?

116
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,840
The other is that a is equal to b and d is equal to e.

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,180
Another possibility is that c is equal to f.

118
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,940
And then maybe it's all of those or maybe it's none of those.

119
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,040
And it looks like we already have strong strong consensus on this one with 360, 400, just a strong

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,100
large number of people coming in

121
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,420
agreeing what they believe the right answer is.

122
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,840
And you know, if you if you want to be involved, the place to go, 3b1b.co

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,460
live, that redirects you to an item pool page so that you can follow along. And for those who are watching in the future,

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,320
maybe you're watching it in the embedded page where the problem is just sitting right below you. And even if you're not technically

125
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,740
participating in the data contributing to the live statistics,

126
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,100
when I was going through it, it's honestly pretty fun to just kind of click and like, oh,

127
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,600
I know I'm not a part of this, but it kind of feels like I am a part of what was happening.

128
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,880
So I just love it.

129
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,080
All right, so because there's such strong consensus, I feel comfortable grading this. Oh, I thought I got it right on 1 1 1 1.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
So the correct answer is that a is equal to b, d is equal to e,

131
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,000
and then none of the others are necessarily true.

132
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,320
And let's walk through why that's the case, okay?

133
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,980
It comes down to exactly what we just highlighted, that these radii are common, which means, you know,

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
let me just give more things names. Let's call this point a,

135
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,680
and this point b.

136
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,460
Maybe that's confusing because I was just naming angles a and b, but separate context, separate picture, you know what I mean.

137
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:14,200
The triangle a, p, and then the center of the circle, that's isosceles. You know, there's this symmetry about,

138
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,400
I could even draw the little axis of symmetry,

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,780
and that tells us that this is also alpha. Likewise,

140
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,480
the triangle up here is isosceles, and that tells us that this has an angle of beta.

141
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,040
And what we just did, in effect, is leverage a little bit of symmetry. In this case, it was innocuous,

142
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,200
but quite often looking for symmetry in much harder setups, it's super generalizable and it definitely will

143
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,040
help you move forward. If you recognize that there's something symmetric, use that symmetry in some way,

144
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
which is effectively what we've just done.

145
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,300
Giving things a couple more names, I might want to call this angle,

146
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,060
I'll call it something related to the alphas, so maybe I just call it alpha prime,

147
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,540
and similarly this angle over here is beta prime.

148
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,940
And by noting those facts, I have everything I need to do to draw a connection between

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,180
this small angle and this large angle.

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,480
You essentially just write down the facts that we have based on the triangles we're looking at.

151
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,020
So the triangle with all of the alpha angles, the sum of those angles has to be 180 degrees,

152
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,700
and there's two different alphas in there, and then there's an alpha prime,

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,520
and instead of writing 180 degrees, of course we like radians, so I'm going to say that equals pi radians.

154
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,800
Similarly, the one with all of the betas tells us that if we take 2 times beta and we add beta prime,

155
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,280
that's also pi.

156
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,620
And then the other fact that we have that's just popping right out from the image

157
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,380
is that alpha prime, beta prime, and theta L add up to 360 degrees, or 2 pi.

158
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,340
So just writing down all of the relevant facts that we have,

159
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,360
now we have some objects that we can manipulate and work with to draw some kind of conclusion, which again,

160
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,160
we're looking for a connection between theta small and theta large. And I know a lot of you,

161
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,260
your 3Blue and Brown audience members, you know about the inscribed angle theorem,

162
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,760
but I really want you to think about this from a beginner's mind, right?

163
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,780
If you were just approaching this and you didn't necessarily already know about it,

164
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,120
what would you have done to find that solution, and what principles can you take away as you do that?

165
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,280
Because that helps us as we start to get to harder and harder geometry setups.

166
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,060
So in this context, once I have these three equations,

167
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,340
recognizing that there's an alpha prime here and one here, there's a beta prime here and one here, I might think about canceling them out.

168
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,420
So I'm gonna, you know, add this top equation and maybe I subtract off the other two equations.

169
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,140
And to subtract these off, and what that means is the alpha prime gets cancelled, so does the beta prime, I'm left with

170
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,500
my large angle,

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,060
I'm subtracting off 2 times

172
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,640
alpha plus beta.

173
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,220
You know, each of those gets subtracted off with the coefficient 2. And then we have 2 pi minus 2 copies of pi,

174
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,460
so that's all equal to 0, which is saying the same thing

175
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,160
as theta L is equal to 2 times, well rather than writing alpha plus beta,

176
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,280
I'll just recognize that that is the small little angle that we had.

177
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,380
It's 2 times the small angle.

178
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,520
Again, I can't emphasize enough just what a weirdly useful fact this turns out to be in various geometry puzzles you might do.

179
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,640
It's definitely come up on the channel a number of times in circumstances regarding,

180
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,820
you know, complex numbers or pure geometry situations, of course.

181
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:18,880
Just

182
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,680
anytime you want to relate an angle to 2 times that angle,

183
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,180
realizing them in the context of a circle like this

184
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,520
can be strangely useful. So this is just an image to have burned in your mind as you're solving problems.

185
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,720
And to give you one example of a problem that you can solve once this is sitting there, burned in the back of your mind,

186
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,100
I want you to remember back to the lecture that we did on trigonometry,

187
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,460
which conveniently is actually the example that I had pulled up here.

188
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,000
So one of the central things we were talking about was how

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,260
just playing with graphs you can get this bizarre looking fact that if you square the cosine function,

190
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,580
you get something that looks again just like a cosine graph.

191
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,400
And you can get more exact about that where if we start with an initial cosine graph and you manipulate it a little, you know,

192
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,100
we shift it up, we scale it down, we say we need to double the frequency, you get the exact same graph.

193
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,460
So we have two different expressions for the same thing, but it's not at all obvious why these would be related.

194
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,800
One of them involves doubling the angle it's a reference to, the other involves squaring the output.

195
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,600
Okay, so it's a not obvious fact. We proved it using complex numbers,

196
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:28,320
but what I'd like to do is try to prove this using geometry to kind of viscerally see the fact pop out right in front of us.

197
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,780
And to do that,

198
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,360
let's go ahead and write down what the fact is again so that we can start thinking about it.

199
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
We want to find that the cosine squared of theta,

200
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,360
which is just saying take the cosine of theta and square it, it's that awkward notation,

201
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,500
is equal to one half

202
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,780
of

203
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,360
one plus

204
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:56,880
cosine of two theta. You've got the strained relationship between squaring things and doubling the angle, which as we've talked about in the whole series is

205
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,080
really a reflection of the fact that a cosine is a shadow of an exponential function.

206
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,540
But let's say you didn't know that, we want to see it viscerally and geometrically,

207
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,620
so you don't already know the double angle identities or anything like that. You just want a very direct understanding of this particular equation.

208
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,060
Well, one common thing that comes up

209
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,100
is that a way to show the two non-obvious things are related or even equal

210
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,640
is to see if you can find one object that you can describe in two different ways.

211
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,240
So we're going to look for one object that we have two different descriptions of,

212
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,240
and this often can give you nice equations in this context. It might mean

213
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,200
relating the left and right hand side.

214
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,480
This comes up in combinatorics all the time when you have a counting puzzle where, you know, you do something like

215
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,920
count how many ways you can have a string of five bits that are either zeros or ones,

216
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,600
and on the one hand you can count it multiplicatively kind of going through each one and saying well you're multiplying the possibilities by two.

217
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,900
But on the other hand you can go iteratively and say well how many of them have no ones?

218
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,060
How many of them have one one, two ones? Something that kind of seems harder and a more awkward way to count.

219
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,940
But by describing the same thing twice you end up with this really not obvious fact from an algebraic standpoint.

220
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,460
And we're going to do the same thing more geometrically here. But again, just got to emphasize how like how general this ends up being.

221
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,080
So what we want is some kind of object that each of these describes.

222
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,980
And to do that, maybe we just think okay, let's

223
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,140
let's draw a unit circle,

224
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,440
which is where something like a cosine typically comes up.

225
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,160
Oh, for the first time in my life I drew a quarter circle arc that wasn't terrible. It's not great,

226
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,000
but usually that comes out much more disastrous.

227
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,800
How pleasing.

228
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,940
I should not be so pleased with a terrible quarter circle.

229
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:47,140
Great, okay. So that's our angle theta, right? And what does cosine mean in this context? Not cosine squared, but just plain vanilla cosine.

230
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,760
Well, it tells us if we look at the x-coordinate of this point,

231
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,280
that's the cosine of our angle.

232
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,460
And so now I want you to think about how can we represent the square of the cosine as some kind of object?

233
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,020
Some geometric thing that we can point to in this image.

234
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,720
And the first instinct might be something like, well, let's draw a square off the side of this, you know, something

235
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,520
with area to it and interpret it like that.

236
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,080
But then there's going to be a problem if the principle that we're trying to apply is describing the same object in two different ways.

237
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,700
Because if we describe this left-hand side as some kind of area,

238
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,460
that would mean that we have to find another description of that same area, that same object, with the right-hand side.

239
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,220
But that's going to be weird, because this doesn't involve squaring or anything like that.

240
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,360
If it's just a plain vanilla cosine term, it seems much more natural to describe that as some kind of ratio, or maybe some kind of length.

241
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,260
It's just that we need the 2 theta to pop up somehow.

242
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,860
So instead, let's seek a way to describe cosine squared that does not involve area,

243
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,140
but is instead something more of the flavor of a ratio or a length.

244
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,840
And in this context, the key comes down to leveraging symmetry again. And it's a sneaky bit of symmetry.

245
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,680
It's something we did talk about in the trig lecture, but I love it so much I'll talk about it again.

246
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,760
If we think of this angle theta, on the one hand it's telling us the angle between the x-axis and the line,

247
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,080
but on the other hand it's also telling us the angle between the line and the x-axis. And I know that sounds like the same thing,

248
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,780
but it means when I say project down the point at the end of our radius, which was length 1,

249
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,980
perpendicularly onto the x-axis,

250
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,300
that length got scaled down by cosine theta.

251
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,860
But now what if I do things the other way? What if I say I want to project down

252
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,080
in a perpendicular fashion

253
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,700
onto this line? Well again, I just have two lines separated by an angle theta,

254
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm doing a projection, which means it gets scaled down by the cosine of that angle.

255
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,380
So now I'm taking the cosine of theta scaled down by the cosine of theta, and it gets me cosine squared of theta.

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So cosine squared refers to this length,

257
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,560
a portion of the hypotenuse of our right triangle,

258
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,520
if that hypotenuse had a length of 1, which in our unit circle it always does.

259
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,640
And incidentally, you can show very similar reasoning that the sine of theta is this other

260
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,740
other portion of that hypotenuse, and this gives you a nice,

261
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,680
sort of a clever proof of the Pythagorean theorem, the idea of double projecting

262
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,660
based on asking, you know, is this line theta degrees away from that, or is that line theta degrees away from this?

263
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,840
Sounds like you're saying the same thing, but it gets you something of mathematical substance to recognize that symmetry.

264
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,460
Now, why do I say this? Well, we have a representation of cosine squared. What we want now is to do something in terms of 2 theta.

265
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,820
We just were thinking about a context where we're able to relate an angle to 2 theta, to 2 times that angle.

266
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,880
So somehow we want to realize this angle as an inscribed angle of some kind of triangle.

267
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,840
And I'll show you how you can do that.

268
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,160
But before I do, just to mention another fact that if you've been puzzling around with these sorts of things,

269
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
might be burning in your mind,

270
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,360
is

271
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,740
a specific instance of the inscribed angle theorem called Thales theorem.

272
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,660
So let's say that that large angle we had, 2 theta, was actually 180 degrees, right? It was pi radians.

273
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,900
What would that mean in terms of the inscribed angle theorem?

274
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,280
It means that if we take that diameter of the circle, if it's 180 degrees, it's just drawing out a diameter,

275
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,360
and we have an inscribed angle

276
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,100
with lines that hit either end of that diameter,

277
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,040
then this angle is necessarily half of that.

278
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,080
So what it means is that we can put a right triangle inside a circle, and whenever you do that,

279
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,020
the hypotenuse of the right triangle is exactly the diameter of that circle. It's a very cute fact.

280
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,840
If you wanted another proof of it, that's not just via

281
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,780
the inscribed angle theorem, there's another very wonderful leveraging of symmetry that you can do, where basically you take this point and you say,

282
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to reflect it through the origin,

283
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,800
reflect it through the center of my circle, and see where I get.

284
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,900
And recognize that reflecting through the center is the same as rotating the whole image 90 degrees.

285
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,660
So if I rotated the image, not 90, 180 degrees,

286
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,780
my other vertex would end up at that same point.

287
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,040
But now what we have is a quadrilateral, and one of the diagonals is the diameter of the circle,

288
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,020
but the other diagonal is also diameter of the circle, which in particular means they have the same midpoint and they're the same distance apart,

289
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:19,980
and

290
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,580
you can convince yourself a little that implies it must be a rectangle, that could also be a little side homework problem if you wanted to

291
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,120
chase around the relevant angles.

292
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,020
But I think that's a very beautiful way to think about Thale's theorem, that you reflect everything 180 degrees,

293
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,320
and you necessarily conclude it must be a rectangle, which means that this is a right angle.

294
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,560
Now for our purposes, what does that mean? Well, we've got a right triangle sitting here that's from zero,

295
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,180
we've got one of the points here, another point on the circle. Let's inscribe that in a separate circle, okay?

296
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,080
So I'm going to take a copy of that triangle, but I'm going to,

297
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,240
instead of making the hypotenuse a radius of the circle, I'm going to make that hypotenuse

298
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,440
a diameter of the circle.

299
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,860
So this is still going to be an angle of theta,

300
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,480
sitting right here.

301
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,200
The, uh, basically I flipped it around, so previously it was here, but I flipped it around so that my 90 degree angle is sitting up

302
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,660
and to the right, rather than sitting down here.

303
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,080
The length that we care about is what happens when we project from the point at that 90 degree angle

304
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,580
in a perpendicular fashion down onto the hypotenuse,

305
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,500
which now looks like this.

306
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,160
And what we care about is this

307
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,240
long length, okay?

308
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,700
And actually, let me ask you as a live quiz,

309
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,560
to see if you can come up with an expression for that length in the context of the diagram that we're now looking at.

310
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,840
So, pulling up our quiz again, congratulations to everyone who got this one correct.

311
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,920
Let me give you a little bit of time to think about this one, because this is, uh, this is kind of a heart,

312
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,300
part of the heart of

313
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,020
this particular proof, and I think it's very, very pleasing to see.

314
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,340
So it specifies that the hypotenuse of the large right triangle above has a length of one.

315
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,800
Our context is because it came from the hypotenuse of the triangle drawn in a unit circle,

316
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,040
so the hypotenuse has a length of one. What is the length l

317
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,800
in terms of theta? Okay, so can you find an expression for l in terms of theta?

318
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,480
And I'll give you a little bit of, uh, a little bit of time for that,

319
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,660
bring back our pause and ponder music, get myself a chance to take a drink.

320
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:49,900
So,

321
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,280
once again, it looks like we have some strong consensus for today.

322
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,760
So while answers are rolling in, before I grade it,

323
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,580
I'm just going to go ahead and start describing how it goes, since it seems like a lot of you are already well ahead of me.

324
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,020
It's fun to have though.

325
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,380
So of course, we're going to use the inscribed angle theorem. That is the whole reason

326
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm bringing it up here. It's a way to relate a single angle to twice that angle.

327
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,360
So in this context, I would draw some lines from the center

328
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,000
of my,

329
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,080
uh, of my new smaller circle that has radius only one half,

330
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
and recognize that this is 2 theta.

331
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,480
And this is just lovely now, isn't it? Because what is the length we care about?

332
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,140
Part of it, excuse me, part of it is the radius,

333
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,060
which is one half,

334
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,620
but then

335
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,620
the projection down according to 2 theta onto this remaining leg

336
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,760
ends up being that radius one half times the cosine of 2 theta.

337
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,780
And of course, that's exactly what we want it to be.

338
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,620
We've got the whole radius, which is one half, and then we're multiplying that by 1 plus the cosine of 2 theta.

339
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,100
It's a radius of the circle times a scaled down version of that radius.

340
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,040
So that's two different ways of viewing the same object,

341
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,740
which is what we get when we take this right triangle and we project down and look at

342
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,040
what part of the hypotenuse that cuts off. And it gives us this non-trivial relationship in trigonometry between

343
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,240
the cosine squared and the cosine of 2 theta. The fact that otherwise we were going into like complex numbers and

344
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,420
exponentials to understand. So I think that's quite beautiful. I think that's just, um,

345
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,360
one of the many many instances of where the inscribed angle theorem suspiciously

346
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,720
slos- suspiciously shows up.

347
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,400
Um,

348
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,940
and again, what I want you to take away is this principle that if you can have one object described in two different ways,

349
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:38,640
very powerful in terms of showing non-obvious, um, algebraic relations or anything that's kind of written down symbolically without immediate intuition on top of it.

350
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:44,320
So with all of that, let's actually turn to the probability question that I asked at the beginning of the lecture.

351
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,040
So going back to our live quiz,

352
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,760
uh,

353
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:59,180
I will go ahead and grade what we- we all know know the correct answer. So for those of you- wait a minute.

354
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,840
Oh, it was marked incorrectly. Oh, that's my bad.

355
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,880
No, I just slipped this one in like last minute before the lesson today.

356
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,540
Um, so I might have like swapped around what the answers were. So, uh,

357
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,140
well, it looks like 1380 if we were absolutely wrong according to whatever jerk wrote this quiz.

358
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,760
So,

359
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,660
I don't know how that shows up on the user interface if it's like shocking red like, oh no, but, uh,

360
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,720
D was the actual correct answer here. So congratulations to those of you who got that. Now back to our probability question.

361
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,960
I'm curious to see what people

362
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,480
said on this one just in terms of their instincts. So this one we had a little bit more of a spread and,

363
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,220
ah, interesting, here the actual correct answer does show up quite a bit- quite a bit lower than- and

364
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,020
now I'm questioning myself to make sure that I've actually, um,

365
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,640
written the thing appropriately.

366
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,700
So just as a reminder of what the question is, we're choosing two random numbers from the range zero through one,

367
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,560
each according to a uniform distribution,

368
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,660
and we're- we're guessing what the probability that they round down-

369
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,340
the ratio of these numbers rounds down to an even number. Remember zero is an even number,

370
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,540
so that it rounds down to zero or two or four or anything like that.

371
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:14,420
Now this is a tricky problem to think about and, uh, definitely no- no fault at all for, uh,

372
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,400
anyone who isn't immediately able to see roughly where it should be.

373
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,820
But I think, um, with a- with a little bit of progress on our way, even before we get the exact solution,

374
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,560
we can get to a point where you might be able to

375
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,040
intuitively give some kind of ballpark estimate.

376
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,820
So what have we got here?

377
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,240
Choosing two random numbers between zero and one. I think that's a weird thing to think about,

378
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,380
um, especially if you're not familiar with probability that well or when the phrase uniform distribution is thrown up if it's not clear what that means.

379
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,340
Um, but essentially,

380
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,440
uh, it's what you would expect where you're choosing some random point on this line,

381
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,520
and the idea is that each point is as likely as another, or more specifically a given range of points of a certain size,

382
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,560
should have a given probability that's independent of where that range showed up. It's only dependent on its size.

383
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,680
You know, so you might have in the back of your mind the idea that we've chosen two points,

384
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,180
they're each somewhere between zero and one. And

385
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,860
just to give an example of what we mean by uniform distribution, the probability that x sits between

386
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,420
0.3 and like 0.5.

387
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,820
Because it's going to be somewhere between zero and one, and the length of that range is 0.2, about a fifth of

388
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,620
the entire length it could have come from. What it means to be uniform is that

389
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,780
that probability is actually just the length of the segment that it came from.

390
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,220
Now, one thing you might ask is, well, what if, what about the probability that it's precisely 0.3 or precisely 0.5?

391
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,480
Would it matter if we made these less than or equal to signs?

392
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,780
And the answer is it doesn't actually matter, because the probability of hitting any specific value on a real number line ends up being zero.

393
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,180
This is a thing many find very confusing. How can a probability of an event that's possible,

394
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,960
it's definitely possible to hit 0.3, have probability zero? Made a whole video about it trying to describe this,

395
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,020
but really what it comes down to is that the things that have probability, you should think of ranges.

396
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:13,440
Those are the fundamental objects, and it doesn't really matter how we treat the boundary and just think in terms of ranges.

397
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,660
Even still though, what we're asking is a very bizarre question, which is

398
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,460
if we take the ratio of x and y

399
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:29,260
and we round that down, which sometimes, you know, mathematicians write using this floor function, saying we find the greatest integer smaller than that,

400
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,380
how do we know if that's an even number? That's a weird thing to think about, it's a hard problem in that way.

401
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,240
So, you know, if you think through the principles here,

402
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,320
it's kind of like use the defining features of the setup.

403
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,720
Well, not clear how to use the fact that it's a uniform distribution. I guess we'll be using lengths in some way

404
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,940
to yield probabilities, so maybe that gives us some geometry, but that's not really helpful. Give things meaningful names,

405
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,940
you know, maybe x and y are meaningful or some something suggestive like that. Symmetry, okay, maybe,

406
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,900
you know, the idea that choosing x and then y is as likely as choosing y than x, you could use that to conclude that

407
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,560
this ratio x over y is as likely to be above one as it is to be below one.

408
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,580
And that actually does tell you something, because if we're wondering how often do you round down to be zero,

409
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,740
right, you can say well x over y is as likely to be,

410
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,680
x is as likely to be bigger than y as y is likely to be bigger than x.

411
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,420
So there's a 50-50 chance that this should happen.

412
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,020
This would be

413
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:26,960
a

414
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
probability of 50 percent.

415
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,400
So that gets you somewhere, which is kind of nice, but it's not clear how you would apply that to things like even numbers,

416
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,520
same object, two different ways, unclear.

417
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,060
So principle number five here

418
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,280
is where we're going to come in.

419
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,280
Again, it seems simple. It's something that you can not be like, yeah, yeah, drawing pictures,

420
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,620
it helps to think through what I'm looking at. But really, when you find yourself struggling with some setup

421
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,720
that's not already visual or pictorial, you know, it doesn't have to be making a geometric,

422
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,560
but just having some kind of sketch, uh, to

423
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,520
give meaning to your terms can be very helpful. And as a more specific problem solving tip, when you have some numbers,

424
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,760
multiple different numbers, see if you can make them coordinates in some space.

425
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,760
So rather than thinking about x and y as separate things here, we'll want to think about a single point with xy coordinates.

426
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,740
And what that does for us is it actually turns the whole problem two-dimensional in a very helpful way.

427
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,760
So first of all, I've lost track of my straight edge,

428
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,960
which, where have you gone little straight edge? I can only throw you so far. Oh, here we go.

429
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,060
Things, they run away from you.

430
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,620
Even your objects sometimes get tired of math class and want to play truant now and then,

431
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,680
but he has to stay

432
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,800
whether he likes to or not.

433
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,140
Absurd.

434
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,000
So

435
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,040
let's say this is our x coordinate.

436
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,920
x can fall anywhere between 0 and 1 with uniform probability.

437
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,380
y can fall between 0 and 1. So when we have a pair of numbers, you know, something like 0.2,

438
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,520
what is that, maybe like 0.8,

439
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,740
pair of numbers, it's just a single point in this diagram.

440
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,880
And now to choose both of those numbers uniformly at random means that we're choosing a random point inside a square,

441
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,900
a square with side length 1.

442
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,460
And now maybe we can make a little bit of progress,

443
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,440
because it's going to come down to some view of what's going on in this square.

444
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,380
Now with this specific example, if we're thinking about the ratio x over y,

445
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,260
and taking its floor, taking, just rounding it down,

446
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,580
well, that's 0.2 over 0.8, that's going to round down to 0, so this would end up being even.

447
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,000
And like I just said, that that happens with 50% probability.

448
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,020
But let's see if we can try to find a way of thinking about that that generalizes up to other examples.

449
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,560
And again, one very useful thing, if you get stuck,

450
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,860
that I have enumerated down here as principle number six,

451
00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:00,240
is to ask a simpler variant of the problem. You're solving something, it's hard. It's too hard.

452
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,080
See if you can make it simpler in a way that you actually can solve and get some kind of foothold.

453
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,040
Maybe that means loosening the constraints of the problem in some setups, or maybe it means looking at a sub-problem.

454
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,800
So in our context, rather than asking the probability that it rounds down to be even, let me just ask the probability that it

455
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,340
becomes one, but I want you to answer it in a geometric way, something that will

456
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,060
generalize to rounding to other things, because the next simpler question might be probability that it rounds down to two, and things like that.

457
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,160
You know where this is going to go. We're going to do it as a live quiz because

458
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,860
rather than me answering things, I want you guys to answer things for me.

459
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,060
So jumping up to question number four at this point,

460
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,760
it's going to give us a couple different diagrams.

461
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:48,800
Okay, we've got a, b, c, and d, and it's asking us which of these four regions corresponds to values of x and y,

462
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,280
where taking the floor of x divided by y is equal to zero,

463
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,920
which is to say you take the ratio, you round it down, you get zero. Which region corresponds to that fact?

464
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,220
So,

465
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,160
okay, I'm going to go ahead and lock in answers, but if you want to keep thinking about it,

466
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,500
definitely feel free to pause the video and do so. I don't want to rush anyone.

467
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,680
So it looks like

468
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,480
1265 of you,

469
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:55,620
1273, always answers rolling in at the end, correctly answered that it's c. And let's take a moment to think about why that's the case.

470
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,680
Okay, you can do so just with a pile of examples and just see which one seemed to fall in the region or not,

471
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,340
but let's see if we can understand this in a way that

472
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,080
lets us make progress onto the other even numbers.

473
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,200
So when we say that it rounds down to zero, what we're basically saying is that that ratio sits somewhere between zero and one.

474
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,680
And it's awkward to think of x divided by y, we kind of like to think of y in terms of x,

475
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,500
so if I multiply everything by y,

476
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,820
which is okay to do with these inequalities because y is always positive,

477
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,880
so that's not going to affect whether the inequality flips one way or another, I multiply everything by y,

478
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,860
and we're basically asking when is x less than y? And whenever you see an inequality,

479
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:42,300
the boundary of that region is going to be described by the equality. So we're going to wonder when is it the case that y equals x?

480
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,340
Well, that's just a straight line that goes diagonally. If we draw our line y equals x,

481
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,920
that's what we get. Now that's the boundary of our region, and to know whether

482
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,180
we should look to the left of it or to the right of it, either you can think very directly and say, well,

483
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,880
you know, y should be greater than x, so at a given point we want to move upward in the positive y direction.

484
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,680
You could look at a specific example like this, but however you do it, you'll draw the conclusion that

485
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:19,300
geometrically the region of points such that x divided by y rounds down to zero is this sort of grilled cheese cut of our diagram.

486
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,900
So with that,

487
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,000
maybe you can start to think about the harder variant, which is when is it that x divided by y

488
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,540
rounds down to be two?

489
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,600
And again, I don't want to answer it. I want you to answer it.

490
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,960
When is it that x divided by y

491
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,720
inside our unit square of points x comma y

492
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,920
rounds down to two? And we've got four possible

493
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,460
geometric regions that this could correspond to, a, b, c, and d.

494
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,480
And really, you know, rather than just thinking about which of these is it, really try to think through

495
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,020
why it's the case and how you can prove that one of these boundaries is actually what it's supposed to be. For example,

496
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,680
I want it to be the case that if I didn't show the correct answer here,

497
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,660
let's say I was just trolling with everyone and I didn't show the correct answer,

498
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:13,020
you would be able to confidently come and say like, no, I'm quite positive that the correct answer is nothing that you've shown here.

499
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,180
See if that's the level of reasoning that you can put behind it.

500
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,580
So again, I'll give you give you a little moment to think about that.

501
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:51,880
So

502
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:04,980
so

503
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,120
Okay, so once again, I'm going to lock in answers potentially earlier than you want me to, but keep the lesson moving forward.

504
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,800
No hard feelings if things haven't

505
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,760
clicked yet, because hopefully the explanation will make them do so. So the correct answer is c,

506
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,200
which it looks like most of you got, and let's go ahead and think through why that's the case.

507
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,300
Very similar reasoning to what we were just doing. The idea is that rather than thinking about this ratio

508
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,220
and a floor, which is kind of a kind of an awkward thing, let's explicitly write out the inequality this is referring to.

509
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,340
It's saying that x divided by y

510
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,400
is greater than or equal to 2 if it's rounding down to that, but it's not greater than 3, so it's less than 3.

511
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:50,180
And, you know, again, it's a little bit awkward to think of this ratio. So let's write that as 2 times y

512
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,880
is less than or equal to x,

513
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,480
which is less than or equal to 3 times y.

514
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,080
Now quite often we don't think of

515
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,800
y as a function of x, we think of x as a function of y, if that makes you feel more comfortable.

516
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,340
So if you want in the back of your mind, you can kind of think 2y less than or equal to x.

517
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,080
Well, that's the same thing as saying y is less than or equal to x halves. And same deal,

518
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,240
3y

519
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,960
being greater than x, that's the same thing as saying y is greater than x divided by 3.

520
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,280
Because that way we can look at the equalities associated with each of these. The line y equals x halves,

521
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:33,260
which has a slope of one half, you can think of it as intersecting at the point where y equals one half when x equals 1.

522
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,800
Right, so it'll be a line like this that describes part of the boundary of our region.

523
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,780
And the other line is when y is equal to x thirds.

524
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,560
So we know we actually have to be above this line that I'm about to draw,

525
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,300
where one of these represents

526
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,280
x over 2,

527
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,140
and one of these represents

528
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,600
x over 3.

529
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,140
And then part of the

530
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,320
part of the intrusion into the space of my last inequality.

531
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,620
All right, so we want to be above the x equals x over 3 below the x divided by 2.

532
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,440
This region here

533
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,560
shows us everything where rounding down gets to 2. And I want you to appreciate how

534
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,480
this is a kind of complicated thing to think about if we hadn't gone into a picture

535
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,060
that involves two dimensions. If you were just thinking of x and y

536
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,100
varying along this line and wondering when is it the case that x is more than twice,

537
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,080
or y is more than two times what x is. No, yeah, sorry. x is more than two times what y is, but it's not three times

538
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,640
more than what y is.

539
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,140
It's not, not, no, I said it wrong. I said it wrong.

540
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,080
When y is more than two times what x is, but it's not three times more than x is.

541
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,620
It's very easy to get fuddled in that way.

542
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,900
And it's even harder to try to

543
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:52,540
give some sort of probability to that, whereas in our diagram it has a very clear meaning. It is the area of this region

544
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,580
because the full area of possibilities already is one, so

545
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,960
this, the

546
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,380
probability of something happening should be one,

547
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,980
and we just need to look at the area of that. And now maybe you can see where this is going to go,

548
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,260
because for the next term when we want to know

549
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,780
when does x divided by y

550
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,320
sit between

551
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,160
four

552
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,720
and five,

553
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,100
we're going to be drawing lines that intersect at x over four. Maybe I'll go to a different color for this one.

554
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,760
x over four and x over five,

555
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,200
which is going to require very small handwriting at this point, but I'm going to give it a try nevertheless.

556
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,540
x fourths,

557
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,680
y equals x fifths, and this little sliver of area

558
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,860
gives us all of the times that our ratio x over y rounds to be four.

559
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,080
And we're going to have to add infinitely many of these, so that gives us sort of another phase of challenge to the problem.

560
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,540
I've drawn this all out in Desmos, by the way, if you want to just sort of see what some of these regions look like,

561
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,940
where we've got our top region of places where it rounds to zero, then we've got another region

562
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,920
corresponding to rounding to two, rounding to four, rounding to six, and just on and on

563
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,560
each one of these regions.

564
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,040
Rounding and rounding, rounding. I only went out to like a hundred or something like that, but

565
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,800
that gives you a sense of what we're trying to do. So we've made progress, but this is still hard.

566
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,300
What is the area of all of those triangles added together? Right, that's not necessarily an obvious thing.

567
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,280
So

568
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,780
let's just start by writing it out and seeing

569
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,160
what help that can give us. So every one of these is a triangle,

570
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,920
it's going to look like one half base times height.

571
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,980
And in fact every one of them, if we think of the left right direction as being their height,

572
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,860
every one of them has a height of one. So each one is going to look like one half times a base of some kind.

573
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,800
So I'm going to take, maybe I'll write this out on a different piece of paper actually so I can keep it up close.

574
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,520
I'll take one half

575
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,080
times whatever the base of the triangle is times the height. So our first triangle, that base is,

576
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,280
that base has a length one.

577
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,740
So that's going to correspond to the one half probability of going to zero. The next triangle,

578
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,760
we have to look at this length here between one third and one half. What is that length?

579
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,900
Well, actually I'm just going to write it out as

580
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,720
a half minus a third.

581
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,620
It equals a sixth, but writing it out like that kind of reminds us where it came from,

582
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,380
so we don't want to collapse things too soon.

583
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,160
That could maybe be another problem solving tip, don't collapse things too soon. Try to let your notation

584
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,920
have a memory for where things came from because sometimes that helps see overall patterns.

585
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,720
This next one, what's the distance between these two points? Well, it's a fourth minus a fifth.

586
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,320
That's the distance between these given how they were defined. So we have a fourth

587
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,740
minus a fifth.

588
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,500
And in general we have this kind of oscillating sum,

589
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,020
a sixth minus a seventh, where we have all the reciprocals of the natural numbers,

590
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:54,680
but we're adding that up infinitely many different times, okay, and we want to know what that sum happens to be.

591
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,360
And from here,

592
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,380
the problem solving tip associated with this will seem a little bit strange, but

593
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,780
it might be the case that you recognize this fact from somewhere else. You might recognize, let's say if you were watching a particular

594
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,160
lockdown math lecture a week or two ago,

595
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,960
that this alternating sum, one minus a half plus a third minus fourth plus a fifth,

596
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,160
on and on, actually equals the natural log of two.

597
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,680
Okay.

598
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,980
And the way this actually came about, it's such a weird procedure,

599
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,520
it's worth just like walking through again really quickly because it's a bizarre thing that you're not gonna,

600
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,380
you're not gonna be able to just stare at this formula and then immediately see that this is how you're going to solve it,

601
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,260
unless it's something that you've seen before, which can make it seem all the more opaque.

602
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:48,920
We did this strange thing where we made it seem like a harder question at first, where rather than asking about

603
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,740
one particular sum, we turned it into a function, which is effectively asking about infinitely many different sums like this.

604
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,900
So x to the fourth over four,

605
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:05,100
then we're adding x to the fifth over five. And the reason for doing this is that this plays nicely in calculus land,

606
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:12,060
because those denominators are now related to the exponents in a way that we can kind of cancel out by doing an integration trick,

607
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,800
each one of those terms I can nicely express as an integral of a much more simple monomial term.

608
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,280
x cubed

609
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,840
minus,

610
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,280
now let's see, plus

611
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,680
x to the fourth.

612
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,840
If I integrate this thing, each one of them has an exponent that increases and then we divide by what the exponent is.

613
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,860
And the reason that you would want to do this

614
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,780
is that this now has a nice

615
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:44,020
way to collapse itself. So just to make this maybe more explicit, if we evaluate the integral from zero to one,

616
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:49,460
that's the same as taking this whole expression and evaluating it at one and subtracting at zero.

617
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,960
So that will give us what happens when we plug in at one.

618
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,960
And again, this is just such a bizarre thing that

619
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,840
if you hadn't recognized the sum, seeing someone prove it to you like this

620
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,780
doesn't necessarily make it feel like something that you could have found,

621
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,540
which is frustrating in the context of trying to develop problem solving tips that are generalizable.

622
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,920
But I'll keep walking through it just to

623
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,660
give a little bit of closure to this. We've got this infinite sum that if you had been familiar with geometric

624
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,020
sums, where each term looks like a certain product from the last,

625
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,500
you would be able to write this as 1 over 1 plus x, because we're always multiplying by negative x.

626
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,600
So you always take 1 over 1 minus the thing you're multiplying by,

627
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,900
which again, it's kind of one of these things where it's relying on you recognizing it in some way.

628
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,740
And then the last bit of recognition is knowing how to take integrals of 1 divided by

629
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,220
a thing. And in this context it works out very nicely to just be the natural log.

630
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,780
And we're evaluating this between 0 and 1,

631
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,720
which is to say we're taking the natural log of 1 plus 1, or 2,

632
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,580
minus the natural log of 1, which is 0.

633
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,640
And that's why all of these things are the natural log of 2.

634
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,440
And think about what has to go on there

635
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,220
in order to be able to take this and then apply it to our probability question.

636
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,520
You would have to recognize the alternating sum as something that you had seen from another context,

637
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,660
or if you didn't, you would have to be aware of this trick to somehow turn it into a polynomial

638
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,800
that can be nicely expressed as an integral, that can be collapsed because of geometric series,

639
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,340
which can be integrated because of the natural log of x. And then thinking about like, what is

640
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,760
what is the thing that you can teach someone to say come away and be able to solve problems in the same way?

641
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,580
I have what might seem like kind of a facetious tip, but I actually think it's maybe the most potent one and the most honest one.

642
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,940
The way that you can get to this sort of point,

643
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,880
just read a lot. Read as much as you can. You know, watch YouTube videos on math if they're substantive, things like that.

644
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,520
And think a lot about problems,

645
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,460
which is maybe frustrating because what you want is to be able to say like,

646
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,960
well, how could I have come to this on my own without having merely recognized it?

647
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,740
But I think the truth of the matter is a lot of what looks like insight and ingenuity

648
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,500
is really just pattern recognition, but wearing a little bit of added clothing.

649
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,200
And sometimes it's patterns not so much that you're directly recognizing exactly this,

650
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,540
but maybe you had seen a series like this or a tactic like this before.

651
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,700
Like geometric series, that comes up a lot. If you read a lot, and if you think a lot about problems,

652
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,640
you will recognize geometric series,

653
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,680
even if it's in a context that you've never actually seen before, or a specific geometric series that you've never seen before.

654
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,460
Similarly, if you read a lot and you think a lot about calculus,

655
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,960
knowing that you can have the natural log pop out of an integral like this, it becomes second nature.

656
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:33,140
And I think recognizing the truth of this as being the key to a lot of problem solving is actually pretty inspiring.

657
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:41,060
Because oftentimes you find yourself in a situation where somebody is, they're just faster, they're just better, they just recognize things

658
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,940
more so than you do.

659
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,760
And that can be a little bit intimidating, right? To look at one problem, think of yourself as

660
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,180
pretty savvy with math and knowing what's going on, and then just having someone

661
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,600
burn through with a wonderful bit of cleverness, this super beautiful argument,

662
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,500
that leaves you sitting there in the dust wondering like, wow, I just, you know,

663
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:04,240
I'm just not in the same league at all, right? And you sometimes even think, well, he just has a math gene, right? That person,

664
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,240
they just have some sort of innate instinct that makes them really good at this stuff.

665
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,340
But I think the truth of the matter is that the people who are showing that kind of ingenuity,

666
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,600
they've just exposed themselves to a huge number of patterns, and you too could get there, right?

667
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,400
There is a path towards that which takes the form of

668
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,220
practice. But not just practice, practice where you're taking each problem that you're looking at and trying to digest the deeper principles behind it.

669
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,400
Maybe some of the ones I'm trying to talk through today, like, okay, I can say leverage symmetry, but what does that actually mean?

670
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,520
You know, what does it mean to look at a symmetry of a problem and turn that into something that's formulaically useful?

671
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,860
You just have to see it a lot, and then be pensive when you do. Don't just be satisfied with the answer,

672
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,200
see if you can understand why that answer came out.

673
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,120
So in that way, this number seven, like, it's the most frustrating,

674
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,420
but it's the most real of all the problem solving tips that there can be, which is that

675
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,180
true problem solving comes down to a kind of pattern recognition, and there's no two ways around it.

676
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,100
You just have to do a lot of practice and expose yourself to a lot.

677
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,100
Now I would bet that when we did talk about this infinite series a couple lectures back,

678
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,020
you wouldn't have thought that that's a thing that you're going to be using in a probability question one day.

679
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,180
But that's just how these things go. They show up in unexpected places.

680
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,720
So what you can do then,

681
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,040
is say, well, we've got our whole expression that involves this very alternating sum,

682
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,540
and you'd say, okay, that means that the answer to our final question

683
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,500
is, you know, one half of the natural log of two. It's one half of what that alternating sum came out to be,

684
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,740
which is very nice, you know, it involves this natural log expression,

685
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,440
and it's very clean, and we've got this picture for where it came from adding up all of these,

686
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,780
all of these areas.

687
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,100
Now at this point, there is one thing that I think separates

688
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,400
really good problem solvers, the ones who get like nearly perfect scores all the time,

689
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,520
to ones who are like merely good, who, you know, they aren't necessarily perfect scores.

690
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,840
There's some like silly mistakes that come in here or there.

691
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:03,940
At this point, when you've done the problem and you've got your nice elegant solution, you want to draw a box around it, you're not done.

692
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,300
Just always, always, principle number eight here, always gut check your answer.

693
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,660
Okay, because there's going to be some little mistake that happens all the time.

694
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,420
The great problem solvers aren't the ones who just never make little mistakes,

695
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,560
they're the ones who have some way of recognizing what those mistakes are.

696
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,700
So in this context, let's say I,

697
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,980
I just want to see numerically what my answer turns out to be, right?

698
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,700
We said that it was one half times the natural log of two.

699
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,760
So let's just see what does that end up being? And natural log of two is around 0.69,

700
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,760
so maybe it's not too surprising, we're around 0.346, around 0.35, okay?

701
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,800
So if we write that down as one of the,

702
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,380
as the answer that we just got,

703
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,680
I told you I would purposefully make a mistake, so hopefully you're not yelling too loud at this point,

704
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,860
does that make sense? Does that pass a basic reasonability test? And if you look at our picture,

705
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,160
well, the probability has to be at least a half, because that's the region where it rounds down to zero.

706
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,720
So certainly it couldn't be the case that the whole thing adds up to be only 0.35,

707
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,900
so there must have been some mistake we had along the way.

708
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:15,240
Everybody makes silly mistakes, everybody drops a minus sign or applies some rule that doesn't quite apply in a circumstance.

709
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,180
You're not going to make, you're not going to approach perfection by avoiding silly mistakes.

710
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,080
The way to do it is to be able to systematically know when you've,

711
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,400
when you've made them.

712
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,080
So always gut check your answer, have like two different perspectives that can give you a reasonability check.

713
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,220
In this context, if it inspired us to go and look a little bit more carefully at how we were applying things,

714
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,840
this sum isn't quite the alternating sum that converges to natural log of 2.

715
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,060
In particular, we added the 1, but then we also add one half, and it's only after that that we start alternating.

716
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,520
It was plus plus, then minus plus, minus plus, on and on.

717
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,140
And you might see this by recognizing we were subtracting all the even numbers here, but we're subtracting all the odd numbers here.

718
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,220
So it's similar, but it's not the same. We will be able to use our knowledge,

719
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,080
but let me just give this part where things actually start alternating a name, something like s.

720
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,440
What this bottom equation is telling us is that when we take 1 minus s,

721
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,160
so that would mean we're subtracting the one half, then we're adding the one third, then we're subtracting the one fourth,

722
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,720
we're flipping all of the signs of everything beyond that 1,

723
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,140
that is the thing that equals the natural log of 2.

724
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,040
Which in turn implies that

725
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,440
that remainder of the sum looks like 1 minus the natural log of 2.

726
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,540
Okay, so all of that,

727
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,460
what does that tell us? When we plug it into our original expression,

728
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:40,760
it's saying that the actual answer should not be one half the natural log of 2. That didn't even pass our basic reasonability test.

729
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:41,860
Instead,

730
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:47,740
it'll be one half of 1 plus 1 minus the natural log of 2, which is just 2

731
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,380
minus the natural log of 2.

732
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,740
So does that pass our reasonability check? What does this actually equal numerically?

733
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,600
You can get a loose approximation in your head if you want, or if you want to see more precisely, we can pull up a calculator.

734
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:06,400
So if we go over here and we're saying, no, no, no, we don't want the natural log of 2,

735
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:07,880
that was wrong.

736
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,800
2 minus that, maybe 0.653. Does that pass our basic reasonability test?

737
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,720
Yeah, I think so, right? 0.65, that looks like a reasonable

738
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,460
answer to what the area in our diagram was, because if we looked at that diagram, which was,

739
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,760
you know, we've got one wedge here that's covering 0.5, and then this other one covers, well,

740
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,560
about one sixth,

741
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:41,360
half of a sixth, basically, because this length was a half minus a third, which makes it a sixth, and then it's a triangle, so

742
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,480
one half base times height.

743
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,160
So that's about a 12th, or 0.083.

744
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,560
And then the rest of it, you know, it's not going to fill a huge amount. Something around 0.65 seems pretty reasonable.

745
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,020
And so that, you know, we could call that good on our gut check, that this is probably the correct answer.

746
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,400
But we could go one level further if we wanted, because probability questions

747
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,280
very often you can kind of cheat and just see the answer by simulating it,

748
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,760
and actually taking a bunch of samples and seeing what happens.

749
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,300
So I want to do that actually on this one, just to give us a little bit of confidence that our answer of

750
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:21,020
0.65, that there wasn't some other silly mistake that we made along the way, because everyone knows there certainly are silly mistakes that we can make.

751
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,080
Before I jump to the programming, though,

752
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,180
I just want to see if there's any questions from the audience, and it certainly looks like there are.

753
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,880
So let's see if we can address some of these, get myself out of the way of the questions.

754
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,160
This is like from the book The Chosen, where the rabbi makes an intentional mistake in his long speech to test his son.

755
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,960
It is exactly like that, my children. I just want to test you. Every time I make a mistake,

756
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,060
it was always purposeful, and I was always doing it just to test you.

757
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,160
All right, keep making more episodes. Why am I stopping?

758
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,240
Two reasons. You know, the main one, honestly, if I go much longer in this lockdown without getting a haircut,

759
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:02,000
we're going to have to start filming these in the style of like a 1980s music video, just to keep stylistic consistency.

760
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,580
I'm not up for that. You know, I think that's just going to be a little bit too much effort,

761
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,500
so I'll have to wait until whenever it's possible to get a haircut again, then we can go.

762
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,380
Really, though, I also just miss my old content. I love visualizing stuff. I've got a long pile of things

763
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,620
I want to get to, and you know, the lectures take time. I might spin up something like this again,

764
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,000
might do it on a separate channel. We'll see what plays out, but I would love to do like a full course

765
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,480
where it's a little bit more clear exactly what we're going to talk about from beginning to end.

766
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,960
Loosely, I'm thinking like combinatorics would be fun, but don't hold me to that.

767
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:40,740
And lastly, can you help us understand derangements and the principles of inclusion and exclusion, just like combinatorics intuitive? Yeah, boy.

768
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,580
How much time do we have today? Tell you what,

769
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:51,880
maybe just a separate video. If I do the combinatorics course, actually, that would be a perfect example for it.

770
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:58,140
It takes a little bit too much to describe here, but very naturally what you end up with is taking 1

771
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:05,140
over 1 factorial minus 1 over 2 factorial plus 1 over 3 factorial minus, and you're doing this alternating sum with factorials,

772
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,600
which is why e pops out. And if you think of e as fundamentally being the sum of the reciprocals of factorials,

773
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,160
it doesn't seem crazy surprising that it's related to counting problems in that way.

774
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,940
But for another day, I'll say, because I don't know if we have time today.

775
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,080
Because I would love to just show how you could maybe gut check this programmatically if you wanted to,

776
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:30,720
because the very last principle I have for problem solving, for mathematical problem solving, is to learn at least a little bit of programming.

777
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,600
Okay, and the reason here, one, for what we're about to do, you can sometimes

778
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,400
basically cheat and see what an answer is numerically,

779
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,160
to see that that verifies how you're thinking about it analytically. But also,

780
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,480
importantly, it forces you to think about things in two separate ways. Sometimes you can go about it mathematically,

781
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,780
but then when you try to make it computational,

782
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,980
you run into certain walls about like, how are things actually defined? Or, I don't have infinity available to me,

783
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,660
how can I do this in a more approximate way?

784
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,320
Very often when I'm animating things for usual videos, the piece of math that I'm describing,

785
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,640
you know, it lines up with some way that I'm programming it to give the illustrations.

786
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:11,080
And when those mismatch, that's actually what's most interesting, when it's not

787
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,520
computationally viable to give a perfect illustration of what I'm describing.

788
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:19,340
And I actually think that does make for better problem solving in general, where you're coming at it from two different angles.

789
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:25,920
So let's just try this out, see if we can understand the probability question we were just looking at in terms of

790
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,820
just, you know,

791
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,860
what's the word I'm looking for? Cheating! Seeing what it turns out to be. So I'm going to import numpy,

792
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,340
which evidently some heathens refer to as numpy, which just,

793
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,760
I just can't, that seems awful to me.

794
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,060
So we can find random numbers if you just call random,

795
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,820
this first random refers to the library, the second one is a function.

796
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:59,220
It will return a number between 0 and 1 according to a uniform distribution. So it is as likely to choose something between,

797
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,460
you know, 0.1 and 0.2 as it is to choose something between 0.8 and 0.9.

798
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,120
And what's nice is I can get a list of them,

799
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,380
so in this case I get a list of 10 random numbers, and maybe I call that something like x,

800
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,500
and maybe I create another list of y. So x, some random numbers, y, some random numbers,

801
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,740
and if I take x divided by y, it does it term by term.

802
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,840
So for example this first number that we see in here, that's 0.739,

803
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,520
that's taking the 0.52 divided by the 0.7.

804
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,920
This next one is taking 0.66 divided by 0.56 on and on, so we can see all of our ratios like that.

805
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,640
And in general I might

806
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,100
just define a ratios list where I'm going to take my,

807
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,380
a bunch of random numbers

808
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,000
of size n, and then divide it by another bunch of random numbers of the same size.

809
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,400
n is not defined, but I'll give it a definition, some nice and big number like a million.

810
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,060
Okay.

811
00:59:54,740 --> 01:00:01,380
And now I'm holding on to a million ratios, a million examples of x divided by y, where x and y are chosen

812
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:05,040
according to our constraints, which is kind of cool if you think about it.

813
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,640
So, you know, we can see some examples here, some that have come up to zero,

814
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,080
and some that would round down to zero, some that would round down to two, some that would round down to one, so that's nice.

815
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,780
And now I can start asking questions, like, you know, when is it that I take these ratios,

816
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,200
I take the floor function of them, not the four, the floor,

817
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,460
and I want to know when is that equal to zero.

818
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,100
This gives me a list of trues and falses, basically saying it is or it isn't zero, and if I take

819
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:36,940
the mean of that, which is treating the trues and falses as ones and zeros, this tells me the proportion

820
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:43,780
in total that will actually be zeros. So we expect it to be about a half, and we can verify, yeah, okay, it's about a half.

821
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,520
We could have also asked when is it about

822
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,780
two, okay,

823
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:54,980
and it looks like 0.83. And remember from our diagram what we were looking for is when

824
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,160
when it's in this green region here, when it's in that green triangle, which has an area

825
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:06,060
that was a half minus a third, but all times a half, because it's one half base times height for a triangle.

826
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:11,420
So if we pop back over to our terminal and say, okay, if we were looking for

827
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:17,180
one half times the base of that triangle, which was a half minus a third,

828
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,140
we would expect that proportion to have been 0.83. And yeah, it looks like it was about that.

829
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,480
And we could even

830
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,780
answer our actual question, which is to take the floor, and then if I say I want to divide by two

831
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,980
and ask when the remainder is zero, that's a way of asking when it's even,

832
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,740
and then taking that whole list and taking a mean of it is a way of

833
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,180
asking how often

834
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,740
that ends up looking like true, what proportion of them give me true,

835
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:46,300
and yeah, 0.65, which is about the answer that we were looking for. You know, we were looking for something that was too

836
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,820
half of two minus the natural log,

837
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,100
natural log of two.

838
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,880
So we have this wonderful way to kind of empirically verify.

839
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,420
And of course, and most of the times with in-lockdown math that I've pulled up Python, I'm just

840
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:06,500
doing relatively simple things numerically. If you wanted to, you could try to visualize stuff. So something like matplotlib

841
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,380
is definitely a great

842
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:14,260
pyplot. I'll import it as plt. This is a very good library for

843
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,540
just like simple data visualization that you can pull up pretty quickly.

844
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,860
So in our context, I can pull up a histogram.

845
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,560
So I'm going to take a histogram of all of my data,

846
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:30,540
and I have to specify a range. So maybe we just want to look at when the, when those

847
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,520
values get bucketed in between like 0 and 20.

848
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,740
So my number of bins is 20.

849
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:45,220
I was about to sneeze, but I held it in. Don't you love when that happens when like a sneeze is coming and you don't have to catch it?

850
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,800
It just recedes into the darkness because it knows that you're better than the sneeze.

851
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,420
Right. Again, I'm more pleased with myself than I should be there.

852
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:54,680
And um,

853
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:01,020
I always, you always have to add a relative width on these sorts of histograms because they just look ugly if they're all like side by side,

854
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,500
I think sometimes. So if I do this,

855
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,600
um, and then I show what the plot ends up being,

856
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,840
I have something that has shown up on my screen, but not your screen. So let's pop it on over.

857
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,140
Yeah, there we go.

858
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,260
So you can get a sense of, you know, this bar represents all of the ones that rounded down to zero,

859
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:22,340
and you see it's about half of them, about half a million. All the ones that rounded down to one, rounded down to two.

860
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,960
And you can get this, um,

861
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:30,360
this nice sense for what all of your data is. Again, just adding that kind of empirical validation on top of whatever you find more

862
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,980
analytically. And that back and forth I really do think is helpful for more like pure mathematical problem solving.

863
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,640
So with that, that's actually all that I have for the lesson today.

864
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,040
Just two quick things that I want to go over before we end things here.

865
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:49,520
I've been using Desmos a lot to like show graphs of things because I just love Desmos.

866
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,000
And I'm actually friends with some of the people who work there because quite often

867
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:58,180
a company's people are as delightful as its products.

868
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:04,380
And the CEO Eli shared with me the fact that they were doing like an art contest among some students.

869
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,280
And I just wanted to showcase some of, I'm not sure if these are the winners or the finalists of the art contest,

870
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,320
but basically in various different categories of students who are, I think it was like 12 through 14,

871
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,400
15 through 17, or something like that,

872
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:23,800
using like mathematical graphs to try to draw pictures. Okay, so keep in mind what I'm about to show you are mathematical graphs

873
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,860
that someone wrote just with an analytic description and they were,

874
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,000
they were just prompted to create something artistic from that.

875
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,500
Okay, so

876
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,940
one of my favorites, and I think this one was from someone named Carrie,

877
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:42,940
is two giraffes that just from an artistic standpoint, it's actually quite lovely.

878
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,460
And then to think through like actually mathematically describing everything involved here, it's such a beautiful blend of

879
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,560
well, like the creative side of things, the artistic side with aesthetics and everything, and the analytic side.

880
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,820
Another that was, this is just genuinely insane.

881
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,460
This is by Katsini,

882
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,620
is a Bézier Knight.

883
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,920
So I definitely wanted to highlight this on behalf of the team over at Desmos, where each one of the curves here

884
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:16,080
is described according to something that's called a Bézier curve, very useful for computer graphics. It's a kind of cubic parametric

885
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,740
term, and they just recreated a starry knight in a way that's

886
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,980
completely beautiful, I think.

887
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,460
And then the very last one,

888
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,980
which is genuinely shocking that you can do with mathematical graphs in any way, was a self-portrait

889
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,900
by Jared, that's just

890
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,380
like genuinely insane.

891
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,440
I mean, I remember playing around with like a TI-84 and trying to come up with little pictures of like a smiley face and

892
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,140
things like that.

893
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:47,200
So the amount that things have changed in terms of when someone's noodling off with their graphing calculator in class and what they can do

894
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,580
truly next level.

895
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,260
And then at the very end, I just want to say again like a highlighted

896
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,520
thank you to Ben Eater and to Cam, who've been extremely helpful with the whole series in ways

897
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,880
that's like hard to even articulate properly.

898
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,260
Eater in particular, I mean, he's let me borrow a lot of his equipment and

899
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,460
helped out with like figuring out live footage type stuff because that's not something I usually do,

900
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,440
which is not even to mention the work on the live stats and live quizzes.

901
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:20,280
So if you aren't already familiar with his channel, it's simply named Ben Eater, like 100% check it out, definitely subscribe to it,

902
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:27,120
try some of the projects. He has a very project-oriented way of teaching. I think it's absolutely great. So cannot emphasize enough

903
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,480
how grateful I am in the direction of both of those two. And

904
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:37,080
check out the the item pool site where we are going to let you kind of relive the lockdown math experience and

905
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:41,620
have like homework and actual challenges associated with each one of them.

906
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,880
So stay tuned on that and if you're interested in being a beta user of it,

907
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,960
there will be forms for how you can reach out to both of them.

908
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,920
Thank you everyone for joining in the whole series. This has been very fun for me, very different for me.

909
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:59,120
And I will shortly get back to the more usual videos, which I'm very excited about. There's a couple topics that

910
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,600
I just think you're thoroughly going to enjoy,

911
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:07,400
especially if you like problem solving stuff like this, like really getting into good meaty problem solving. That's some of what's on the horizon.

912
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,960
And with that I will simply say keep loving math and enjoy the rest of your day.

913
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:32,620
So

914
01:07:52,920 --> 01:08:18,560
Thank you.
