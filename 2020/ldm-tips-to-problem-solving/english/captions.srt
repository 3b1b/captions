1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
Welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,877
It's hard to define exactly what mathematicians 

3
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:06,080
mean when they use the phrase problem solving.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,890
However you go about it, it's going to involve some notion of 

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,351
approaching puzzles that you've never seen before and still being 

6
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,760
able to systematically and creatively find some solution to them.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,865
But that's a weird thing when you think about it 

8
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:20,520
because it makes it a very hard thing to teach.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,598
I mean, you can teach someone how to solve one particular problem, 

10
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:26,660
maybe even a class of problems, and teach them how to solve another problem.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,535
But how do you teach someone how to approach a problem that 

12
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:32,220
they've never seen before and still make progress on it?

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,482
Well, I honestly don't know how, but what I want to do for this 

14
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,360
lecture is to talk through a couple different problem solving principles.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,396
I've enumerated nine of them in total, and each one we're 

16
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:44,120
going to walk through in the context of a specific example.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,980
And I think each one is kind of simple.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,827
You'll look at it and you'll nod along thinking, yeah, 

19
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:50,540
yeah, of course, that's a thing that you should do.

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,464
But I would argue that each one is deceptively simple, 

21
00:00:53,464 --> 00:00:56,610
that you would be shocked at how often you can make very meaningful 

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,802
progress in very hard problems just by keeping some of these tips in 

23
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:00,820
the back of your mind.

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,455
And to give you a little flavor for where we're going to be going today, 

25
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:09,801
I want to ask, not as a quiz that I expect you to necessarily be able to solve 

26
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:14,037
here on the spot, I want to ask you a question that we will be solving later 

27
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:17,833
on in the lecture, just so you can have it in the back of your mind, 

28
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:22,234
a little thing to mull over, and a hard problem that will be fun to tackle when 

29
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:23,060
the time comes.

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,479
So the question asks, suppose the two numbers are chosen at random from 

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,960
the range 0 through 1, and it's done according to a uniform distribution.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,640
So maybe you pick like 0.385 and 0.58962 or something like that.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,980
Each one is chosen at random.

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,537
Suppose p is the probability that the ratio of the 

35
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:45,000
first number to the second rounds down to an even number.

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,320
So, you know, maybe it rounds down to 0 or it rounds down to 2 or to 4.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
And basically it's asking you to guess where is this probability, you know?

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,480
We'll solve it exactly, we'll get an exact expression.

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,268
But just intuitively as you hear the problem and you think 

40
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:02,358
of choosing two random numbers between 0 and 1, 

41
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:05,580
looking at their ratio, what do you think that probability is going to be?

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,220
We'll return back to this later.

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,189
And one thing I want to say is that this whole live quizzing software, 

44
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,630
it's something that's being built by some friends of mine, Ben Eater, 

45
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,284
who many of you may know because of his YouTube fame, 

46
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:21,560
and then another person who used to work with us at Khan Academy named Cam Christensen.

47
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:25,069
And this is just one small little outcropping 

48
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,380
of what's actually a much deeper product at play.

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,210
And I want to give you a little preview of some of the other 

50
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,520
things that they've been working on that we'll be developing.

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,069
So if any of you want to share some of the lectures here or go back and kind of go 

52
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,352
through the live quizzing experience, if you go to the link that it's in the description, 

53
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:45,160
but it's at itempool.com slash c slash 3b1b, but you can follow the description.

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,708
You can basically watch the lectures in a way where you can do these live quizzes 

55
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,200
along with it and your progress is tracked and you get scores and things like that.

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
So as you skip ahead to various different questions, 

57
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,960
it will skip you to the right point in the video.

58
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,201
And as the video plays forward, you'll also get to, yeah, 

59
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:06,138
there's just me talking through some problem, you'll also get to whatever the appropriate 

60
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:07,400
part of the problem is.

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,880
They often have explanations associated with them and hints and things like that.

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,269
And ultimately, if you look back in just a couple days, 

63
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm going to fill out like homework and challenge problems.

64
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,689
So if you like challenging problem solving, contest math type stuff, 

65
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm going to put things that are relevant to the lectures in there, 

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,460
which I think should be fun.

67
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,540
It's not quite there yet, but definitely check back.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,309
And I'm sure just over the next couple months 

69
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,820
there will be more item pool shenanigans going on.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,930
If any of you want to use this, maybe to do some live polling in your own 

71
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,960
live classes for teachers who are dealing with the whole remote landscape.

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,500
Or if you have your own streams, anything like that.

73
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,360
They are looking for beta users, so feel free to reach out to them.

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,700
It should be available on the website.

75
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,820
Now let's dive into the actual content, shall we?

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,560
Some of the nine deceptively simple problem solving tricks.

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,243
And before we do, I want to specify that at some point today, 

78
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,520
in the next hour, I'm going to purposefully make a mistake.

79
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,500
Okay, and I tell you that for two reasons.

80
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,617
One, so that you keep your eye out and you, you know, 

81
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:09,080
you're a little bit skeptical of each of the claims that I make.

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,454
And two, so that when I make that mistake and you notice it, and you're just, 

83
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,938
you know, throwing things at the screen, you're getting angry, 

84
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,092
you're clicking that unsubscribe button, you can at least quell a little bit of 

85
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:18,920
what you're thinking.

86
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,360
So just keep that in mind.

87
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,920
There will be one very purposeful mistake.

88
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,360
Now before we get to the problem solving tip, I want to talk about geometry.

89
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,333
This is one thing I was hoping to do a little bit more of in this series, 

90
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,420
but this would be just a fun time to give a little example of it.

91
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,580
And in particular, I want to talk about one of my favorite little bits of geometry.

92
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,680
It's not too simple, but it's also not too hard.

93
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,460
It's called the inscribed angle theorem.

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,252
It comes up way more than is reasonable for a simple little 

95
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,260
theorem like this to actually come up when you're solving problems.

96
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,210
And basically an inscribed angle of a circle refers to if you have two lines that 

98
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,900
meet at a point of that circle, and what we care about is this little angle in here.

99
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,500
Okay.

100
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,063
And if you were just studying this, if you're an early mathematician trying 

101
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:11,806
to make sense out of this, you might make a guess that something about this 

102
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:15,500
angle is going to be related to the arc of the circle that those lines hit.

103
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,361
I mean that arc can also be described as an angle of some kind if we draw 

104
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,920
lines from the center of the circle, it makes it a little bit clearer.

105
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,460
So I'm just going to draw a couple green lines 

106
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,100
here and mark that we have a different angle here.

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,680
And maybe I give them names.

108
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,377
I'll call this one theta L for like the large angle, 

109
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,980
and this one I'm going to call theta S.

110
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,160
It's the small angle.

111
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,160
And you might wonder is there a relationship between these two angles?

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
And if so, what is it?

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
And for our purposes today, the question is how 

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,100
do you systematically approach a puzzle like this?

115
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,360
Find a relationship between these two and prove, prove its existence.

116
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,261
So problem solving tip, not problem sip, problem solving tip number one, 

117
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:06,940
which is just, just so useful in a way that again is kind of deceptively simple.

118
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,680
Make sure you're always using the defining features of whatever your setup is.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,499
I swear a good 70% of the problem sets that I did as an undergraduate 

120
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,720
math major essentially came down to looking at what was given, 

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,504
asking very critically what is the definition of each term involved here, 

122
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:25,340
unraveling those definitions, and then just seeing how they piece together.

123
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,600
So use whatever's the defining feature.

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,580
In our context, what is defining the various points and intersections that we have here?

125
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,280
Well, it's the idea that they're on a circle.

126
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,160
A circle is by definition all of the points that are a common distance from the center.

127
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,067
So in particular, we know that this length is a radius 

128
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,540
of the circle and this length is a radius of the circle.

129
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,360
We should use the fact that those are the same.

130
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,711
But moreover this other point P, that was not just chosen at random, 

131
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,620
it's defined to be on the circle.

132
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,535
And unraveling what that means, it means it is a common distance away 

133
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:02,340
and is the same distance away from the center as these other points.

134
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,652
So I am then inspired to draw a line to add something 

135
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:08,380
to the picture and to note that it's the same there.

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,690
You know quite often when you see people solve hard geometry problems, 

137
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,740
it comes down to adding something to the picture.

138
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,120
And the most beautiful geometry involves adding something that seems out of 

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,100
left field and it just illuminates everything, you shift your perspective.

140
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,500
And sometimes you look at it and you wonder like, how would you have known what to add?

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,136
Like again, I'm supposed to draw an extra circle here or put a, you know, 

142
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:30,380
put a rectangle around this triangle, whatever it is you're doing.

143
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,200
But how do you, how do you systematically know what you should add?

144
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,560
So in this context, if it relates to the definition of your objects, probably a good idea.

145
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,040
And that line actually will be helpful to us.

146
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
We can start giving a couple things names.

147
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,841
That's something that again, maybe it shouldn't even be described as a tip, 

148
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,317
but I've put it down as number two, that when you give things meaningful names, 

149
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,620
that actually helps you move forward in your problem.

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,940
And in this context, it might seem like an innocuous thing.

151
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,663
I'll call this little angle that we formed with 

152
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:01,160
our radius alpha and this little angle beta.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,864
And just to see if that helps us move forward, you know, 

154
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:08,733
recognizing if alpha and beta show up elsewhere, rather than me telling you, 

155
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,200
I would like you to tell me in the context of our next quiz question.

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,437
So before I answer that probability one for you, 

157
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm going to pull up question number two for today.

158
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,140
We've got a diagram, essentially what we just drew.

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,780
The dot in the middle is the center of the circle and I've labeled seven different angles.

160
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,340
I've just labeled them a through g.

161
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,380
And what I want you to do is tell me which of these equations is true.

162
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,100
One possibility is that four of the angles a, b, d, 

163
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,100
and e have a sum that's the same as c plus f plus g.

164
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,919
Which, just looking at c, f, and g, that would be 360 degrees, right?

165
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,840
The other is that a is equal to b and d is equal to e.

166
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,180
Another possibility is that c is equal to f.

167
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,940
And then maybe it's all of those or maybe it's none of those.

168
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,559
And it looks like we already have strong strong consensus on this one with 360, 400, 

169
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,796
just a strong large number of people coming in agreeing what they believe the right 

170
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:05,420
answer is.

171
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,227
And you know, if you if you want to be involved, the place to go, 3b1b.co live, 

172
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:13,960
that redirects you to an item pool page so that you can follow along.

173
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,410
And for those who are watching in the future, maybe you're watching it 

174
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,760
in the embedded page where the problem is just sitting right below you.

175
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,929
And even if you're not technically participating in the data contributing 

176
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,171
to the live statistics, when I was going through it, 

177
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,751
it's honestly pretty fun to just kind of click and like, oh, 

178
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,669
I know I'm not a part of this, but it kind of feels like I am a part 

179
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,600
of what was happening.

180
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,880
So I just love it.

181
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,540
All right, so because there's such strong consensus, I feel comfortable grading this.

182
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,080
Oh, I thought I got it right on 1 1 1 1.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,398
So the correct answer is that a is equal to b, d is equal to e, 

184
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:46,000
and then none of the others are necessarily true.

185
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,320
And let's walk through why that's the case, okay?

186
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,083
It comes down to exactly what we just highlighted, that these radii are common, 

187
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,160
which means, you know, let me just give more things names.

188
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,680
Let's call this point a, and this point b.

189
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,000
Maybe that's confusing because I was just naming angles a and b, 

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,460
but separate context, separate picture, you know what I mean.

191
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,800
The triangle a, p, and then the center of the circle, that's isosceles.

192
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,217
You know, there's this symmetry about, I could even draw the little axis of symmetry, 

193
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,600
and that tells us that this is also alpha.

194
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,033
Likewise, the triangle up here is isosceles, and 

195
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:27,480
that tells us that this has an angle of beta.

196
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,200
And what we just did, in effect, is leverage a little bit of symmetry.

197
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,296
In this case, it was innocuous, but quite often looking for symmetry in much harder 

198
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:41,620
setups, it's super generalizable and it definitely will help you move forward.

199
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,785
If you recognize that there's something symmetric, 

200
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:46,800
use that symmetry in some way, which is effectively what we've just done.

201
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,768
Giving things a couple more names, I might want to call this angle, 

202
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:55,026
I'll call it something related to the alphas, so maybe I just call it alpha prime, 

203
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,540
and similarly this angle over here is beta prime.

204
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,626
And by noting those facts, I have everything I need to do to 

205
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:05,180
draw a connection between this small angle and this large angle.

206
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,640
You essentially just write down the facts that 

207
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,480
we have based on the triangles we're looking at.

208
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,277
So the triangle with all of the alpha angles, the sum of those angles 

209
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:16,575
has to be 180 degrees, and there's two different alphas in there, 

210
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,022
and then there's an alpha prime, and instead of writing 180 degrees, 

211
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,520
of course we like radians, so I'm going to say that equals pi radians.

212
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,639
Similarly, the one with all of the betas tells us that if 

213
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,280
we take 2 times beta and we add beta prime, that's also pi.

214
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,750
And then the other fact that we have that's just popping right out from the 

215
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,380
image is that alpha prime, beta prime, and theta L add up to 360 degrees, or 2 pi.

216
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,745
So just writing down all of the relevant facts that we have, 

217
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:51,948
now we have some objects that we can manipulate and work with to draw some kind 

218
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:56,099
of conclusion, which again, we're looking for a connection between theta small 

219
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:56,940
and theta large.

220
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,797
And I know a lot of you, your 3Blue and Brown audience members, 

221
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:03,476
you know about the inscribed angle theorem, but I really want you to think about this 

222
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:04,760
from a beginner's mind, right?

223
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,101
If you were just approaching this and you didn't necessarily already know about it, 

224
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:10,011
what would you have done to find that solution, 

225
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,120
and what principles can you take away as you do that?

226
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,280
Because that helps us as we start to get to harder and harder geometry setups.

227
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,305
So in this context, once I have these three equations, 

228
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,885
recognizing that there's an alpha prime here and one here, 

229
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:24,340
there's a beta prime here and one here, I might think about canceling them out.

230
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,500
So I'm gonna, you know, add this top equation 

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,420
and maybe I subtract off the other two equations.

232
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,498
And to subtract these off, and what that means is the alpha prime gets cancelled, 

233
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:39,882
so does the beta prime, I'm left with my large angle, 

234
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm subtracting off 2 times alpha plus beta.

235
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,320
You know, each of those gets subtracted off with the coefficient 2.

236
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,512
And then we have 2 pi minus 2 copies of pi, so that's all equal to 0, 

237
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:54,069
which is saying the same thing as theta L is equal to 2 times, 

238
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:58,529
well rather than writing alpha plus beta, I'll just recognize that that is the 

239
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,280
small little angle that we had.

240
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,380
It's 2 times the small angle.

241
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,390
Again, I can't emphasize enough just what a weirdly useful fact 

242
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,520
this turns out to be in various geometry puzzles you might do.

243
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,223
It's definitely come up on the channel a number of times in circumstances regarding, 

244
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:17,820
you know, complex numbers or pure geometry situations, of course.

245
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,975
Just anytime you want to relate an angle to 2 times that angle, 

246
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:28,100
realizing them in the context of a circle like this can be strangely useful.

247
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,520
So this is just an image to have burned in your mind as you're solving problems.

248
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,889
And to give you one example of a problem that you can solve once this is sitting there, 

249
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,718
burned in the back of your mind, I want you to remember back to the lecture that we did 

250
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,460
on trigonometry, which conveniently is actually the example that I had pulled up here.

251
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,107
So one of the central things we were talking about was how just playing 

252
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:51,590
with graphs you can get this bizarre looking fact that if you square the cosine function, 

253
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,580
you get something that looks again just like a cosine graph.

254
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,733
And you can get more exact about that where if we start with an initial cosine 

255
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,734
graph and you manipulate it a little, you know, we shift it up, we scale it down, 

256
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:06,100
we say we need to double the frequency, you get the exact same graph.

257
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,827
So we have two different expressions for the same thing, 

258
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,460
but it's not at all obvious why these would be related.

259
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,810
One of them involves doubling the angle it's a reference to, 

260
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,800
the other involves squaring the output.

261
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,700
Okay, so it's a not obvious fact.

262
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,609
We proved it using complex numbers, but what I'd like to do is try to prove this 

263
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:28,320
using geometry to kind of viscerally see the fact pop out right in front of us.

264
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,101
And to do that, let's go ahead and write down what the 

265
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:35,360
fact is again so that we can start thinking about it.

266
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:40,209
We want to find that the cosine squared of theta, 

267
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,758
which is just saying take the cosine of theta and square it, 

268
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:50,800
it's that awkward notation, is equal to one half of one plus cosine of two theta.

269
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,766
You've got the strained relationship between squaring things and doubling the angle, 

270
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:58,201
which as we've talked about in the whole series is really a reflection of 

271
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:01,080
the fact that a cosine is a shadow of an exponential function.

272
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,508
But let's say you didn't know that, we want to see it viscerally and geometrically, 

273
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:07,320
so you don't already know the double angle identities or anything like that.

274
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,620
You just want a very direct understanding of this particular equation.

275
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,836
Well, one common thing that comes up is that a way to show the 

276
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:18,081
two non-obvious things are related or even equal is to see if 

277
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:21,640
you can find one object that you can describe in two different ways.

278
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,226
So we're going to look for one object that we have two different descriptions of, 

279
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,340
and this often can give you nice equations in this context.

280
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,200
It might mean relating the left and right hand side.

281
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,894
This comes up in combinatorics all the time when you have a counting puzzle where, 

282
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,766
you know, you do something like count how many ways you can have a string of five bits 

283
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:43,549
that are either zeros or ones, and on the one hand you can count it multiplicatively 

284
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,421
kind of going through each one and saying well you're multiplying the possibilities by 

285
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:47,600
two.

286
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,900
But on the other hand you can go iteratively and say well how many of them have no ones?

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,560
How many of them have one one, two ones?

288
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,060
Something that kind of seems harder and a more awkward way to count.

289
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,537
But by describing the same thing twice you end up with 

290
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:00,940
this really not obvious fact from an algebraic standpoint.

291
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,540
And we're going to do the same thing more geometrically here.

292
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,460
But again, just got to emphasize how like how general this ends up being.

293
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,080
So what we want is some kind of object that each of these describes.

294
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,074
And to do that, maybe we just think okay, let's let's draw a unit circle, 

295
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:20,440
which is where something like a cosine typically comes up.

296
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,340
Oh, for the first time in my life I drew a quarter circle arc that wasn't terrible.

297
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,000
It's not great, but usually that comes out much more disastrous.

298
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,800
How pleasing.

299
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,940
I should not be so pleased with a terrible quarter circle.

300
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,460
Great, okay.

301
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,240
So that's our angle theta, right?

302
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,780
And what does cosine mean in this context?

303
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,140
Not cosine squared, but just plain vanilla cosine.

304
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,459
Well, it tells us if we look at the x-coordinate of this point, 

305
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:53,280
that's the cosine of our angle.

306
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,953
And so now I want you to think about how can we 

307
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:58,460
represent the square of the cosine as some kind of object?

308
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,020
Some geometric thing that we can point to in this image.

309
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,616
And the first instinct might be something like, well, 

310
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:08,540
let's draw a square off the side of this, you know, 

311
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,520
something with area to it and interpret it like that.

312
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,460
But then there's going to be a problem if the principle that we're 

313
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,079
trying to apply is describing the same object in two different ways.

314
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,915
Because if we describe this left-hand side as some kind of area, 

315
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:25,095
that would mean that we have to find another description of that same area, 

316
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:27,460
that same object, with the right-hand side.

317
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,220
But that's going to be weird, because this doesn't involve squaring or anything like that.

318
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,920
If it's just a plain vanilla cosine term, it seems much more natural 

319
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,360
to describe that as some kind of ratio, or maybe some kind of length.

320
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,260
It's just that we need the 2 theta to pop up somehow.

321
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,874
So instead, let's seek a way to describe cosine squared that does not involve area, 

322
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:50,140
but is instead something more of the flavor of a ratio or a length.

323
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,320
And in this context, the key comes down to leveraging symmetry again.

324
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,840
And it's a sneaky bit of symmetry.

325
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,893
It's something we did talk about in the trig lecture, 

326
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,680
but I love it so much I'll talk about it again.

327
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,632
If we think of this angle theta, on the one hand it's telling us 

328
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:06,784
the angle between the x-axis and the line, but on the other hand 

329
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,840
it's also telling us the angle between the line and the x-axis.

330
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,666
And I know that sounds like the same thing, but it means when I say 

331
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:19,219
project down the point at the end of our radius, which was length 1, 

332
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:24,300
perpendicularly onto the x-axis, that length got scaled down by cosine theta.

333
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,120
But now what if I do things the other way?

334
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,420
What if I say I want to project down in a perpendicular fashion onto this line?

335
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,054
Well again, I just have two lines separated by an angle theta, 

336
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm doing a projection, which means it gets scaled down by the cosine of that angle.

337
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,364
So now I'm taking the cosine of theta scaled down by the cosine of theta, 

338
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:46,380
and it gets me cosine squared of theta.

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,074
So cosine squared refers to this length, a portion of the hypotenuse of our right 

340
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:57,520
triangle, if that hypotenuse had a length of 1, which in our unit circle it always does.

341
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,136
And incidentally, you can show very similar reasoning that the sine of theta is this 

342
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:07,091
other other portion of that hypotenuse, and this gives you a nice, 

343
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:10,101
sort of a clever proof of the Pythagorean theorem, 

344
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:13,465
the idea of double projecting based on asking, you know, 

345
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:18,660
is this line theta degrees away from that, or is that line theta degrees away from this?

346
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,736
Sounds like you're saying the same thing, but it gets you 

347
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,840
something of mathematical substance to recognize that symmetry.

348
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,540
Now, why do I say this?

349
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,420
Well, we have a representation of cosine squared.

350
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,460
What we want now is to do something in terms of 2 theta.

351
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,422
We just were thinking about a context where we're able to relate an angle to 2 theta, 

352
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,820
to 2 times that angle.

353
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,880
So somehow we want to realize this angle as an inscribed angle of some kind of triangle.

354
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,840
And I'll show you how you can do that.

355
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,599
But before I do, just to mention another fact that if you've been puzzling 

356
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,383
around with these sorts of things, might be burning in your mind, 

357
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:59,740
is a specific instance of the inscribed angle theorem called Thales theorem.

358
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,600
So let's say that that large angle we had, 2 theta, was actually 180 degrees, right?

359
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
It was pi radians.

360
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,900
What would that mean in terms of the inscribed angle theorem?

361
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,383
It means that if we take that diameter of the circle, if it's 180 degrees, 

362
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:20,028
it's just drawing out a diameter, and we have an inscribed angle with lines 

363
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:25,040
that hit either end of that diameter, then this angle is necessarily half of that.

364
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,126
So what it means is that we can put a right triangle inside a circle, 

365
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:33,931
and whenever you do that, the hypotenuse of the right triangle is exactly the diameter 

366
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:34,760
of that circle.

367
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,020
It's a very cute fact.

368
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,172
If you wanted another proof of it, that's not just via the inscribed angle theorem, 

369
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:45,104
there's another very wonderful leveraging of symmetry that you can do, 

370
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:47,818
where basically you take this point and you say, 

371
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:52,692
I'm going to reflect it through the origin, reflect it through the center of my circle, 

372
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:53,800
and see where I get.

373
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,717
And recognize that reflecting through the center 

374
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,900
is the same as rotating the whole image 90 degrees.

375
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,170
So if I rotated the image, not 90, 180 degrees, 

376
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,780
my other vertex would end up at that same point.

377
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,114
But now what we have is a quadrilateral, and one of the diagonals is the diameter 

378
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:14,439
of the circle, but the other diagonal is also diameter of the circle, 

379
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,428
which in particular means they have the same midpoint and they're the same distance 

380
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:22,370
apart, and you can convince yourself a little that implies it must be a rectangle, 

381
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,360
that could also be a little side homework problem if you wanted to chase around the 

382
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,120
relevant angles.

383
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,455
But I think that's a very beautiful way to think about Thale's theorem, 

384
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,541
that you reflect everything 180 degrees, and you necessarily conclude 

385
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,320
it must be a rectangle, which means that this is a right angle.

386
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,440
Now for our purposes, what does that mean?

387
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,512
Well, we've got a right triangle sitting here that's from zero, 

388
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:44,160
we've got one of the points here, another point on the circle.

389
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,180
Let's inscribe that in a separate circle, okay?

390
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,608
So I'm going to take a copy of that triangle, but I'm going to, 

391
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:54,965
instead of making the hypotenuse a radius of the circle, 

392
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm going to make that hypotenuse a diameter of the circle.

393
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,480
So this is still going to be an angle of theta, sitting right here.

394
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,645
The, uh, basically I flipped it around, so previously it was here, 

395
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:12,063
but I flipped it around so that my 90 degree angle is sitting up and to the right, 

396
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,660
rather than sitting down here.

397
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,939
The length that we care about is what happens when we project from the point at that 90 

398
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,928
degree angle in a perpendicular fashion down onto the hypotenuse, 

399
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,500
which now looks like this.

400
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,240
And what we care about is this long length, okay?

401
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,256
And actually, let me ask you as a live quiz, to see if you can come up with an 

402
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:40,560
expression for that length in the context of the diagram that we're now looking at.

403
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,840
So, pulling up our quiz again, congratulations to everyone who got this one correct.

404
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,773
Let me give you a little bit of time to think about this one, 

405
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:55,640
because this is, uh, this is kind of a heart, part of the heart of this particular proof, 

406
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,020
and I think it's very, very pleasing to see.

407
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,340
So it specifies that the hypotenuse of the large right triangle above has a length of one.

408
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,415
Our context is because it came from the hypotenuse of the triangle 

409
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:09,540
drawn in a unit circle, so the hypotenuse has a length of one.

410
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,180
What is the length l in terms of theta?

411
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,800
Okay, so can you find an expression for l in terms of theta?

412
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,122
And I'll give you a little bit of, uh, a little bit of time for that, 

413
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:24,660
bring back our pause and ponder music, get myself a chance to take a drink.

414
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,280
So, once again, it looks like we have some strong consensus for today.

415
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,800
So while answers are rolling in, before I grade it, 

416
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,170
I'm just going to go ahead and start describing how it goes, 

417
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,580
since it seems like a lot of you are already well ahead of me.

418
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,020
It's fun to have though.

419
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,460
So of course, we're going to use the inscribed angle theorem.

420
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,740
That is the whole reason I'm bringing it up here.

421
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,360
It's a way to relate a single angle to twice that angle.

422
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,398
So in this context, I would draw some lines from the center of my, uh, 

423
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:17,214
of my new smaller circle that has radius only one half, 

424
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:19,600
and recognize that this is 2 theta.

425
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,940
And this is just lovely now, isn't it?

426
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,480
Because what is the length we care about?

427
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,423
Part of it, excuse me, part of it is the radius, which is one half, 

428
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:36,726
but then the projection down according to 2 theta onto this remaining 

429
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:42,760
leg ends up being that radius one half times the cosine of 2 theta.

430
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,780
And of course, that's exactly what we want it to be.

431
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,321
We've got the whole radius, which is one half, 

432
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,620
and then we're multiplying that by 1 plus the cosine of 2 theta.

433
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,100
It's a radius of the circle times a scaled down version of that radius.

434
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,061
So that's two different ways of viewing the same object, 

435
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,739
which is what we get when we take this right triangle and we 

436
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:03,680
project down and look at what part of the hypotenuse that cuts off.

437
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,769
And it gives us this non-trivial relationship in trigonometry 

438
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:09,360
between the cosine squared and the cosine of 2 theta.

439
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,622
The fact that otherwise we were going into like 

440
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,740
complex numbers and exponentials to understand.

441
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,080
So I think that's quite beautiful.

442
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,816
I think that's just, um, one of the many many instances of where 

443
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:22,720
the inscribed angle theorem suspiciously slos- suspiciously shows up.

444
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,754
Um, and again, what I want you to take away is this principle that if you 

445
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:29,644
can have one object described in two different ways, 

446
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:32,424
very powerful in terms of showing non-obvious, um, 

447
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:36,404
algebraic relations or anything that's kind of written down symbolically 

448
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,640
without immediate intuition on top of it.

449
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,828
So with all of that, let's actually turn to the probability 

450
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:44,320
question that I asked at the beginning of the lecture.

451
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,721
So going back to our live quiz, uh, I will go ahead 

452
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:56,420
and grade what we- we all know know the correct answer.

453
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,180
So for those of you- wait a minute.

454
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,620
Oh, it was marked incorrectly.

455
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,840
Oh, that's my bad.

456
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,880
No, I just slipped this one in like last minute before the lesson today.

457
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,260
Um, so I might have like swapped around what the answers were.

458
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,143
So, uh, well, it looks like 1380 if we were absolutely 

459
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:16,140
wrong according to whatever jerk wrote this quiz.

460
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,594
So, I don't know how that shows up on the user interface if it's like shocking red like, 

461
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:25,760
oh no, but, uh, D was the actual correct answer here.

462
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,860
So congratulations to those of you who got that.

463
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,720
Now back to our probability question.

464
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,180
I'm curious to see what people said on this one just in terms of their instincts.

465
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,311
So this one we had a little bit more of a spread and, ah, interesting, 

466
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:44,161
here the actual correct answer does show up quite a bit- quite a bit lower than- and 

467
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:47,813
now I'm questioning myself to make sure that I've actually, um, 

468
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:49,640
written the thing appropriately.

469
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,190
So just as a reminder of what the question is, 

470
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,226
we're choosing two random numbers from the range zero through one, 

471
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:58,308
each according to a uniform distribution, and we're- we're guessing 

472
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:01,480
what the probability that they round down- the ratio of these numbers 

473
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,840
rounds down to an even number.

474
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,272
Remember zero is an even number, so that it rounds 

475
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,540
down to zero or two or four or anything like that.

476
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,829
Now this is a tricky problem to think about and, uh, definitely no- no fault at all for, 

477
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:18,400
uh, anyone who isn't immediately able to see roughly where it should be.

478
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,662
But I think, um, with a- with a little bit of progress on our way, 

479
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:24,804
even before we get the exact solution, we can get to a point where 

480
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:28,040
you might be able to intuitively give some kind of ballpark estimate.

481
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,820
So what have we got here?

482
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,200
Choosing two random numbers between zero and one.

483
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,603
I think that's a weird thing to think about, um, 

484
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:38,533
especially if you're not familiar with probability that well or 

485
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:42,380
when the phrase uniform distribution is thrown up if it's not clear what that means.

486
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,184
Um, but essentially, uh, it's what you would expect where you're choosing some 

487
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:51,569
random point on this line, and the idea is that each point is as likely as another, 

488
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,911
or more specifically a given range of points of a certain size, 

489
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:59,140
should have a given probability that's independent of where that range showed up.

490
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,560
It's only dependent on its size.

491
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,660
You know, so you might have in the back of your mind the idea that 

492
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,420
we've chosen two points, they're each somewhere between zero and one.

493
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,780
And just to give an example of what we mean by uniform distribution, 

494
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,420
the probability that x sits between 0.3 and like 0.5.

495
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,530
Because it's going to be somewhere between zero and one, 

496
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,490
and the length of that range is 0.2, about a fifth of the entire length it 

497
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,600
could have come from.

498
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,696
What it means to be uniform is that that probability is 

499
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:32,780
actually just the length of the segment that it came from.

500
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,386
Now, one thing you might ask is, well, what if, 

501
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:40,220
what about the probability that it's precisely 0.3 or precisely 0.5?

502
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,480
Would it matter if we made these less than or equal to signs?

503
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,557
And the answer is it doesn't actually matter, because the probability 

504
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:49,780
of hitting any specific value on a real number line ends up being zero.

505
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,140
This is a thing many find very confusing.

506
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,134
How can a probability of an event that's possible, 

507
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:58,460
it's definitely possible to hit 0.3, have probability zero?

508
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,637
Made a whole video about it trying to describe this, 

509
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:05,595
but really what it comes down to is that the things that have probability, 

510
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:07,020
you should think of ranges.

511
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,507
Those are the fundamental objects, and it doesn't really matter 

512
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:13,440
how we treat the boundary and just think in terms of ranges.

513
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,748
Even still though, what we're asking is a very bizarre question, 

514
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:22,274
which is if we take the ratio of x and y and we round that down, which sometimes, 

515
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:25,476
you know, mathematicians write using this floor function, 

516
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:28,512
saying we find the greatest integer smaller than that, 

517
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:30,720
how do we know if that's an even number?

518
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,380
That's a weird thing to think about, it's a hard problem in that way.

519
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,656
So, you know, if you think through the principles here, 

520
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:39,320
it's kind of like use the defining features of the setup.

521
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,720
Well, not clear how to use the fact that it's a uniform distribution.

522
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,234
I guess we'll be using lengths in some way to yield probabilities, 

523
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:49,680
so maybe that gives us some geometry, but that's not really helpful.

524
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,570
Give things meaningful names, you know, maybe x and y 

525
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,340
are meaningful or some something suggestive like that.

526
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,000
Symmetry, okay, maybe, you know, the idea that choosing x and then y is 

527
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,400
as likely as choosing y than x, you could use that to conclude that this 

528
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,560
ratio x over y is as likely to be above one as it is to be below one.

529
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,136
And that actually does tell you something, because if we're wondering how 

530
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:17,918
often do you round down to be zero, right, you can say well x over y is as likely to be, 

531
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:21,680
x is as likely to be bigger than y as y is likely to be bigger than x.

532
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,420
So there's a 50-50 chance that this should happen.

533
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,060
This would be a probability of 50 percent.

534
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,504
So that gets you somewhere, which is kind of nice, 

535
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:36,288
but it's not clear how you would apply that to things like even numbers, same object, 

536
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,520
two different ways, unclear.

537
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,280
So principle number five here is where we're going to come in.

538
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,740
Again, it seems simple.

539
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,066
It's something that you can not be like, yeah, yeah, 

540
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,780
drawing pictures, it helps to think through what I'm looking at.

541
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,854
But really, when you find yourself struggling with some setup that's not already 

542
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:56,364
visual or pictorial, you know, it doesn't have to be making a geometric, 

543
00:30:56,364 --> 00:31:00,355
but just having some kind of sketch, uh, to give meaning to your terms can be very 

544
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:00,740
helpful.

545
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,637
And as a more specific problem solving tip, when you have some numbers, 

546
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:08,760
multiple different numbers, see if you can make them coordinates in some space.

547
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,369
So rather than thinking about x and y as separate things here, 

548
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,760
we'll want to think about a single point with xy coordinates.

549
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,569
And what that does for us is it actually turns the 

550
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,740
whole problem two-dimensional in a very helpful way.

551
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,495
So first of all, I've lost track of my straight edge, 

552
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:25,300
which, where have you gone little straight edge?

553
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,180
I can only throw you so far.

554
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:27,960
Oh, here we go.

555
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,060
Things, they run away from you.

556
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:38,519
Even your objects sometimes get tired of math class and want to play truant now and then, 

557
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,800
but he has to stay whether he likes to or not.

558
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,140
Absurd.

559
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,040
So let's say this is our x coordinate.

560
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,920
x can fall anywhere between 0 and 1 with uniform probability.

561
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,180
y can fall between 0 and 1.

562
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,222
So when we have a pair of numbers, you know, something like 0.2, what is that, 

563
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:04,740
maybe like 0.8, pair of numbers, it's just a single point in this diagram.

564
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,985
And now to choose both of those numbers uniformly at random means that 

565
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:12,900
we're choosing a random point inside a square, a square with side length 1.

566
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,459
And now maybe we can make a little bit of progress, 

567
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:20,440
because it's going to come down to some view of what's going on in this square.

568
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,449
Now with this specific example, if we're thinking about the ratio x over y, 

569
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:32,038
and taking its floor, taking, just rounding it down, well, that's 0.2 over 0.8, 

570
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,580
that's going to round down to 0, so this would end up being even.

571
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,000
And like I just said, that that happens with 50% probability.

572
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,346
But let's see if we can try to find a way of thinking 

573
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:46,020
about that that generalizes up to other examples.

574
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,130
And again, one very useful thing, if you get stuck, 

575
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,224
that I have enumerated down here as principle number six, 

576
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,260
is to ask a simpler variant of the problem.

577
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,160
You're solving something, it's hard.

578
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,240
It's too hard.

579
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,370
See if you can make it simpler in a way that you 

580
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,080
actually can solve and get some kind of foothold.

581
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,981
Maybe that means loosening the constraints of the problem in some setups, 

582
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:10,040
or maybe it means looking at a sub-problem.

583
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,742
So in our context, rather than asking the probability that it rounds down to be even, 

584
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,405
let me just ask the probability that it becomes one, 

585
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:19,817
but I want you to answer it in a geometric way, 

586
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:22,833
something that will generalize to rounding to other things, 

587
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:27,004
because the next simpler question might be probability that it rounds down to two, 

588
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,060
and things like that.

589
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,460
You know where this is going to go.

590
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,041
We're going to do it as a live quiz because rather than me answering things, 

591
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,860
I want you guys to answer things for me.

592
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,235
So jumping up to question number four at this point, 

593
00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:40,760
it's going to give us a couple different diagrams.

594
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:46,256
Okay, we've got a, b, c, and d, and it's asking us which of these four regions 

595
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:51,228
corresponds to values of x and y, where taking the floor of x divided by y is 

596
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:56,520
equal to zero, which is to say you take the ratio, you round it down, you get zero.

597
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,920
Which region corresponds to that fact?

598
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:26,233
So, okay, I'm going to go ahead and lock in answers, 

599
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:39,033
but if you want to keep thinking about it, definitely feel free to pause 

600
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:42,540
the video and do so.

601
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,500
I don't want to rush anyone.

602
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,140
So it looks like 1265 of you, 1273, always answers rolling in at the end, 

603
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,520
correctly answered that it's c.

604
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,620
And let's take a moment to think about why that's the case.

605
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,864
Okay, you can do so just with a pile of examples and just see which one 

606
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,549
seemed to fall in the region or not, but let's see if we can understand 

607
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:07,080
this in a way that lets us make progress onto the other even numbers.

608
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,212
So when we say that it rounds down to zero, what we're basically 

609
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:13,200
saying is that that ratio sits somewhere between zero and one.

610
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,770
And it's awkward to think of x divided by y, we kind of like to think of y in terms of x, 

611
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,513
so if I multiply everything by y, which is okay to do with these inequalities because y 

612
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:28,203
is always positive, so that's not going to affect whether the inequality flips one way 

613
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:33,000
or another, I multiply everything by y, and we're basically asking when is x less than y?

614
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,014
And whenever you see an inequality, the boundary of 

615
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,740
that region is going to be described by the equality.

616
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,300
So we're going to wonder when is it the case that y equals x?

617
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,900
Well, that's just a straight line that goes diagonally.

618
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:53,420
If we draw our line y equals x, that's what we get.

619
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,961
Now that's the boundary of our region, and to know whether we should 

620
00:35:56,961 --> 00:36:00,877
look to the left of it or to the right of it, either you can think very directly and say, 

621
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:03,791
well, you know, y should be greater than x, so at a given point we 

622
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,880
want to move upward in the positive y direction.

623
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,969
You could look at a specific example like this, but however you do it, 

624
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:14,404
you'll draw the conclusion that geometrically the region of points such that 

625
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:19,300
x divided by y rounds down to zero is this sort of grilled cheese cut of our diagram.

626
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,147
So with that, maybe you can start to think about the harder variant, 

627
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:29,540
which is when is it that x divided by y rounds down to be two?

628
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,580
And again, I don't want to answer it.

629
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,600
I want you to answer it.

630
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,075
When is it that x divided by y inside our unit 

631
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:43,240
square of points x comma y rounds down to two?

632
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,514
And we've got four possible geometric regions that this could correspond to, 

633
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:49,460
a, b, c, and d.

634
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,764
And really, you know, rather than just thinking about which of these is it, 

635
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:57,060
really try to think through why it's the case and how you can prove 

636
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,260
that one of these boundaries is actually what it's supposed to be.

637
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,004
For example, I want it to be the case that if I didn't show the correct answer here, 

638
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:07,442
let's say I was just trolling with everyone and I didn't show the correct answer, 

639
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,791
you would be able to confidently come and say like, no, 

640
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:13,020
I'm quite positive that the correct answer is nothing that you've shown here.

641
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,180
See if that's the level of reasoning that you can put behind it.

642
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,580
So again, I'll give you give you a little moment to think about that.

643
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:47,991
So so Okay, so once again, I'm going to lock in answers potentially 

644
00:37:47,991 --> 00:38:10,120
earlier than you want me to, but keep the lesson moving forward.

645
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,082
No hard feelings if things haven't clicked yet, 

646
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,180
because hopefully the explanation will make them do so.

647
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,564
So the correct answer is c, which it looks like most of you got, 

648
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,200
and let's go ahead and think through why that's the case.

649
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,600
Very similar reasoning to what we were just doing.

650
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,016
The idea is that rather than thinking about this ratio and a floor, 

651
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:32,208
which is kind of a kind of an awkward thing, let's explicitly write out the inequality 

652
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,220
this is referring to.

653
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,968
It's saying that x divided by y is greater than or equal to 2 if it's 

654
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:42,400
rounding down to that, but it's not greater than 3, so it's less than 3.

655
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,080
And, you know, again, it's a little bit awkward to think of this ratio.

656
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,505
So let's write that as 2 times y is less than or equal to x, 

657
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:55,480
which is less than or equal to 3 times y.

658
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,304
Now quite often we don't think of y as a function of x, 

659
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:02,800
we think of x as a function of y, if that makes you feel more comfortable.

660
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,340
So if you want in the back of your mind, you can kind of think 2y less than or equal to x.

661
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,660
Well, that's the same thing as saying y is less than or equal to x halves.

662
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,506
And same deal, 3y being greater than x, that's the 

663
00:39:16,506 --> 00:39:20,960
same thing as saying y is greater than x divided by 3.

664
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,680
Because that way we can look at the equalities associated with each of these.

665
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,220
The line y equals x halves, which has a slope of one half, 

666
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,260
you can think of it as intersecting at the point where y equals one half when x equals 1.

667
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,800
Right, so it'll be a line like this that describes part of the boundary of our region.

668
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,780
And the other line is when y is equal to x thirds.

669
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,990
So we know we actually have to be above this line that I'm about to draw, 

670
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:54,600
where one of these represents x over 2, and one of these represents x over 3.

671
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,320
And then part of the part of the intrusion into the space of my last inequality.

672
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,620
All right, so we want to be above the x equals x over 3 below the x divided by 2.

673
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,960
This region here shows us everything where rounding down gets to 2.

674
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,453
And I want you to appreciate how this is a kind of complicated thing to 

675
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:18,660
think about if we hadn't gone into a picture that involves two dimensions.

676
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,220
If you were just thinking of x and y varying along this line and wondering when 

677
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,780
is it the case that x is more than twice, or y is more than two times what x is.

678
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,660
No, yeah, sorry.

679
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,640
x is more than two times what y is, but it's not three times more than what y is.

680
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,320
It's not, not, no, I said it wrong.

681
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,140
I said it wrong.

682
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:42,080
When y is more than two times what x is, but it's not three times more than x is.

683
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,620
It's very easy to get fuddled in that way.

684
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,357
And it's even harder to try to give some sort of probability to that, 

685
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:50,600
whereas in our diagram it has a very clear meaning.

686
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,526
It is the area of this region because the full area of possibilities already is one, 

687
00:40:56,526 --> 00:41:00,710
so this, the probability of something happening should be one, 

688
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,700
and we just need to look at the area of that.

689
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,939
And now maybe you can see where this is going to go, 

690
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:12,956
because for the next term when we want to know when does x divided by 

691
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:17,687
y sit between four and five, we're going to be drawing lines that 

692
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:19,480
intersect at x over four.

693
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
Maybe I'll go to a different color for this one.

694
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,743
x over four and x over five, which is going to require very small 

695
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:32,200
handwriting at this point, but I'm going to give it a try nevertheless.

696
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,956
x fourths, y equals x fifths, and this little sliver of area 

697
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:44,860
gives us all of the times that our ratio x over y rounds to be four.

698
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,670
And we're going to have to add infinitely many of these, 

699
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,080
so that gives us sort of another phase of challenge to the problem.

700
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,089
I've drawn this all out in Desmos, by the way, 

701
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,706
if you want to just sort of see what some of these regions look like, 

702
00:41:56,706 --> 00:42:00,117
where we've got our top region of places where it rounds to zero, 

703
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,355
then we've got another region corresponding to rounding to two, rounding to four, 

704
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,560
rounding to six, and just on and on each one of these regions.

705
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,700
Rounding and rounding, rounding.

706
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,902
I only went out to like a hundred or something like that, 

707
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:15,400
but that gives you a sense of what we're trying to do.

708
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,800
So we've made progress, but this is still hard.

709
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,780
What is the area of all of those triangles added together?

710
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,300
Right, that's not necessarily an obvious thing.

711
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,800
So let's just start by writing it out and seeing what help that can give us.

712
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,920
So every one of these is a triangle, it's going to look like one half base times height.

713
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,941
And in fact every one of them, if we think of the left right 

714
00:42:35,941 --> 00:42:38,760
direction as being their height, every one of them has a height of one.

715
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,860
So each one is going to look like one half times a base of some kind.

716
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,495
So I'm going to take, maybe I'll write this out on a 

717
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,800
different piece of paper actually so I can keep it up close.

718
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,100
I'll take one half times whatever the base of the triangle is times the height.

719
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,280
So our first triangle, that base is, that base has a length one.

720
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,480
So that's going to correspond to the one half probability of going to zero.

721
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,900
The next triangle, we have to look at this length here between one third and one half.

722
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,760
What is that length?

723
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,720
Well, actually I'm just going to write it out as a half minus a third.

724
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,314
It equals a sixth, but writing it out like that kind of reminds us where it came from, 

725
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:19,380
so we don't want to collapse things too soon.

726
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,160
That could maybe be another problem solving tip, don't collapse things too soon.

727
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,982
Try to let your notation have a memory for where things 

728
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:28,920
came from because sometimes that helps see overall patterns.

729
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,440
This next one, what's the distance between these two points?

730
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,720
Well, it's a fourth minus a fifth.

731
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,080
That's the distance between these given how they were defined.

732
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,740
So we have a fourth minus a fifth.

733
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,192
And in general we have this kind of oscillating sum, a sixth minus a seventh, 

734
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:48,429
where we have all the reciprocals of the natural numbers, 

735
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:52,001
but we're adding that up infinitely many different times, okay, 

736
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:54,680
and we want to know what that sum happens to be.

737
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,330
And from here, the problem solving tip associated with this will seem a little bit 

738
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:07,620
strange, but it might be the case that you recognize this fact from somewhere else.

739
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,735
You might recognize, let's say if you were watching a particular lockdown math 

740
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:16,231
lecture a week or two ago, that this alternating sum, 

741
00:44:16,231 --> 00:44:20,634
one minus a half plus a third minus fourth plus a fifth, on and on, 

742
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:23,160
actually equals the natural log of two.

743
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,680
Okay.

744
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:28,594
And the way this actually came about, it's such a weird procedure, 

745
00:44:28,594 --> 00:44:32,021
it's worth just like walking through again really quickly because it's a bizarre 

746
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:35,236
thing that you're not gonna, you're not gonna be able to just stare at this 

747
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:38,452
formula and then immediately see that this is how you're going to solve it, 

748
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:42,260
unless it's something that you've seen before, which can make it seem all the more opaque.

749
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,248
We did this strange thing where we made it seem like a harder question at first, 

750
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:51,657
where rather than asking about one particular sum, we turned it into a function, 

751
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:55,740
which is effectively asking about infinitely many different sums like this.

752
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,320
So x to the fourth over four, then we're adding x to the fifth over five.

753
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,617
And the reason for doing this is that this plays nicely in calculus land, 

754
00:45:05,617 --> 00:45:09,914
because those denominators are now related to the exponents in a way that 

755
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:13,224
we can kind of cancel out by doing an integration trick, 

756
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:17,580
each one of those terms I can nicely express as an integral of a much more 

757
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,800
simple monomial term.

758
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,680
x cubed minus, now let's see, plus x to the fourth.

759
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,694
If I integrate this thing, each one of them has an exponent 

760
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:31,840
that increases and then we divide by what the exponent is.

761
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,165
And the reason that you would want to do this is 

762
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:39,600
that this now has a nice way to collapse itself.

763
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,468
So just to make this maybe more explicit, if we evaluate the integral from zero to one, 

764
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:47,710
that's the same as taking this whole expression and evaluating 

765
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,460
it at one and subtracting at zero.

766
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,960
So that will give us what happens when we plug in at one.

767
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,547
And again, this is just such a bizarre thing that if you hadn't recognized the sum, 

768
00:45:56,547 --> 00:45:59,955
seeing someone prove it to you like this doesn't necessarily make it feel 

769
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:03,546
like something that you could have found, which is frustrating in the context 

770
00:46:03,546 --> 00:46:06,540
of trying to develop problem solving tips that are generalizable.

771
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,080
But I'll keep walking through it just to give a little bit of closure to this.

772
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,026
We've got this infinite sum that if you had been familiar with geometric sums, 

773
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:19,601
where each term looks like a certain product from the last, 

774
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:22,699
you would be able to write this as 1 over 1 plus x, 

775
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:25,500
because we're always multiplying by negative x.

776
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,548
So you always take 1 over 1 minus the thing you're multiplying by, which again, 

777
00:46:29,548 --> 00:46:33,900
it's kind of one of these things where it's relying on you recognizing it in some way.

778
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,103
And then the last bit of recognition is knowing 

779
00:46:37,103 --> 00:46:39,580
how to take integrals of 1 divided by a thing.

780
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,220
And in this context it works out very nicely to just be the natural log.

781
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,785
And we're evaluating this between 0 and 1, which is to say we're taking 

782
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:54,580
the natural log of 1 plus 1, or 2, minus the natural log of 1, which is 0.

783
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,640
And that's why all of these things are the natural log of 2.

784
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,413
And think about what has to go on there in order to be able 

785
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:04,220
to take this and then apply it to our probability question.

786
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,363
You would have to recognize the alternating sum as something that you had seen from 

787
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:12,282
another context, or if you didn't, you would have to be aware of this trick to somehow 

788
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:15,480
turn it into a polynomial that can be nicely expressed as an integral, 

789
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,777
that can be collapsed because of geometric series, 

790
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:20,300
which can be integrated because of the natural log of x.

791
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,346
And then thinking about like, what is what is the thing that you can teach 

792
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:27,760
someone to say come away and be able to solve problems in the same way?

793
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,632
I have what might seem like kind of a facetious tip, 

794
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:35,580
but I actually think it's maybe the most potent one and the most honest one.

795
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,460
The way that you can get to this sort of point, just read a lot.

796
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,660
Read as much as you can.

797
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,880
You know, watch YouTube videos on math if they're substantive, things like that.

798
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,906
And think a lot about problems, which is maybe frustrating 

799
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,448
because what you want is to be able to say like, well, 

800
00:47:49,448 --> 00:47:52,960
how could I have come to this on my own without having merely recognized it?

801
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,928
But I think the truth of the matter is a lot of what looks like insight and ingenuity 

802
00:47:56,928 --> 00:48:00,500
is really just pattern recognition, but wearing a little bit of added clothing.

803
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,250
And sometimes it's patterns not so much that you're directly recognizing exactly this, 

804
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,540
but maybe you had seen a series like this or a tactic like this before.

805
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,520
Like geometric series, that comes up a lot.

806
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,972
If you read a lot, and if you think a lot about problems, 

807
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:16,039
you will recognize geometric series, even if it's in a context that you've 

808
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,680
never actually seen before, or a specific geometric series that you've never seen before.

809
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,822
Similarly, if you read a lot and you think a lot about calculus, 

810
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:25,935
knowing that you can have the natural log pop out of an integral like this, 

811
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:26,960
it becomes second nature.

812
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,388
And I think recognizing the truth of this as being the key 

813
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:33,140
to a lot of problem solving is actually pretty inspiring.

814
00:48:34,439 --> 00:48:38,211
Because oftentimes you find yourself in a situation where somebody is, 

815
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:42,940
they're just faster, they're just better, they just recognize things more so than you do.

816
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,040
And that can be a little bit intimidating, right?

817
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,806
To look at one problem, think of yourself as pretty savvy with math and knowing 

818
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:52,715
what's going on, and then just having someone burn through with a wonderful bit of 

819
00:48:52,715 --> 00:48:56,717
cleverness, this super beautiful argument, that leaves you sitting there in the dust 

820
00:48:56,717 --> 00:49:00,720
wondering like, wow, I just, you know, I'm just not in the same league at all, right?

821
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,800
And you sometimes even think, well, he just has a math gene, right?

822
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,952
That person, they just have some sort of innate 

823
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:08,240
instinct that makes them really good at this stuff.

824
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,827
But I think the truth of the matter is that the people who are 

825
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:15,187
showing that kind of ingenuity, they've just exposed themselves 

826
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:18,600
to a huge number of patterns, and you too could get there, right?

827
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,100
There is a path towards that which takes the form of practice.

828
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,168
But not just practice, practice where you're taking each problem that 

829
00:49:25,168 --> 00:49:28,220
you're looking at and trying to digest the deeper principles behind it.

830
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,742
Maybe some of the ones I'm trying to talk through today, like, 

831
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:33,400
okay, I can say leverage symmetry, but what does that actually mean?

832
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,411
You know, what does it mean to look at a symmetry of a problem 

833
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:38,520
and turn that into something that's formulaically useful?

834
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,400
You just have to see it a lot, and then be pensive when you do.

835
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,430
Don't just be satisfied with the answer, see if 

836
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,200
you can understand why that answer came out.

837
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,942
So in that way, this number seven, like, it's the most frustrating, 

838
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:54,972
but it's the most real of all the problem solving tips that there can be, 

839
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:59,328
which is that true problem solving comes down to a kind of pattern recognition, 

840
00:49:59,328 --> 00:50:01,180
and there's no two ways around it.

841
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,100
You just have to do a lot of practice and expose yourself to a lot.

842
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,774
Now I would bet that when we did talk about this infinite series a couple lectures back, 

843
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:11,360
you wouldn't have thought that that's a thing that you're going to 

844
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,020
be using in a probability question one day.

845
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,460
But that's just how these things go.

846
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,180
They show up in unexpected places.

847
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,930
So what you can do then, is say, well, we've got our whole expression that 

848
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,236
involves this very alternating sum, and you'd say, okay, 

849
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:27,890
that means that the answer to our final question is, you know, 

850
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,920
one half of the natural log of two.

851
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,367
It's one half of what that alternating sum came out to be, which is very nice, 

852
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,038
you know, it involves this natural log expression, and it's very clean, 

853
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:41,811
and we've got this picture for where it came from adding up all of these, 

854
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:42,780
all of these areas.

855
00:50:43,259 --> 00:50:47,554
Now at this point, there is one thing that I think separates really good problem solvers, 

856
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:50,321
the ones who get like nearly perfect scores all the time, 

857
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:54,520
to ones who are like merely good, who, you know, they aren't necessarily perfect scores.

858
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,840
There's some like silly mistakes that come in here or there.

859
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,699
At this point, when you've done the problem and you've got your nice elegant solution, 

860
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,940
you want to draw a box around it, you're not done.

861
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,300
Just always, always, principle number eight here, always gut check your answer.

862
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,660
Okay, because there's going to be some little mistake that happens all the time.

863
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,735
The great problem solvers aren't the ones who just never make little mistakes, 

864
00:51:16,735 --> 00:51:19,560
they're the ones who have some way of recognizing what those mistakes are.

865
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,695
So in this context, let's say I, I just want to see 

866
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:26,980
numerically what my answer turns out to be, right?

867
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,700
We said that it was one half times the natural log of two.

868
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,780
So let's just see what does that end up being?

869
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,534
And natural log of two is around 0.69, so maybe it's not too surprising, 

870
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:39,760
we're around 0.346, around 0.35, okay?

871
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,934
So if we write that down as one of the, as the answer that we just got, 

872
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:48,023
I told you I would purposefully make a mistake, 

873
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:52,980
so hopefully you're not yelling too loud at this point, does that make sense?

874
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,420
Does that pass a basic reasonability test?

875
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,587
And if you look at our picture, well, the probability has to be at least a half, 

876
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:02,160
because that's the region where it rounds down to zero.

877
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,407
So certainly it couldn't be the case that the whole thing adds up to be only 0.35, 

878
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:08,900
so there must have been some mistake we had along the way.

879
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,993
Everybody makes silly mistakes, everybody drops a minus sign 

880
00:52:11,993 --> 00:52:15,240
or applies some rule that doesn't quite apply in a circumstance.

881
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,006
You're not going to make, you're not going to 

882
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:20,180
approach perfection by avoiding silly mistakes.

883
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,400
The way to do it is to be able to systematically know when you've, when you've made them.

884
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,143
So always gut check your answer, have like two different 

885
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,080
perspectives that can give you a reasonability check.

886
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,584
In this context, if it inspired us to go and look a little bit 

887
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,974
more carefully at how we were applying things, 

888
00:52:35,974 --> 00:52:39,840
this sum isn't quite the alternating sum that converges to natural log of 2.

889
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,613
In particular, we added the 1, but then we also add one half, 

890
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:46,060
and it's only after that that we start alternating.

891
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,520
It was plus plus, then minus plus, minus plus, on and on.

892
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,288
And you might see this by recognizing we were subtracting all the even numbers here, 

893
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:55,140
but we're subtracting all the odd numbers here.

894
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,300
So it's similar, but it's not the same.

895
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,994
We will be able to use our knowledge, but let me just give this part 

896
00:53:00,994 --> 00:53:04,080
where things actually start alternating a name, something like s.

897
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,152
What this bottom equation is telling us is that when we take 1 minus s, 

898
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:12,437
so that would mean we're subtracting the one half, then we're adding the one third, 

899
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:16,212
then we're subtracting the one fourth, we're flipping all of the signs of 

900
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:20,140
everything beyond that 1, that is the thing that equals the natural log of 2.

901
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,383
Which in turn implies that that remainder of the 

902
00:53:24,383 --> 00:53:27,440
sum looks like 1 minus the natural log of 2.

903
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,560
Okay, so all of that, what does that tell us?

904
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,694
When we plug it into our original expression, it's saying that 

905
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:37,760
the actual answer should not be one half the natural log of 2.

906
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,760
That didn't even pass our basic reasonability test.

907
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,908
Instead, it'll be one half of 1 plus 1 minus the natural log of 2, 

908
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:50,380
which is just 2 minus the natural log of 2.

909
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,040
So does that pass our reasonability check?

910
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,740
What does this actually equal numerically?

911
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,823
You can get a loose approximation in your head if you want, 

912
00:53:58,823 --> 00:54:01,600
or if you want to see more precisely, we can pull up a calculator.

913
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,037
So if we go over here and we're saying, no, no, no, 

914
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:07,880
we don't want the natural log of 2, that was wrong.

915
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,720
2 minus that, maybe 0.653.

916
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,800
Does that pass our basic reasonability test?

917
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,320
Yeah, I think so, right?

918
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,610
0.65, that looks like a reasonable answer to what the area in our diagram was, 

919
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:25,531
because if we looked at that diagram, which was, you know, 

920
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:30,716
we've got one wedge here that's covering 0.5, and then this other one covers, 

921
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:34,105
well, about one sixth, half of a sixth, basically, 

922
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:38,758
because this length was a half minus a third, which makes it a sixth, 

923
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:42,480
and then it's a triangle, so one half base times height.

924
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,160
So that's about a 12th, or 0.083.

925
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,040
And then the rest of it, you know, it's not going to fill a huge amount.

926
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,560
Something around 0.65 seems pretty reasonable.

927
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,364
And so that, you know, we could call that good on our gut check, 

928
00:54:55,364 --> 00:54:57,020
that this is probably the correct answer.

929
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,904
But we could go one level further if we wanted, 

930
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:03,271
because probability questions very often you can kind of cheat and just 

931
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:06,637
see the answer by simulating it, and actually taking a bunch of samples 

932
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,760
and seeing what happens.

933
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,822
So I want to do that actually on this one, just to give us a little bit of confidence 

934
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:16,993
that our answer of 0.65, that there wasn't some other silly mistake that we made along 

935
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:21,020
the way, because everyone knows there certainly are silly mistakes that we can make.

936
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,429
Before I jump to the programming, though, I just want to see if there's 

937
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:27,180
any questions from the audience, and it certainly looks like there are.

938
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,880
So let's see if we can address some of these, get myself out of the way of the questions.

939
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,703
This is like from the book The Chosen, where the rabbi makes 

940
00:55:35,703 --> 00:55:38,160
an intentional mistake in his long speech to test his son.

941
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,480
It is exactly like that, my children.

942
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,720
I just want to test you.

943
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,243
Every time I make a mistake, it was always purposeful, 

944
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:46,060
and I was always doing it just to test you.

945
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,260
All right, keep making more episodes.

946
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,160
Why am I stopping?

947
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:51,520
Two reasons.

948
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,135
You know, the main one, honestly, if I go much longer in this lockdown 

949
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:58,544
without getting a haircut, we're going to have to start filming these in 

950
00:55:58,544 --> 00:56:02,000
the style of like a 1980s music video, just to keep stylistic consistency.

951
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
I'm not up for that.

952
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,630
You know, I think that's just going to be a little bit too much effort, 

953
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,500
so I'll have to wait until whenever it's possible to get a haircut again, then we can go.

954
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,100
Really, though, I also just miss my old content.

955
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,340
I love visualizing stuff.

956
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,780
I've got a long pile of things I want to get to, and you know, the lectures take time.

957
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,900
I might spin up something like this again, might do it on a separate channel.

958
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,200
We'll see what plays out, but I would love to do like a full course where it's a 

959
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,480
little bit more clear exactly what we're going to talk about from beginning to end.

960
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,960
Loosely, I'm thinking like combinatorics would be fun, but don't hold me to that.

961
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,359
And lastly, can you help us understand derangements and the principles 

962
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,380
of inclusion and exclusion, just like combinatorics intuitive?

963
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,740
Yeah, boy.

964
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,940
How much time do we have today?

965
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,820
Tell you what, maybe just a separate video.

966
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,880
If I do the combinatorics course, actually, that would be a perfect example for it.

967
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,841
It takes a little bit too much to describe here, 

968
00:56:55,841 --> 00:57:00,814
but very naturally what you end up with is taking 1 over 1 factorial minus 1 over 2 

969
00:57:00,814 --> 00:57:05,788
factorial plus 1 over 3 factorial minus, and you're doing this alternating sum with 

970
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:07,920
factorials, which is why e pops out.

971
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,652
And if you think of e as fundamentally being the sum of the reciprocals of factorials, 

972
00:57:11,652 --> 00:57:15,160
it doesn't seem crazy surprising that it's related to counting problems in that way.

973
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,940
But for another day, I'll say, because I don't know if we have time today.

974
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,419
Because I would love to just show how you could maybe gut check this programmatically 

975
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:26,956
if you wanted to, because the very last principle I have for problem solving, 

976
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:30,720
for mathematical problem solving, is to learn at least a little bit of programming.

977
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,217
Okay, and the reason here, one, for what we're about to do, 

978
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,863
you can sometimes basically cheat and see what an answer is numerically, 

979
00:57:37,863 --> 00:57:41,260
to see that that verifies how you're thinking about it analytically.

980
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,640
But also, importantly, it forces you to think about things in two separate ways.

981
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,947
Sometimes you can go about it mathematically, but then when you try to make it 

982
00:57:49,947 --> 00:57:54,440
computational, you run into certain walls about like, how are things actually defined?

983
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,660
Or, I don't have infinity available to me, how can I do this in a more approximate way?

984
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,528
Very often when I'm animating things for usual videos, 

985
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:03,532
the piece of math that I'm describing, you know, 

986
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:06,640
it lines up with some way that I'm programming it to give the illustrations.

987
00:58:07,299 --> 00:58:10,335
And when those mismatch, that's actually what's most interesting, 

988
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:13,830
when it's not computationally viable to give a perfect illustration of what 

989
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:14,520
I'm describing.

990
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,423
And I actually think that does make for better problem solving in general, 

991
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:19,340
where you're coming at it from two different angles.

992
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:25,330
So let's just try this out, see if we can understand the probability question we 

993
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:30,840
were just looking at in terms of just, you know, what's the word I'm looking for?

994
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,180
Cheating!

995
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,400
Seeing what it turns out to be.

996
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:40,000
So I'm going to import numpy, which evidently some heathens refer to as numpy, 

997
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,760
which just, I just can't, that seems awful to me.

998
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,597
So we can find random numbers if you just call random, 

999
00:58:47,597 --> 00:58:51,820
this first random refers to the library, the second one is a function.

1000
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,720
It will return a number between 0 and 1 according to a uniform distribution.

1001
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,056
So it is as likely to choose something between, you know, 

1002
00:59:00,056 --> 00:59:03,459
0.1 and 0.2 as it is to choose something between 0.8 and 0.9.

1003
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,324
And what's nice is I can get a list of them, so in this case I get a list of 10 random 

1004
00:59:08,324 --> 00:59:12,560
numbers, and maybe I call that something like x, and maybe I create another list of y.

1005
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,109
So x, some random numbers, y, some random numbers, 

1006
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:19,740
and if I take x divided by y, it does it term by term.

1007
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:24,396
So for example this first number that we see in here, 

1008
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:28,520
that's 0.739, that's taking the 0.52 divided by the 0.7.

1009
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,605
This next one is taking 0.66 divided by 0.56 on and on, 

1010
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:33,920
so we can see all of our ratios like that.

1011
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:40,025
And in general I might just define a ratios list where I'm going to take my, 

1012
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:44,381
a bunch of random numbers of size n, and then divide it by 

1013
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:48,000
another bunch of random numbers of the same size.

1014
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,400
n is not defined, but I'll give it a definition, some nice and big number like a million.

1015
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,060
Okay.

1016
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,406
And now I'm holding on to a million ratios, a million examples of x divided by y, 

1017
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:02,536
where x and y are chosen according to our constraints, 

1018
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:05,040
which is kind of cool if you think about it.

1019
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,485
So, you know, we can see some examples here, some that have come up to zero, 

1020
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:11,842
and some that would round down to zero, some that would round down to two, 

1021
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,080
some that would round down to one, so that's nice.

1022
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,431
And now I can start asking questions, like, you know, 

1023
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:21,473
when is it that I take these ratios, I take the floor function of them, 

1024
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:25,460
not the four, the floor, and I want to know when is that equal to zero.

1025
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,669
This gives me a list of trues and falses, basically saying it is or it isn't zero, 

1026
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:35,775
and if I take the mean of that, which is treating the trues and falses as ones and zeros, 

1027
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:39,520
this tells me the proportion in total that will actually be zeros.

1028
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:43,780
So we expect it to be about a half, and we can verify, yeah, okay, it's about a half.

1029
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:50,600
We could have also asked when is it about two, okay, and it looks like 0.83.

1030
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,172
And remember from our diagram what we were looking for is when when it's in this green 

1031
01:00:56,172 --> 01:00:58,858
region here, when it's in that green triangle, 

1032
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:02,916
which has an area that was a half minus a third, but all times a half, 

1033
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:06,060
because it's one half base times height for a triangle.

1034
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,345
So if we pop back over to our terminal and say, okay, 

1035
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:14,782
if we were looking for one half times the base of that triangle, 

1036
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:20,380
which was a half minus a third, we would expect that proportion to have been 0.83.

1037
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,140
And yeah, it looks like it was about that.

1038
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,466
And we could even answer our actual question, which is to take the floor, 

1039
01:01:26,466 --> 01:01:30,583
and then if I say I want to divide by two and ask when the remainder is zero, 

1040
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:34,911
that's a way of asking when it's even, and then taking that whole list and taking 

1041
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:38,817
a mean of it is a way of asking how often that ends up looking like true, 

1042
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:41,667
what proportion of them give me true, and yeah, 0.65, 

1043
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:44,360
which is about the answer that we were looking for.

1044
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,956
You know, we were looking for something that was too half of two minus the natural log, 

1045
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,100
natural log of two.

1046
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,880
So we have this wonderful way to kind of empirically verify.

1047
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,592
And of course, and most of the times with in-lockdown math that I've pulled up Python, 

1048
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:01,860
I'm just doing relatively simple things numerically.

1049
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,180
If you wanted to, you could try to visualize stuff.

1050
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,760
So something like matplotlib is definitely a great pyplot.

1051
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,760
I'll import it as plt.

1052
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,972
This is a very good library for just like simple data 

1053
01:02:14,972 --> 01:02:17,540
visualization that you can pull up pretty quickly.

1054
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,860
So in our context, I can pull up a histogram.

1055
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:27,380
So I'm going to take a histogram of all of my data, and I have to specify a range.

1056
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,913
So maybe we just want to look at when the, when 

1057
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,520
those values get bucketed in between like 0 and 20.

1058
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,740
So my number of bins is 20.

1059
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:41,800
I was about to sneeze, but I held it in.

1060
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,879
Don't you love when that happens when like a sneeze 

1061
01:02:43,879 --> 01:02:45,220
is coming and you don't have to catch it?

1062
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,800
It just recedes into the darkness because it knows that you're better than the sneeze.

1063
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:50,800
Right.

1064
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,420
Again, I'm more pleased with myself than I should be there.

1065
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,191
And um, I always, you always have to add a relative width on these sorts of histograms 

1066
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,880
because they just look ugly if they're all like side by side, I think sometimes.

1067
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,358
So if I do this, um, and then I show what the plot ends up being, 

1068
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:10,560
I have something that has shown up on my screen, but not your screen.

1069
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,840
So let's pop it on over.

1070
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,140
Yeah, there we go.

1071
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,421
So you can get a sense of, you know, this bar represents all of the ones that 

1072
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,500
rounded down to zero, and you see it's about half of them, about half a million.

1073
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,340
All the ones that rounded down to one, rounded down to two.

1074
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,120
And you can get this, um, this nice sense for what all of your data is.

1075
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,794
Again, just adding that kind of empirical validation 

1076
01:03:28,794 --> 01:03:30,960
on top of whatever you find more analytically.

1077
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,727
And that back and forth I really do think is helpful 

1078
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,980
for more like pure mathematical problem solving.

1079
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,640
So with that, that's actually all that I have for the lesson today.

1080
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,040
Just two quick things that I want to go over before we end things here.

1081
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:49,520
I've been using Desmos a lot to like show graphs of things because I just love Desmos.

1082
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,055
And I'm actually friends with some of the people who work there 

1083
01:03:54,055 --> 01:03:58,180
because quite often a company's people are as delightful as its products.

1084
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,633
And the CEO Eli shared with me the fact that they 

1085
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:04,380
were doing like an art contest among some students.

1086
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,319
And I just wanted to showcase some of, I'm not sure if these are the winners 

1087
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,003
or the finalists of the art contest, but basically in various different 

1088
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:16,198
categories of students who are, I think it was like 12 through 14, 15 through 17, 

1089
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:20,240
or something like that, using like mathematical graphs to try to draw pictures.

1090
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:24,220
Okay, so keep in mind what I'm about to show you are mathematical 

1091
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:28,448
graphs that someone wrote just with an analytic description and they were, 

1092
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:32,000
they were just prompted to create something artistic from that.

1093
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:37,890
Okay, so one of my favorites, and I think this one was from someone named Carrie, 

1094
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:42,940
is two giraffes that just from an artistic standpoint, it's actually quite lovely.

1095
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,271
And then to think through like actually mathematically describing everything 

1096
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:51,238
involved here, it's such a beautiful blend of well, like the creative side of things, 

1097
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:54,560
the artistic side with aesthetics and everything, and the analytic side.

1098
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,820
Another that was, this is just genuinely insane.

1099
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,620
This is by Katsini, is a Bézier Knight.

1100
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,998
So I definitely wanted to highlight this on behalf of the team over at Desmos, 

1101
01:05:06,998 --> 01:05:10,540
where each one of the curves here is described according to something 

1102
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,780
that's called a Bézier curve, very useful for computer graphics.

1103
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,930
It's a kind of cubic parametric term, and they just recreated 

1104
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:21,980
a starry knight in a way that's completely beautiful, I think.

1105
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:28,987
And then the very last one, which is genuinely shocking that you can do with mathematical 

1106
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:34,380
graphs in any way, was a self-portrait by Jared, that's just like genuinely insane.

1107
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,401
I mean, I remember playing around with like a TI-84 and trying to come 

1108
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:40,140
up with little pictures of like a smiley face and things like that.

1109
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,496
So the amount that things have changed in terms of when someone's noodling off 

1110
01:05:44,496 --> 01:05:48,580
with their graphing calculator in class and what they can do truly next level.

1111
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,960
And then at the very end, I just want to say again like a highlighted 

1112
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,420
thank you to Ben Eater and to Cam, who've been extremely helpful with 

1113
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:59,880
the whole series in ways that's like hard to even articulate properly.

1114
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,646
Eater in particular, I mean, he's let me borrow a lot of his equipment and helped 

1115
01:06:04,646 --> 01:06:08,473
out with like figuring out live footage type stuff because that's not something I 

1116
01:06:08,473 --> 01:06:12,440
usually do, which is not even to mention the work on the live stats and live quizzes.

1117
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:17,187
So if you aren't already familiar with his channel, it's simply named Ben Eater, 

1118
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:21,700
like 100% check it out, definitely subscribe to it, try some of the projects.

1119
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,220
He has a very project-oriented way of teaching.

1120
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,400
I think it's absolutely great.

1121
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,780
So cannot emphasize enough how grateful I am in the direction of both of those two.

1122
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,620
And check out the the item pool site where we are going to let 

1123
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,064
you kind of relive the lockdown math experience and have like 

1124
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:41,620
homework and actual challenges associated with each one of them.

1125
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,090
So stay tuned on that and if you're interested in being a beta user of it, 

1126
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,960
there will be forms for how you can reach out to both of them.

1127
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,660
Thank you everyone for joining in the whole series.

1128
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,920
This has been very fun for me, very different for me.

1129
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,040
And I will shortly get back to the more usual videos, which I'm very excited about.

1130
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,308
There's a couple topics that I just think you're thoroughly going to enjoy, 

1131
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,658
especially if you like problem solving stuff like this, 

1132
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:05,840
like really getting into good meaty problem solving.

1133
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,400
That's some of what's on the horizon.

1134
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,960
And with that I will simply say keep loving math and enjoy the rest of your day.

1135
01:07:22,920 --> 01:08:18,560
So Thank you.
