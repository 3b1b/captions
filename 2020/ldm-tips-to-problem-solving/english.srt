00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Welcome back, everybody. It's hard to define exactly what mathematicians mean when they use the phrase problem solving.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
However you go about it, it's going to involve some notion of approaching puzzles that you've never seen before

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,560
and still being able to systematically and creatively find some solution to them.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,400
But that's a weird thing when you think about it because it makes it a very hard thing to teach.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,560
I mean, you can teach someone how to solve one particular problem, maybe even a class of problems, and teach them how to solve another problem.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,000
But how do you teach someone how to approach a problem that they've never seen before and still make progress on it?

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,340
Well, I honestly don't know how, but what I want to do for this lecture is to talk through a couple different problem solving principles.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,080
I've enumerated nine of them in total, and each one we're going to walk through in the context of a specific example.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,120
And I think each one is kind of simple. You'll look at it and you'll nod along thinking, yeah, yeah, of course

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
that's a thing that you should do.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,240
But I would argue that each one is deceptively simple, that you would be shocked at how often you can make very meaningful

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,720
progress in very hard problems just by keeping some of these tips in the back of your mind.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,760
And to give you a little flavor for where we're going to be going today,

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
I want to ask, not as a quiz that I expect you to necessarily be able to solve here on the spot,

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,160
I want to ask you a question that we will be solving later on in the lecture,

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
just so you can have it in the back of your mind, a little thing to mull over,

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,880
and a hard problem that will be fun to tackle when the time comes.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,040
So the question asks, suppose the two numbers are chosen at random from the range 0 through 1,

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,480
and it's done according to a uniform distribution. So maybe you pick like 0.385 and 0.58962 or something like that.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Each one is chosen at random. Suppose p is the probability that the ratio of the first number to the second rounds down to an

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
even number.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,120
So, you know, maybe it rounds down to 0 or it rounds down to 2 or to 4.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,480
And basically it's asking you to guess where is this probability, you know?

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
We'll solve it exactly, we'll get an exact expression.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,360
But just intuitively as you hear the problem and you think of choosing two random numbers between 0 and 1, looking at their ratio,

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,200
what do you think that probability is going to be? We'll return back to this later.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,440
And one thing I want to say is that this whole live quizzing software,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,680
it's something that's being built by some friends of mine, Ben Eater, who many of you may know because of his YouTube fame,

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,600
and then another person who used to work with us at Khan Academy named Cam Christensen.

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
And this is just one small little outcropping of what's actually a much deeper product at play.

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
And I want to give you a little preview of some of the other things that they've been working on that we'll be developing.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,080
So if any of you want to share some of the lectures here or go back and kind of go through the live quizzing experience,

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
if you go to the link that it's in the description, but it's at itempool.com

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,060
slash c slash 3b1b, but you can follow the description.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,600
You can basically watch the lectures in a way where you can do these live quizzes

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,960
along with it and your progress is tracked and you get scores and things like that.

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,840
So as you skip ahead to various different questions, it will skip you to the right point in the video.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,200
And as the video plays forward, you'll also get to,

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,200
yeah, there's just me talking through some problem, you'll also get to whatever the appropriate part of the problem is.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,600
They often have explanations associated with them and hints and things like that.

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,720
And ultimately, if you look back in just a couple days, I'm going to fill out like homework and challenge problems.

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you like challenging problem solving, contest math type stuff, I'm going to put things that are relevant to the lectures in there,

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
which I think should be fun. It's not quite there yet, but definitely check back.

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,440
And I'm sure just over the next couple months there will be more item pool shenanigans going on.

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
If any of you want to use this, maybe to do some live polling in your own

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,840
live classes for teachers who are dealing with the whole remote landscape.

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,200
Or if you have your own streams, anything like that. They are looking for beta users, so feel free to reach out to them.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
It should be available on the website.

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,520
Now let's dive into the actual content, shall we? Some of the nine deceptively simple problem solving tricks.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,480
And before we do, I want to specify that at some point today, in the next hour, I'm going to purposefully make a mistake.

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,720
Okay, and I tell you that for two reasons. One, so that you keep your eye out and you, you know,

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,000
you're a little bit skeptical of each of the claims that I make. And two, so that when I make that mistake and you notice it,

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,480
and you're just, you know, throwing things at the screen, you're getting angry, you're clicking that unsubscribe button,

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,240
you can at least quell a little bit of what you're thinking. So just keep that in mind.

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,320
There will be one very purposeful mistake. Now before we get to the problem solving tip, I want to talk about geometry.

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,760
This is one thing I was hoping to do a little bit more of in this series,

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,120
but this should be just a fun time to give a little example of it.

58
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,600
And in particular, I want to talk about one of my favorite little bits of geometry.

59
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,400
It's not too simple, but it's also not too hard. It's called the inscribed angle theorem.

60
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,240
It comes up way more than is reasonable for a simple little theorem like this to actually come up when you're solving problems.

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,680
Okay.

62
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,040
And basically an inscribed angle of a circle refers to if you have two lines that meet at a point of that circle,

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,640
and what we care about is this little angle in here.

64
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,240
Okay.

65
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
And if you were just studying this, if you're an early mathematician trying to make sense out of this,

66
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,760
you might make a guess that something about this angle is going to be related to the arc of the circle

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
that those lines hit.

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,320
I mean that arc can also be described as an angle of some kind if we draw lines

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,920
from the center of the circle, it makes it a little bit clearer.

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
So I'm just going to draw a couple green lines here,

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and mark that we have a different angle here,

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,640
and maybe I give them names. I'll call this one

73
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,760
theta L for like the large angle, and this one I'm going to call theta S.

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
It's the small angle.

75
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,360
And you might wonder is there a relationship between these two angles? And if so, what is it?

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,720
And for our purposes today, the question is how do you systematically approach a puzzle like this? Find a relationship between these two,

77
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
and prove, prove its existence.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
So problem solving tip, not problem sip,

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
problem solving tip number one, which is just,

80
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
just so useful in a way that again is kind of deceptively simple.

81
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
Make sure you're always using the defining features of whatever your setup is.

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,840
I swear a good 70 percent of the problem sets that I did as an undergraduate math major

83
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,920
essentially came down to looking at what was given, asking very critically

84
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,200
what is the definition of each term involved here, unraveling those definitions, and then just seeing how they piece together.

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
So use whatever's the defining feature. In our context,

86
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
what is defining the various points and intersections that we have here?

87
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,120
Well, it's the idea that they're on a circle. A circle is by definition all of the points that are a common distance from the center.

88
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,480
So in particular, we know that this length is a radius of the circle, and this length is a radius of the circle.

89
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,240
We should use the fact that those are the same. But moreover, this other point P, that was not just chosen at random,

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
it's defined to be on the circle.

91
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,040
And unraveling what that means, it means it is a common distance away,

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,240
and is the same distance away from the center as these other points.

93
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,240
So I, uh, am then inspired to draw a line to add something to the picture and to note that it's the same there.

94
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,280
You know, quite often when you see people solve hard geometry problems,

95
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
it comes down to adding something to the picture.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,020
And the most beautiful geometry involves adding something that seems out of left field and it just illuminates everything, you shift your perspective.

97
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,360
And sometimes you look at it and you wonder like, how would you have known what to add?

98
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
Like again, I'm supposed to draw an extra circle here or, um,

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,240
put a, you know, put a rectangle around this triangle, whatever it is you're doing.

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,040
But how do you, how do you systematically know what you should add?

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,760
So in this context, if it relates to the definition of your objects, probably a good idea. And that line actually will be helpful to us.

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
We can start giving a couple things names.

103
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
That's something that, again, maybe it shouldn't even be described as a tip,

104
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,480
but I've put it down as number two, that when you give things meaningful names, that actually helps you move forward in your problem.

105
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,760
And in this context, it might seem like an innocuous thing.

106
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,120
I'll call this little angle that we formed with our radius alpha and this little angle beta.

107
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
And just to see if that, um,

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,760
helps us move forward, you know, recognizing if alpha and beta show up elsewhere, rather than me telling you, I would like you to tell me

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,080
in the context of our next quiz question. So before I answer that probability one for you, I'm going to pull up

110
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,960
question number two for today. We've got a diagram, essentially what we just drew,

111
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
the dot in the middle is the center of the circle, and I've labeled seven different angles.

112
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,280
I've just labeled them a through g, and what I want you to do is tell me which of these equations is true.

113
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
One possibility is that

114
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
four of the angles, a, b, d, and e,

115
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,840
have a sum that's the same as c plus f plus g,

116
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,840
which, just looking at c, f, and g, that would be 360 degrees, right?

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,760
The other is that a is equal to b and d is equal to e.

118
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
Another possibility is that c is equal to f,

119
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,760
and then maybe it's all of those or maybe it's none of those.

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,960
And it looks like we already have strong strong consensus on this one with 360, 400, just a strong

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
large number of people coming in agreeing what they believe the right answer is.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,680
And, you know, if you if you want to be involved, the place to go, 3b1b.co

123
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
live, that redirects you to an item pool page so that you can follow along. And for those who are watching in the future,

124
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,160
maybe you're watching it in the embedded page where the problem is just sitting right below you. And even if you're not technically

125
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,540
participating in the data contributing to the live statistics,

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
when I was going through it, it's honestly pretty fun to just kind of click and like, oh,

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
I know I'm not a part of this, but it kind of feels like I am a part of what was happening.

128
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
So I just love it.

129
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,640
All right, so because there's such strong consistent- consensus, I feel comfortable grading this. Oh, I thought I got it right on 1 1 1 1.

130
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
So the correct answer is that a is equal to b, d is equal to e,

131
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,840
and then none of the others are necessarily true.

132
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
And let's let's walk through why that's the case, okay?

133
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,840
It comes down to exactly what we just highlighted, that these radii are common, which means, you know,

134
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,880
let me just give more things names. Let's call this point a,

135
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
and this point b.

136
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,400
Maybe that's confusing because I was just naming angles a and b, but separate context, separate picture, you know what I mean.

137
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,620
The triangle a, p, and then the center of the circle, that's isosceles.

138
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,540
You know, there's this symmetry about, I could even draw the little axis of symmetry, and that tells us that this is also alpha.

139
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,460
Likewise,

140
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,460
the triangle up here is isosceles, and that tells us that this has an angle of beta.

141
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,140
And what we just did, in effect, is leverage a little bit of symmetry. In this case,

142
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:40,020
it was innocuous, but quite often looking for symmetry in much harder setups, it's super generalizable and it definitely will

143
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,580
help you move forward. If you recognize that there's something symmetric, use that symmetry in some way, which is effectively what we've just done.

144
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,180
Giving things a couple more names, I might want to call this angle,

145
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,020
I'll call it something related to the alphas, so maybe I just call it alpha prime,

146
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,460
and similarly this angle over here is beta prime.

147
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,860
And by noting those facts, I have everything I need to do to draw a connection between

148
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,060
this small angle and this large angle.

149
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,220
You essentially just write down the facts that we have based on the triangles we're looking at.

150
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,880
So the triangle with all of the alpha angles, the sum of those angles has to be 180 degrees,

151
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,620
and there's two different alphas in there, and then there's an alpha prime.

152
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,380
And instead of writing 180 degrees, of course, we like radians, so I'm going to say that equals pi radians.

153
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,700
Similarly, the one with all of the betas tells us that if we take 2 times beta and we add beta prime,

154
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,340
that's also pi.

155
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,460
And then the other fact that we have that's just popping right out from the image

156
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,300
is that alpha prime, beta prime, and theta l add up to 360 degrees, or 2 pi.

157
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,140
So just writing down all of the relevant facts that we have,

158
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,300
now we have some objects that we can manipulate and work with to draw some kind of conclusion, which again,

159
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,300
we're looking for a connection between theta small and theta large. And I know a lot of you, your three blue and brown audience

160
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
members, you know about the inscribed angle theorem,

161
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,660
but I really want you to think about this from a beginner's mind, right?

162
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,620
If you were just approaching this and you didn't necessarily already know about it,

163
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,020
what would you have done to find that solution? And what principles can you take away as you do that?

164
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,300
Because that helps us as we start to get to harder and harder geometry setups.

165
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,860
So in this context, once I have these three equations,

166
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,180
recognizing that there's an alpha prime here and one here, there's a beta prime here and one here, I might think about canceling them out.

167
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,280
So I'm going to, you know, add this top equation and maybe I've subtract off the other two equations.

168
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,980
And to subtract these off, and what that means is the alpha prime gets cancelled, so does the beta prime, I'm left with

169
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,980
my large angle,

170
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
I'm subtracting off two times

171
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
alpha plus beta,

172
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,140
you know, each of those gets subtracted off with the coefficient two, and then we have two pi minus two copies of pi.

173
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,260
So that's all equal to zero, which is saying the same thing

174
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,060
as theta l is equal to two times, well rather than writing alpha plus beta,

175
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,100
I'll just recognize that that is the small little angle that we had.

176
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
It's two times the small angle.

177
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,380
Again, I can't emphasize enough just what a weirdly useful fact this turns out to be in various geometry puzzles you might do.

178
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,700
It's definitely come up on the channel a number of times

179
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,700
in circumstances regarding, you know, complex numbers or pure geometry situations, of course.

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,540
Just

181
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,420
anytime you want to relate an angle to two times that angle,

182
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,780
realizing them in the context of a circle like this

183
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,460
can be strangely useful. So this is just an image to have burned in your mind as you're solving problems.

184
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,340
And to give you one example of a problem that you can solve once this is sitting there, burned in the back of your

185
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,380
mind, I want you to remember back to the lecture that we did on trigonometry, which conveniently

186
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,780
it's actually the example that I had pulled up here. So one of the central things we were talking about was how

187
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,220
just playing with graphs you can get this bizarre looking fact that if you square the cosine function,

188
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,580
you get something that looks, again, just like a cosine graph.

189
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,660
And you can get more exact about that, where if we start with an initial cosine graph

190
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,020
and you manipulate it a little, you know, we shift it up, we scale it down,

191
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,020
we say we need to double the frequency, you get the exact same graph.

192
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,380
So we have two different expressions for the same thing, but it's not at all obvious why these would be related.

193
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,740
One of them involves doubling the angle it's a reference to, the other involves squaring the output.

194
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,380
Okay, so it's a not obvious fact. We proved it using complex numbers, but what I'd like to do is try to prove this using

195
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,100
geometry, to kind of viscerally see the fact pop out right in front of us.

196
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,580
And to do that,

197
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,980
let's go ahead and write down what the fact is again so that we can start thinking about it.

198
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,140
We want to find that the cosine squared of theta,

199
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,300
which is just saying take the cosine of theta and square it, it's that awkward notation,

200
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
is equal to one half

201
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,300
of

202
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
one plus

203
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:56,500
cosine of two theta. You've got the strange relationship between squaring things and doubling the angle, which as we've talked about in the whole series is

204
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,060
really a reflection of the fact that a cosine is a shadow of an exponential function.

205
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,440
But let's say you didn't know that, we want to see it viscerally and geometrically,

206
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,660
so you don't already know the double angle identities or anything like that. You just want a very direct understanding of this particular equation.

207
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Well, one common thing that comes up

208
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,060
is that a way to show the two non-obvious things are related or even equal

209
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,540
is to see if you can find one object that you can describe in two different ways.

210
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,100
So we're going to look for one object that we have two different descriptions of,

211
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,020
and this often can give you nice equations in this context. It might mean

212
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,940
relating the left and right hand side. This comes up in combinatorics all the time when you have a counting puzzle where,

213
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,940
you know, you do something like count how many ways you can have a string of five bits that are either zeros or ones.

214
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,780
And on the one hand you can count it multiplicatively kind of going through each one and saying well,

215
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,020
you're multiplying the possibilities by two. But on the other hand you can go iteratively and say,

216
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,460
well, how many of them have no ones? How many of them have one one, two ones?

217
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,020
Something that kind of seems harder and a more awkward way to count.

218
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,900
But by describing the same thing twice you end up with this really not obvious fact from an algebraic standpoint.

219
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,460
And we're going to do the same thing more geometrically here.

220
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,380
But again, just got to emphasize how like, how general this ends up being.

221
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,040
So what we want is some kind of object that each of these describes.

222
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,980
And to do that, maybe we just think okay, let's

223
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,420
let's draw a unit circle, which is where something like a cosine typically comes up.

224
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,060
Oh, for the first time in my life I drew a quarter circle arc that wasn't terrible. It's not great,

225
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,940
but usually that comes out much more disastrous.

226
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,980
How pleasing.

227
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,860
I should not be so pleased with a terrible quarter circle.

228
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Um.

229
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Great, okay. So that's our angle theta, right? And what does cosine mean in this context? Not cosine squared,

230
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
but just plain vanilla cosine.

231
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,580
Well, it tells us if we look at the x-coordinate of this point,

232
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,780
that's the cosine of our angle.

233
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,420
And so now I want you to think about how can we represent the square of the cosine as some kind of object?

234
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,940
Some geometric thing that we can point to in this image.

235
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,580
And the first instinct might be something like, well, let's draw a square off the side of this, you know, something

236
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,300
with area to it and interpret it like that.

237
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,980
But then there's going to be a problem if the principle that we're trying to apply is describing the same object in two different ways.

238
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,660
Because if we describe this left-hand side as some kind of area,

239
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,300
that would mean that we have to find another description of that same area, that same object, with the right-hand side.

240
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,060
But that's going to be weird because this doesn't involve squaring or anything like that.

241
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:38,260
If it's just a plain vanilla cosine term, it seems much more natural to describe that as some kind of ratio, or maybe some kind of length.

242
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,180
It's just that we need the 2 theta to pop up somehow.

243
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,740
So instead, let's seek a way to describe cosine squared that does not involve area,

244
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,100
but is instead something more of the flavor of a ratio or a length.

245
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,780
And in this context, the key comes down to leveraging symmetry again. And it's a sneaky bit of symmetry.

246
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,540
It's something we did talk about in the trig lecture, but I love it so much I'll talk about it again.

247
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,620
If we think of this angle theta, on the one hand it's telling us the angle between the x-axis and the line,

248
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,780
but on the other hand it's also telling us the angle between the line and the x-axis.

249
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
And I know that sounds like the same thing,

250
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,300
but it means when I say project down the point at the end of our radius, which was length 1,

251
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,900
perpendicularly onto the x-axis,

252
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,020
that length got scaled down by cosine theta. But now what if I do things the other way?

253
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
What if I say I want to project down

254
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
in a perpendicular fashion

255
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,540
onto this line? Well again, I just have two lines separated by an angle theta.

256
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,180
I'm doing a projection, which means it gets scaled down by the cosine of that angle.

257
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,180
So now I'm taking the cosine of theta scaled down by the cosine of theta, and it gets me cosine squared of theta.

258
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,900
So cosine squared refers to this length,

259
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,460
a portion of the hypotenuse of our right triangle.

260
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,300
If that hypotenuse had a length of 1, which in our unit circle it always does.

261
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,700
And incidentally, you can show very similar reasoning that the sine of theta is this other

262
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,540
other portion of that hypotenuse, and this gives you a nice,

263
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,620
sort of a clever proof of the Pythagorean theorem, the idea of double projecting,

264
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,580
based on asking, you know, is this line theta degrees away from that, or is that line theta degrees away from this?

265
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,820
Sounds like you're saying the same thing, but it gets you something of mathematical substance to recognize that symmetry.

266
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:30,340
Now why do I say this? Well, we have a representation of cosine squared. What we want now is to do something in terms of 2 theta.

267
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,700
We just were thinking about a context where we're able to relate an angle to 2 theta, to 2 times that angle.

268
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,860
So somehow we want to realize this angle as an inscribed angle of some kind of triangle.

269
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
And I'll show you how you can do that.

270
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,100
But before I do, just to mention another fact that if you've been puzzling around with these sorts of things,

271
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
might be burning in your mind,

272
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,700
is a specific instance of the inscribed angle theorem called Thales theorem.

273
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:06,580
So let's say that that large angle we had, 2 theta, was actually 180 degrees, right? It was pi radians.

274
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,860
What would that mean in terms of the inscribed angle theorem?

275
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,200
It means that if we take that diameter of the circle, if it's 180 degrees, it's just drawing out a diameter,

276
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
and we have an inscribed angle

277
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,020
with lines that hit either end of that diameter,

278
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,900
then this angle is necessarily half of that.

279
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,900
So what it means is that we can, we can put a right triangle inside a circle, and whenever you do that,

280
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,940
the hypotenuse of the right triangle is exactly the diameter of that circle. It's a very cute fact.

281
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,740
If you wanted another proof of it, that's not just via

282
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:46,660
the inscribed angle theorem, there's another very wonderful leveraging of symmetry that you can do, where basically you take this point and you say,

283
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm going to reflect it through the origin,

284
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,700
reflect it through the center of my circle, and see where I get.

285
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,820
And recognize that reflecting through the center is the same as rotating the whole image 90 degrees.

286
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,500
So if I rotated the image, not 90, 180 degrees,

287
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,580
my other vertex would end up at that same point.

288
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,980
But now what we have is a quadrilateral, and one of the diagonals is a diameter of the circle,

289
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,900
but the other diagonal is also a diameter of the circle, which in particular means they have the same midpoint and they're the same distance apart,

290
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,380
and you can convince yourself a little that implies it must be a rectangle, that could also be a little side homework problem if you wanted to

291
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,300
chase around the relevant angles.

292
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,940
But I think that's a very beautiful way to think about Thales' theorem, that you reflect everything 180 degrees,

293
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,260
and you necessarily conclude it must be a rectangle, which means that this is a right angle.

294
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,460
Now for our purposes, what does that mean? Well, we've got a right triangle sitting here that's from zero,

295
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,060
we've got one of the points here, another point on the circle. Let's inscribe that in a separate circle, okay?

296
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,740
So I'm going to take a copy of that triangle, but I'm going to,

297
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,960
instead of making the hypotenuse a radius of the circle, I'm going to make that hypotenuse

298
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
a diameter of the circle.

299
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,540
So this is still going to be an angle of theta,

300
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,100
sitting right here.

301
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:11,060
The, uh, basically I flipped it around, so previously it was here, but I flipped it around so that my 90 degree angle is sitting up

302
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,540
and to the right, rather than sitting down here.

303
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,940
The length that we care about is what happens when we project from the point at that 90 degree angle

304
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,320
in a perpendicular fashion down onto the hypotenuse,

305
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
which now looks like this.

306
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
And what we care about is this

307
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
long length, okay?

308
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,580
And actually, let me ask you as a live quiz,

309
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,260
to see if you can come up with an expression for that length in the context of the diagram that we're now looking at.

310
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,700
So, pulling up our quiz again, congratulations to everyone who got this one correct.

311
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,780
Let me give you a little bit of time to think about this one, because this is, uh, this is kind of a heart,

312
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,980
part of the heart of

313
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,860
this particular proof, and I think it's very, very pleasing to see.

314
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,260
So it specifies that the hypotenuse of the large right triangle above has a length of one.

315
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,780
And our context is because it came from the hypotenuse of the triangle drawn in a unit circle,

316
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,900
so the hypotenuse has a length of one, what is the length l

317
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,580
in terms of theta? Okay, so can you find an expression for l in terms of theta?

318
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,180
And I'll give you a little bit of, uh, a little bit of time for that,

319
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,760
bring back our pause and ponder music, get myself a chance to take a drink.

320
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
So,

321
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,180
once again, it looks like we have some strong consensus for today.

322
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,660
So while answers are rolling in, before I grade it,

323
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,460
I'm just going to go ahead and start describing how it goes, since it seems like a lot of you are already well ahead of me.

324
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,460
It's fun to have though.

325
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,260
So of course, we're going to use the inscribed angle theorem. That is the whole reason

326
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,260
I'm bringing it up here. It's a way to relate a single angle to twice that angle.

327
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,300
So in this context, I would draw some lines from the center

328
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,700
of my,

329
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,980
uh, of my new smaller circle that has radius only one half,

330
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
and recognize that this is 2 theta.

331
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,380
And this is just lovely now, isn't it? Because what is the length we care about?

332
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,060
Part of it, excuse me, part of it is the radius,

333
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
which is one half,

334
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,380
but then

335
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,420
the projection down according to 2 theta onto this remaining leg

336
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,260
ends up being that radius one half times the cosine of 2 theta.

337
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,580
And of course that's exactly what we want it to be. We've got the whole radius, which is one half, and then

338
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:55,060
we're multiplying that by 1 plus the cosine of 2 theta. It's a radius of the circle times a scaled down version of that radius.

339
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,940
So that's two different ways of viewing the same object,

340
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,380
which is what we get when we take this right triangle and we project down and look at

341
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,980
what part of the hypotenuse that cuts off. And it gives us this non-trivial relationship in trigonometry between

342
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,020
the cosine squared and the cosine of 2 theta. The fact that otherwise we were going into like complex numbers and

343
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,180
exponentials to understand. So I think that's quite beautiful. I think that's just, um,

344
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,500
one of the many many instances of where the inscribed angle theorem suspiciously slow- just suspiciously shows up.

345
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,860
And again, what I want you to take away is this principle that if you can have one object described in two different ways,

346
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:38,340
very powerful in terms of showing non-obvious algebraic relations or anything that's kind of written down symbolically without immediate intuition on top of it.

347
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:44,260
So with all of that, let's actually turn to the probability question that I asked at the beginning of the lecture.

348
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
So going back to our live quiz,

349
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,620
uh,

350
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:58,900
I will go ahead and grade- well we we all know know the correct answer. So for those of you- wait a minute.

351
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,740
Oh, it was marked incorrectly. Oh, that's my bad.

352
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,740
No, I just slipped this one in like last minute before the lesson today.

353
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,180
Um, so I I might have like swapped around what the answers were. So, uh,

354
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,020
well, it looks like 1380 of you were absolutely wrong according to whatever jerk wrote this quiz.

355
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,660
So

356
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,300
I don't know how that shows up on the user interface if it's like shocking red like oh no, but uh,

357
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,700
D was the actual correct answer here. So congratulations to those of you who got that. Now back to our probability question.

358
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
I'm curious to see what people

359
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,260
said on this one just in terms of their instincts. So this one we had a little bit more of a spread and

360
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:45,140
ah, interesting here the actual correct answer does show up quite a bit, quite a bit lower than- and

361
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,020
now I'm questioning myself to make sure that I've actually, um,

362
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,020
written the thing appropriately.

363
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,520
So just as a reminder of what the question is, we're choosing two random numbers from the range zero through one, each according to a uniform distribution.

364
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,180
And we're we're guessing what the probability that they round down,

365
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,260
the ratio of these numbers rounds down to an even number. Remember zero is an even number,

366
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,380
so that it rounds down to zero or two or four or anything like that.

367
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:14,100
Now this is a tricky problem to think about and uh, definitely no no fault at all for uh,

368
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,180
anyone who isn't immediately able to see roughly where it should be.

369
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,740
But I think um, with a with a little bit of progress on our way even before we get the exact solution,

370
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,060
we can get to a point where you might be able to

371
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,020
intuitively give some kind of ballpark estimate.

372
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,580
So what have we got here?

373
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,820
Choosing two random numbers between zero and one. I think that's a weird thing to think about,

374
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:42,260
especially if you're not familiar with probability that well or when the phrase uniform distribution is thrown up if it's not clear what that means.

375
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Um, but essentially

376
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,340
uh, it's what you would expect where you're choosing some random point on this line

377
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,420
and the idea is that each point is as likely as another or more specifically a given range of points of a certain size

378
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,500
um, should have a given probability that's independent of where that range showed up. It's only dependent on its size.

379
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,580
You know, so you might have in the back of your mind the idea that we've chosen two points,

380
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,980
they're each somewhere between zero and one and

381
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,820
just to give an example of what we mean by uniform distribution the probability that x sits between

382
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,140
0.3 and like 0.5

383
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:24,660
because it's going to be somewhere between zero and one and the length of that range is 0.2, about a fifth of

384
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,180
the entire length it could have come from. What it means to be uniform is that

385
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,580
that probability is actually just the length of the segment that it came from.

386
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:40,020
Now, one thing you might ask is well, what if what about the probability that it's precisely 0.3 or precisely 0.5?

387
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,500
Would it matter if we made these less than or equal to signs?

388
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:49,780
And the answer is it doesn't actually matter because the probability of hitting any specific value on a real number line ends up being zero.

389
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,140
This is a thing many find very confusing. How can a probability of an event that's possible,

390
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,740
it's definitely possible to hit 0.3 have probability zero. Made a whole video about it trying to describe this,

391
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,980
but really what it comes down to is that the things that have probability you should think of ranges.

392
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,380
Those are the fundamental objects and it doesn't really matter how we treat the boundary and just think in terms of ranges.

393
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,220
Even still though what we're asking is a very bizarre question, which is

394
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
if we take the ratio of x and y

395
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:29,060
and we round that down, which sometimes you know mathematicians write using this floor function saying we find the greatest integer smaller than that,

396
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,220
how do we know if that's an even number? That's a weird thing to think about. It's a hard problem in that way.

397
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
So, you know if you think through the principles here,

398
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,300
it's kind of like use the defining features of the setup.

399
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,580
Well, not clear how to use the fact that it's a uniform distribution. I guess we'll be using lengths in some way

400
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,820
to yield probabilities. So maybe that gives us some geometry, but that's not really helpful. Give things meaningful names,

401
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,660
you know, maybe x and y are meaningful or some something suggestive like that. Symmetry, okay, maybe

402
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,060
you know the idea that choosing x and then y is as likely as choosing y then x, you could use that to conclude that

403
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,700
this ratio x over y is as likely to be above one as it is to be below one.

404
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,740
And that actually does tell you something because if we're wondering how often do you round down to be zero,

405
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,740
right, you can say well x over y is as likely to be,

406
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:23,540
x is as likely to be bigger than y as y is likely to be bigger than x. So there's a 50-50 chance that this should happen.

407
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
This would be

408
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,940
probability of 50%.

409
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,300
So that gets you somewhere, which is kind of nice, but it's not clear how you would apply that to things like even numbers,

410
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
same object two different ways, unclear.

411
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
So principle number five here

412
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,660
is where we're going to come in.

413
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,260
Again, it seems simple. It's something that you can not be like, yeah, yeah drawing pictures,

414
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,540
it helps to think through what I'm looking at. But really when you find yourself struggling with some setup

415
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,140
that's not already visual or pictorial, you know, it doesn't have to be making it geometric, but just having some kind of sketch

416
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,980
to

417
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,420
give meaning to your terms can be very helpful. And as a more specific problem solving tip, when you have some numbers,

418
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,660
multiple different numbers, see if you can make them coordinates in some space.

419
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,780
So rather than thinking about x and y as separate things here, we'll want to think about a single point with xy coordinates.

420
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,660
And what that does for us is it actually turns the whole problem two-dimensional in a very helpful way.

421
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,660
So first of all, I've lost track of my straight edge,

422
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
which, where have you gone little straight edge?

423
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,780
I can only throw you so far. Oh, here we go.

424
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
Things, they run away from you.

425
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,420
Even your objects sometimes get tired of math class and want to play truant now and then,

426
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
but he has to stay

427
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
whether he likes to or not.

428
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,820
All right.

429
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
All right, absurd. So

430
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
let's say this is our x coordinate.

431
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,900
x can fall anywhere between 0 and 1 with uniform probability.

432
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,080
y can fall between 0 and 1. So when we have a pair of numbers, you know, something like 0.2,

433
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
what is that, maybe like 0.8,

434
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,740
pair of numbers, it's just a single point in this diagram.

435
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,820
And now to choose both of those numbers uniformly at random means that we're choosing a random point inside a square.

436
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
A square with side length 1.

437
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:19,700
And now maybe we can make a little bit of progress, because it's going to come down to some view of what's going on in

438
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,140
this square.

439
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,180
Now with this specific example, if we're thinking about the ratio x over y,

440
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,140
and taking its floor,

441
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
taking, just rounding it down,

442
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:36,420
well, that's 0.2 over 0.8. That's going to round down to 0, so this would end up being even.

443
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,960
And like I just said, that that happens with 50% probability.

444
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,600
But let's see if we can try to find a way of thinking about that that generalizes up to other examples. And

445
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,400
again, one very useful thing, if you get stuck,

446
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,800
that I have enumerated down here as principle number six,

447
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,200
is to ask a simpler variant of the problem. You're solving something, it's hard. It's too hard.

448
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,120
See if you can make it simpler in a way that you actually can solve and get some kind of foothold.

449
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,980
Maybe that means loosening the constraints of the problem in some setups, or maybe it means looking at a sub-problem.

450
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,720
So in our context, rather than asking the probability that it rounds down to be even,

451
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:20,280
let me just ask the probability that it becomes one, but I want you to answer it in a geometric way, okay? Something that will

452
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,880
generalize to rounding to other things, because the next simpler question might be probability that it rounds down to two, and things like that.

453
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,000
You know where this is going to go. We're going to do it as a live quiz, because

454
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,600
rather than me answering things, I want you guys to answer things for me.

455
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,880
So jumping up to question number four at this point,

456
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
it's going to give us a couple different diagrams.

457
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:48,520
Okay, we've got a, b, c, and d, and it's asking us which of these four regions corresponds to values of x and y,

458
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,240
where taking the floor of x divided by y is equal to zero,

459
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,760
which is to say you take the ratio, you round it down, you get zero. Which region corresponds to that fact?

460
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So,

461
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you

462
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,960
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and lock in answers, but if you want to keep thinking about it,

463
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,400
definitely feel free to pause the video and do so, I don't want to rush anyone.

464
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,420
So, looks like

465
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,260
1265 of you,

466
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,600
1273, always answers rolling in at the end,

467
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,560
correctly answered that it's c, and let's take a moment to think about why that's the case.

468
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,440
Okay, you can do so just with a pile of examples, and just see which ones seem to fall in a region or not,

469
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,240
but let's see if we can understand this in a way that

470
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,000
lets us make progress onto the other even numbers.

471
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,080
So when we say that it rounds down to zero, what we're basically saying is that that ratio sits somewhere between zero and one.

472
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,560
And it's awkward to think of x divided by y, we kind of like to think of y in terms of x,

473
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
so if I multiply everything by y,

474
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,760
which is okay to do with these inequalities because y is always positive,

475
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,800
so that's not going to affect whether the inequality flips one way or another, I multiply everything by y,

476
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,860
and we're basically asking when is x less than y, and whenever you see an inequality,

477
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,200
the boundary of that region is going to be described by the equality, so we're going to wonder when is it the case that y equals x?

478
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,340
Well, that's just a straight line that goes diagonally. If we draw our line y equals x,

479
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,960
that's what we get.

480
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,120
Now that's the boundary of our region, and to know whether we should look to the left of it or to the right of it,

481
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,200
either you can think very directly and say well, you know, y should be greater than x,

482
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,880
so at a given point we want to move upward in the positive y direction.

483
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,280
You could look at a specific example like this, but however you do it, you'll draw the conclusion that

484
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:19,240
geometrically the region of points such that x divided by y rounds down to zero is this sort of grilled cheese cut of our diagram.

485
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,320
So with that,

486
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,760
maybe you can start to think about the harder variant, which is when is it that x divided by y

487
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
rounds down to be two?

488
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,480
And again,

489
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I don't want to answer it. I want you to answer it.

490
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,840
When is it that x divided by y

491
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,240
inside our unit square of points x comma y

492
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,680
rounds down to two? And we've got four possible

493
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,160
geometric regions that this could correspond to, a, b, c, and d,

494
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,360
and really, you know, rather than just thinking about which of these is it, really try to think through

495
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,920
why it's the case and how you can prove that one of these boundaries is actually what it's supposed to be. For example,

496
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,520
I want it to be the case that if I didn't show the correct answer here,

497
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,560
let's say I was just trolling with everyone and I didn't show the correct answer,

498
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,680
you would be able to confidently come and say like, no, I'm quite positive that the correct answer is nothing that you've shown here.

499
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,880
See if that's the level of reasoning that you can put behind it.

500
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,260
So again, I'll give you give you a little moment to think about that.

501
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
So

502
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
so

503
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,040
Okay, so once again, I'm going to lock in answers potentially earlier than you want me to, but keep the lesson moving forward.

504
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
No hard feelings if things haven't

505
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,560
clicked yet, because hopefully the explanation will make them do so. So the correct answer is c,

506
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,120
which it looks like most of you got, and let's go ahead and think through why that's the case.

507
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,240
Very similar reasoning to what we were just doing. The idea is that rather than thinking about this ratio

508
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,200
and a floor, which is kind of a kind of an awkward thing, let's explicitly write out the inequality

509
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,160
this is referring to. It's saying that x divided by y

510
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,200
is greater than or equal to 2 if it's rounding down to that, but it's not greater than 3, so it's less than 3.

511
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,040
And, you know, again, it's a little bit awkward to think of this ratio. So let's write that as 2 times y

512
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
is less than or equal to x,

513
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
which is less than or equal to 3 times y.

514
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Now quite often we don't think of

515
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,760
y as a function of x, we think of x as a function of y, if that makes you feel more comfortable.

516
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,160
So if you want in the back of your mind, you can kind of think 2y less than or equal to x.

517
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,960
Well, that's the same thing as saying y is less than or equal to x halves. And same deal, 3y

518
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,920
being greater than x, that's the same thing as saying y is greater than x divided by 3.

519
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,280
Because that way we can look at the equalities associated with each of these. The line y equals x halves,

520
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,160
which has a slope of one half, you can think of it as intersecting at the point where y equals one half when x equals 1.

521
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,760
So it'll be a line like this that describes part of the boundary of our region.

522
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,760
And the other line is when y is equal to x thirds.

523
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,160
So we know we actually have to be above this line that I'm about to draw,

524
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,120
where one of these represents

525
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,960
x over 2,

526
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,800
and one of these represents

527
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,160
x over 3.

528
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,760
And then part of the

529
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,340
part of the intrusion into the space of my last inequality.

530
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,600
All right, so we want to be above the x equals x over 3 below the x divided by 2.

531
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
This region here

532
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,400
shows us everything where rounding down gets to 2. And I want you to appreciate how

533
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,360
this is a kind of complicated thing to think about if we hadn't gone into a picture

534
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,880
that involves two dimensions. If you were just thinking of x and y

535
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,080
varying along this line and wondering when is it the case that x is more than twice,

536
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,600
or y is more than two times what x is. No, yeah, sorry.

537
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,440
x is more than two times what y is, but it's not three times more than what y is.

538
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
It's not, not, no, I said it wrong.

539
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,560
I said it wrong.

540
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,880
When y is more than two times what x is, but it's not three times more than x is.

541
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,520
It's very, it's very easy to get confuddled in that way.

542
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,920
And it's even harder to try to

543
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,440
give some sort of probability to that, whereas in our diagram it has a very clear meaning. It is the area of this region

544
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,400
because the full area of possibilities already is 1, so

545
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,320
this, the

546
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
probability of something happening should be 1,

547
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
and we just need to look at the area of that.

548
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,120
And now maybe you can see where this is going to go, because for the next term when we want to know

549
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
when does x divided by y

550
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
sit between 4

551
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,240
and 5,

552
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,080
we're going to be drawing lines

553
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,000
that intersect at x over 4. Maybe I'll go to a different color for this one.

554
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,520
x over 4 and x over 5,

555
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,200
which is going to require very small handwriting at this point, but I'm going to give it a try nevertheless.

556
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
x fourths,

557
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,440
y equals x fifths, and this little sliver of area

558
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,760
gives us all of the times that our ratio x over y rounds to be 4.

559
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,040
And we're going to have to add infinitely many of these, so that gives us sort of another phase of challenge to the problem.

560
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,320
I've drawn this all out in Desmos, by the way, if you want to just sort of see what some of these regions look like,

561
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,840
where we've got our top region of places where it rounds to zero, then we've got another region

562
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,400
corresponding to rounding to 2, rounding to 4, rounding to 6, and just on and on

563
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
each one of these regions.

564
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,920
Rounding and rounding, rounding. I only went out to like 100 or something like that, but

565
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,680
that gives you a sense of what we're trying to do. So we've made progress, but this is still hard.

566
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,200
What is the area of all of those triangles added together? Right, that's not necessarily an obvious thing.

567
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,880
So

568
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
let's just start by writing it out and seeing

569
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,080
what help that can give us. So every one of these is a triangle,

570
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
it's going to look like one half base times height.

571
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,920
And in fact every one of them, if we think of the left right direction as being their height,

572
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,760
every one of them has a height of 1. So each one is going to look like one half times a base of some kind.

573
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,720
So I'm going to take, maybe I'll write this out on a different piece of paper actually, so I can keep it up close.

574
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,440
I'll take one half

575
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,240
times whatever the base of the triangle is times the height. So our first triangle, that base is,

576
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
that base has a length 1.

577
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,040
So that's going to correspond to the one half probability of going to 0. The next triangle, we have to look at this length here,

578
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,720
between 1 3rd and 1 half. What is that length?

579
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,600
Well, actually I'm just going to write it out as

580
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
a half minus a third.

581
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,480
It equals a sixth, but writing it out like that kind of reminds us where it came from,

582
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
so we don't want to collapse things too soon.

583
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,060
That could maybe be another problem solving tip, don't collapse things too soon. Try to let your notation

584
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,860
have a memory for where things came from, because sometimes that helps see overall patterns.

585
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,620
This next one, what's the distance between these two points? Well, it's a fourth minus a fifth.

586
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,220
That's the distance between these, given how they were defined. So we have a fourth

587
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,780
minus a fifth.

588
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,260
And in general, we have this kind of oscillating sum,

589
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,940
a sixth minus a seventh, where we have all the reciprocals of the natural numbers,

590
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,300
but we're adding that up infinitely many different times, okay, and we want to know what that sum happens to be.

591
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
And from here,

592
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,220
the problem solving tip associated with this will seem a little bit strange, but

593
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:10,540
it might be the case that you recognize this fact from somewhere else. You might recognize, let's say if you were watching a particular

594
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,820
lockdown math lecture a week or two ago,

595
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,700
this alternating sum, one minus a half plus a third minus fourth plus a fifth,

596
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,100
on and on, actually equals the natural log of two.

597
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,420
Okay?

598
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,940
And the way this actually came about, it's such a weird procedure,

599
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,500
it's worth just like walking through again really quickly, because it's a bizarre thing that you're not gonna,

600
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
you're not gonna be able to just stare at this formula,

601
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,740
and then immediately see that this is how you're going to solve it, unless it's something that you've seen before,

602
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,220
which can make it seem all the more opaque.

603
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,540
We did this strange thing where we made it seem like a harder question at first, where rather than asking about

604
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:55,420
one particular sum, we turned it into a function, which is effectively asking about infinitely many different sums like this.

605
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
So x to the fourth over four,

606
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:05,020
then we're adding x to the fifth over five. And the reason for doing this is that this plays nicely in calculus land,

607
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,900
because those denominators are now related to the exponents in a way that we can kind of cancel out by doing an integration trick,

608
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:18,540
each one of those terms I can nicely express as an integral of a much more simple monomial term.

609
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,340
x cubed

610
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,380
minus,

611
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,820
now let's see, plus

612
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,500
x to the fourth.

613
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:31,660
If I integrate this thing, each one of them has an exponent that increases, and then we divide by what the exponent is.

614
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,780
And the reason that you would want to do this

615
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
is that this now has a nice

616
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,980
way to collapse itself.

617
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,900
So just to make this maybe more explicit, if we evaluate the integral from zero to one,

618
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,420
that's the same as taking this whole expression and evaluating it at one and subtracting at zero.

619
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,900
So that will give us what happens when we plug in at one.

620
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,860
And again, this is just such a bizarre thing that

621
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,380
if you hadn't recognized the sum, seeing someone prove it to you like this

622
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,660
doesn't necessarily make it feel like something that you could have found,

623
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:08,380
which is frustrating in the context of trying to develop problem solving tips that are generalizable. But I'll keep walking through it just to

624
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:15,440
give a little bit of closure to this. We've got this infinite sum that if you had been familiar with geometric

625
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,900
sums, where each term looks like a certain product from the last,

626
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,340
you would be able to write this as 1 over 1 plus x, because we're always multiplying by negative x,

627
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,220
so you always take 1 over 1 minus the thing you're multiplying by,

628
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,740
which again, it's kind of one of these things where it's relying on you recognizing it in some way.

629
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,540
And then the last bit of recognition is knowing how to take integrals of 1 divided by

630
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:43,100
a thing. And in this context, it works out very nicely to just be the natural log.

631
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,340
And we're evaluating this between 0 and 1,

632
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,580
which is to say we're taking the natural log of 1 plus 1, or 2,

633
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,540
minus the natural log of 1, which is 0.

634
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,580
And that's why all of these things are the natural log of 2.

635
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,540
And think about what has to go on there

636
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,140
in order to be able to take this and then apply it to our probability question.

637
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,380
You would have to recognize the alternating sum as something that you had seen from another context,

638
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,360
or if you didn't, you would have to be aware of this trick to somehow turn it into a polynomial

639
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,740
that can be nicely expressed as an integral, that can be collapsed because of geometric series,

640
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,140
which can be integrated because of the natural log of x.

641
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,220
And then thinking about like, what is the thing that you can teach someone to

642
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,580
say come away and be able to solve problems in the same way?

643
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,860
I have what might seem like kind of a facetious tip,

644
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,460
but I actually think it's maybe the most potent one and the most honest one.

645
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,100
The way that you can get to this sort of point,

646
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,740
just read a lot, read as much as you can.

647
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,540
You know, watch YouTube videos on math if they're substantive, things like that, and think a lot about problems.

648
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,300
Which is maybe frustrating because what you want is to be able to say like,

649
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,980
well, how could I have come to this on my own without having nearly recognized it?

650
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,820
But I think the truth of the matter is a lot of what looks like insight and ingenuity

651
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,500
is really just pattern recognition, but wearing a little bit of added clothing.

652
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,980
And sometimes it's patterns not so much that you're directly recognizing exactly this,

653
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,340
but maybe you had seen a series like this or a tactic like this before.

654
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,500
Like geometric series, that comes up a lot. If you read a lot, and if you think a lot about problems,

655
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,980
you will recognize geometric series even if it's in a context that you've never actually seen before,

656
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,460
or a specific geometric series that you've never seen before.

657
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,260
Similarly, if you read a lot and you think a lot about calculus,

658
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,700
knowing that you can have the natural log pop out of an integral like this,

659
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,700
it becomes second nature.

660
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,700
And I think recognizing the truth of this as being the key to a lot of problem solving is actually pretty inspiring.

661
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:38,700
Because oftentimes you find yourself in a situation where somebody is, they're just faster, they're just better,

662
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,700
they just recognize things more so than you do.

663
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
And that can be a little bit intimidating, right?

664
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,700
To look at one problem, think of yourself as pretty savvy with math and knowing what's going on,

665
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,700
and then just having someone burn through with a wonderful bit of cleverness, this super beautiful argument,

666
00:48:52,700 --> 00:49:00,700
that leaves you sitting there in the dust wondering like, wow, I just, you know, I'm just not in the same league at all.

667
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
And you sometimes even think, well, he just has a math gene, right?

668
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,700
That person, they just have some sort of innate instinct that makes them really good at this stuff.

669
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,700
But I think the truth of the matter is that the people who are showing that kind of ingenuity,

670
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,700
they've exposed themselves to a huge number of patterns, and you too could get there, right?

671
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,700
There is a path towards that which takes the form of practice.

672
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:27,700
But not just practice, practice where you're taking each problem that you're looking at and trying to digest the deeper principles behind it.

673
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:33,700
Maybe some of the ones I'm trying to talk through today, like, okay, I can say leverage symmetry, but what does that actually mean?

674
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,700
What does it mean to look at a symmetry of a problem and turn that into something that's formulaically useful?

675
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,700
You just have to see it a lot, and then be pensive when you do.

676
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,700
Don't just be satisfied with the answer, see if you can understand why that answer came out.

677
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:53,700
So in that way, this number seven, like, it's the most frustrating but it's the most real of all the problem solving tips that there can be,

678
00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:00,700
which is that true problem solving comes down to a kind of pattern recognition, and there's no two ways around it.

679
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,700
You just have to do a lot of practice and expose yourself to a lot.

680
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,700
Now I would bet that when we did talk about this infinite series a couple lectures back,

681
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,700
you wouldn't have thought that that's a thing that you're going to be using in a probability question one day.

682
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,700
But that's just how these things go, they show up in unexpected places.

683
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,700
So what you can do then, is say well we've got our whole expression that involves this very alternating sum,

684
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:29,700
and you'd say okay that means that the answer to our final question is, you know, one half of the natural log of two.

685
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:35,700
It's one half of what that alternating sum came out to be, which is very nice, you know, it involves this natural log expression,

686
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:42,700
and it's very clean, and we've got this picture for where it came from adding up all of these, all of these areas.

687
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,700
Now at this point, there is one thing that I think separates really good problem solvers,

688
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,700
the ones who get like nearly perfect scores all the time, to ones who are like merely good,

689
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,700
who, you know, they aren't necessarily perfect scores, there's some like silly mistakes that come in here or there.

690
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,700
At this point, when you've done the problem and you've got your nice elegant solution,

691
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,700
you want to draw a box around it, you're not done.

692
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:09,700
Just always, always, principle number eight here, always gut check your answer.

693
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,700
Okay, because there's going to be some little mistake that happens all the time.

694
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,700
The great problem solvers aren't the ones who just never make little mistakes,

695
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,700
they're the ones who have some way of recognizing what those mistakes are.

696
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:26,700
So in this context, let's say I, I just want to see numerically what my answer turns out to be, right?

697
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,700
We said that it was one half times the natural log of two.

698
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,700
So let's just see what does that end up being?

699
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:39,700
And natural log of two is around 0.69, so maybe it's not too surprising, we're around 0.346, around 0.35, okay?

700
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:45,700
So if we write that down as one of the, as the answer that we just got,

701
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:50,700
I told you I would purposefully make a mistake, so hopefully you're not yelling too loud at this point.

702
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,700
Does that make sense? Does that pass a basic reasonability test?

703
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,700
And if you look at our picture, well the probability has to be at least a half,

704
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,700
because that's the region where it rounds down to zero.

705
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,700
So certainly it couldn't be the case that the whole thing adds up to be only 0.35,

706
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,700
so there must have been some mistake we had along the way.

707
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:14,700
Everybody makes silly mistakes, everybody drops a minus sign or applies some rule that doesn't quite apply in a circumstance.

708
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,700
You're not going to make, you're not going to approach perfection by avoiding silly mistakes.

709
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,700
The way to do it is to be able to systematically know when you've, when you've made them.

710
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,700
So always gut check your answer, have like two different perspectives that can give you a reasonability check.

711
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:34,700
In this context, if it inspired us to go and look a little bit more carefully at how we were applying things,

712
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,700
this sum isn't quite the alternating sum that converges to natural log of two.

713
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:45,700
In particular, we added the one, but then we also add one half, and it's only after that that we start alternating.

714
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,700
It was plus plus, then minus plus, minus plus, on and on.

715
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:54,700
And you might see this by recognizing we were subtracting all the even numbers here, but we're subtracting all the odd numbers here.

716
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
So it's similar, but it's not the same.

717
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:03,700
We will be able to use our knowledge, but let me just give this part where things actually start alternating a name, something like s.

718
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:11,700
What this bottom equation is telling us is that when we take one minus s, so that would mean we're subtracting the one half,

719
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,700
then we're adding the one third, then we're subtracting the one fourth, we're flipping all of the signs of everything beyond that one.

720
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:25,700
That is the thing that equals the natural log of two, which in turn implies that that remainder of the sum looks like one minus

721
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,700
the natural log of two.

722
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:37,700
Okay, so all of that, what does that tell us? When we plug it into our original expression, it's saying that the actual answer should not be one half the natural log of two.

723
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,700
That didn't even pass our basic reasonability test.

724
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:50,700
Instead, it'll be one half of one plus one minus the natural log of two, which is just two minus the natural log of two.

725
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,700
So does that pass our reasonability check? What does this actually equal numerically?

726
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,700
You can get a loose approximation in your head if you want, or if you want to see more precisely, we can pull up a calculator.

727
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:07,700
So if we go over here and we're saying, no, no, no, we don't want the natural log of two, that was wrong.

728
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:13,700
Two minus that, maybe 0.653. Does that pass our basic reasonability test?

729
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:22,700
Yeah, I think so. 0.65, that looks like a reasonable answer to what the area in our diagram was.

730
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:30,700
Because if we looked at that diagram, which was, you know, we've got one wedge here that's covering 0.5,

731
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:42,700
and then this other one covers, well, about one sixth, half of a sixth, basically, because this length was a half minus a third, which makes it a sixth, and then it's a triangle, so one half base times height.

732
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:51,700
So that's about a twelfth, or 0.083. And then the rest of it, you know, it's not going to fill a huge amount, something around 0.65 seems pretty reasonable.

733
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,700
And so that, you know, we could call that good on our gut check, that this is probably the correct answer.

734
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:07,700
But we could go one level further if we wanted, because probability questions, very often you can kind of cheat and just see the answer by simulating it, and actually taking a bunch of samples and seeing what happens.

735
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:20,700
So I want to do that, actually, on this one, just to give us a little bit of confidence that our answer of 0.65, that there wasn't some other silly mistake that we made along the way, because everyone knows there certainly are silly mistakes that we can make.

736
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:26,700
Before I jump to the programming, though, I just want to see if there's any questions from the audience, and it certainly looks like there are.

737
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,700
So let's see if we can address some of these, get myself out of the way of the questions.

738
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:37,700
This is like from the Book of the Chosen, where the rabbi makes an intentional mistake in his long speech to test his son.

739
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:45,700
It is exactly like that, my children. I just want to test you. Every time I make a mistake. It was always purposeful, and I was always doing it just to test you.

740
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,700
I keep making more episodes. Why am I stopping?

741
00:55:50,700 --> 00:56:01,700
Two reasons. You know, the main one, honestly, if I go much longer in this lockdown without getting a haircut, we're going to have to start filming these in the style of like a 1980s music video, just to keep stylistic consistency.

742
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:10,700
I'm not up for that. You know, I think that's just going to be a little bit too much effort, so I'll have to wait until whenever it's possible to get a haircut again, then we can go.

743
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:17,700
Really, though, I also just miss my old content. I love visualizing stuff. I've got a long pile of things I want to get to, and you know, the lectures take time.

744
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:27,700
I might spin up something like this again. I might do it on a separate channel. We'll see what plays out, but I would love to do like a full course where it's a little bit more clear exactly what we're going to talk about from beginning to end.

745
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,700
Loosely, I'm thinking like combinatorics would be fun, but don't hold me to that.

746
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:39,700
And lastly, can you help us understand derangements and the principles of inclusion and exclusion, just like combinatorics intuitive?

747
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:51,700
Yeah, boy. How much time do we have today? Tell you what, maybe just a separate video. If I do the combinatorics course, actually, that would be a perfect example for it.

748
00:56:51,700 --> 00:57:07,700
It takes a little bit too much to describe here, but very naturally what you end up with is taking 1 over 1 factorial minus 1 over 2 factorial plus 1 over 3 factorial minus, and you're doing this alternating sum with factorials, which is why E pops out.

749
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:14,700
And if you think of E as fundamentally being the sum of the reciprocals of factorials, it doesn't seem crazy surprising that it's related to counting problems in that way.

750
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,700
But for another day, I'll say, because I don't know if we have time today.

751
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Because I would love to just show how you could maybe gut check this programmatically if you wanted to, because the very last principle I have for problem solving, for mathematical problem solving, is to learn at least a little bit of programming.

752
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:40,700
And the reason here, one, for what we're about to do, you can sometimes basically cheat and see what an answer is numerically, to see that that verifies how you're thinking about it analytically.

753
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:54,700
But also, importantly, it forces you to think about things in two separate ways. Sometimes you can go about it mathematically, but then when you try to make it computational, you run into certain walls about like, how are things actually defined?

754
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,700
Or, I don't have infinity available to me, how can I do this in a more approximate way?

755
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:06,700
Very often when I'm animating things for usual videos, the piece of math that I'm describing, you know, it lines up with some way that I'm programming it to give the illustrations.

756
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:14,700
And when those mismatch, that's actually what's most interesting, when it's not computationally viable to give a perfect illustration of what I'm describing.

757
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,700
And I actually think that does make for better problem solving in general, where you're coming at it from two different angles.

758
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:33,700
So let's just try this out, see if we can understand the probability question we were just looking at in terms of just, you know, what's the word I'm looking for? Cheating! Seeing what it turns out to be.

759
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:43,700
So I'm going to import numpy, which evidently some heathens refer to as numpy, which just, I just can't, that seems awful to me.

760
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:51,700
So we can find random numbers if you just call random, this first random refers to the library, the second one is a function.

761
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,700
It will return a number between 0 and 1 according to a uniform distribution.

762
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:03,700
So it is as likely to choose something between, you know, 0.1 and 0.2 as it is to choose something between 0.8 and 0.9.

763
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:12,700
What's nice is I can get a list of them, so in this case I get a list of 10 random numbers, and maybe I call that something like x, and maybe I create another list of y.

764
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:19,700
So x, some random numbers, y, some random numbers, and if I take x divided by y, it does it term by term.

765
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:28,700
So, for example, this first number that we see in here, that's 0.739, that's taking the 0.52 divided by the 0.7.

766
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,700
This next one is taking 0.66 divided by 0.56, on and on. So we can see all of our ratios like that.

767
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:47,700
And in general, I might just define a ratios list where I'm going to take my, a bunch of random numbers of size n, and then divide it by another bunch of random numbers of the same size.

768
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:52,700
n is not defined, but I'll give it a definition, some nice and big number, like a million.

769
00:59:53,700 --> 01:00:04,700
And now, I'm holding on to a million ratios, a million examples of x divided by y, where x and y are chosen according to our constraints, which is kind of cool if you think about it.

770
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:13,700
So, you know, we can see some examples here, some that have come up to 0, and some that would round down to 0, some that would round down to 2, some that would round down to 1, so that's nice.

771
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:25,700
And now I can start asking questions, like, you know, when is it that I take these ratios, I take the floor function of them, not the floor, the floor, and I want to know when is that equal to 0.

772
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,700
This gives me a list of trues and falses, basically saying it is or it isn't 0.

773
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:39,700
And if I take the mean of that, which is treating the trues and falses as 1s and 0s, this tells me the proportion in total that will actually be 0s.

774
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,700
So we expect it to be about a half, and we can verify, yeah, okay, it's about a half.

775
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:50,700
We could have also asked when is it about 2, okay, and it looks like 0.83.

776
01:00:50,700 --> 01:01:05,700
And remember, from our diagram, what we were looking for is when it's in this green region here, when it's in that green triangle, which has an area that was a half minus a third, but all times a half, because it's one half base times height for a triangle.

777
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:19,700
So if we pop back over to our terminal and say, okay, if we were looking for one half times the base of that triangle, which was a half minus a third, we would expect that proportion to have been 0.83.

778
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,700
And yeah, it looks like it was about that.

779
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:31,700
And we could even answer our actual question, which is to take the floor, and then if I say I want to divide by 2 and ask when the remainder is 0, that's a way of asking when it's even.

780
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:40,700
And then taking that whole list and taking a mean of it is a way of asking how often that ends up looking like true, what proportion of them give me true.

781
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,700
And yeah, 0.65, which is about the answer that we were looking for.

782
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:50,700
You know, we were looking for something that was half of 2 minus the natural log of 2.

783
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,700
So we have this wonderful way to kind of empirically verify.

784
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:01,700
And of course, and most of the times in lockdown math that I've pulled up Python, I'm just doing relatively simple things numerically.

785
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,700
If you wanted to, you could try to visualize stuff.

786
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:09,700
So something like matplotlib is definitely a great pyplot.

787
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,700
I'll import it as plt.

788
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:17,700
This is a very good library for just like simple data visualization that you can pull up pretty quickly.

789
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,700
So in our context, I can pull up a histogram.

790
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:27,700
So I'm going to take a histogram of all of my data, and I have to specify a range.

791
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:34,700
So maybe we just want to look at when those values get bucketed in between like 0 and 20.

792
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,700
So my number of bins is 20.

793
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,700
I was about to sneeze, but I held it in.

794
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,700
Don't you love when that happens when like a sneeze is coming and you don't have to catch it?

795
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,700
It just recedes into the darkness because it knows that you're better than the sneeze.

796
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,700
Again, I'm more pleased with myself than I should be there.

797
01:02:52,700 --> 01:03:01,700
And you always have to add a relative width on these sorts of histograms because they just look ugly if they're all like side by side, I think sometimes.

798
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:09,700
So if I do this, and then I show what the plot ends up being, I have something that has shown up on my screen, but not your screen.

799
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
So let's pop it on over.

800
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,700
Yeah, there we go.

801
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:19,700
So you can get a sense of, you know, this bar represents all of the ones that rounded down to 0, and you see it's about half of them, about half a million.

802
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,700
All the ones that rounded down to 1, rounded down to 2.

803
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,700
And you can get this nice sense for what all of your data is.

804
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:30,700
Again, just adding that kind of empirical validation on top of whatever you find more analytically.

805
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:35,700
And that back and forth I really do think is helpful for more like pure mathematical problem solving.

806
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,700
So with that, that's actually all that I have for the lesson today.

807
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,700
Just two quick things that I want to go over before we end things here.

808
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:49,700
I've been using Desmos a lot to like show graphs of things because I just love Desmos.

809
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:58,700
And I'm actually friends with some of the people who work there because quite often a company's people are as delightful as its products.

810
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:04,700
And the CEO, Eli, shared with me the fact that they were doing like an art contest among some students.

811
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:09,700
And I just wanted to showcase some of, I'm not sure if these are the winners or the finalists of the art contest,

812
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:16,700
but basically in various different categories of students who are, I think it was like 12 through 14, 15 through 17, or something like that,

813
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,700
using like mathematical graphs to try to draw pictures.

814
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:27,700
So keep in mind, what I'm about to show you are mathematical graphs that someone wrote just with an analytic description.

815
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,700
And they were just prompted to create something artistic from that.

816
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:43,700
OK, so one of my favorites, and I think this one was from someone named Carrie, is two giraffes that just from an artistic standpoint, it's actually quite lovely.

817
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:50,700
And then to think through like actually mathematically describing everything involved here, it's such a beautiful blend of, well, like the creative side of things,

818
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,700
the artistic side with aesthetics and everything, and the analytic side.

819
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:02,700
Another that was just genuinely insane. This is by Katsini, is a bezier knight.

820
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:11,700
So I definitely wanted to highlight this on behalf of the team over at Desmos, where each one of the curves here is described according to something that's called a bezier curve.

821
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,700
Very useful for computer graphics. It's a kind of cubic parametric term.

822
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:22,700
And they just recreated a starry night in a way that's completely beautiful, I think.

823
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:30,700
And then the very last one, which is genuinely shocking that you can do with mathematical graphs in any way, was a self-portrait by Jared.

824
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:39,700
That's just like genuinely insane. I mean, I remember playing around with like a TI-84 and trying to come up with little pictures of like a smiley face and things like that.

825
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:48,700
So the amount that things have changed in terms of when someone's noodling off with their graphing calculator in class and what they can do, truly next level.

826
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:59,700
And then at the very end, I just want to say again, like a highlighted thank you to Ben Eater and to Cam, who've been extremely helpful with the whole series in ways that's like hard to even articulate properly.

827
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Eater in particular, I mean, he's let me borrow a lot of his equipment and helped out with like figuring out live footage type stuff, because that's not something I usually do, which is not even to mention the work on the live stats and live quizzes.

828
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:23,700
So if you aren't already familiar with his channel, it's simply named Ben Eater, like 100% check it out, definitely subscribe to it. Try some of the projects. He has a very project oriented way of teaching.

829
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:30,700
I think it's absolutely great. So cannot emphasize enough how grateful I am in the direction of both of those two.

830
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:41,700
And check out the item pool site where we are going to let you kind of relive the lockdown math experience and have like homework and actual challenges associated with each one of them.

831
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:47,700
So stay tuned on that. And if you're interested in being a beta user of it, there will be forums for how you can how you can reach out to both of them.

832
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:52,700
Thank you everyone for joining in the whole series. This has been very fun for me, very different for me.

833
01:06:52,700 --> 01:07:05,700
And I will shortly get back to the more usual videos, which I'm very excited about. There's a couple of topics that I just think you're thoroughly going to enjoy, especially if you like problem solving stuff like this, like really getting into good meaty problem solving.

834
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,700
That's some of what's on the horizon.

835
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:13,700
And with that, I will simply say keep loving math and enjoy the rest of your day.

836
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:49,700
Thank you.

837
01:07:52,700 --> 01:08:20,700
Thank you.
