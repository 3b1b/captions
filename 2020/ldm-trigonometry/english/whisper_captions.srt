1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,220
My end goal for this lecture and the following lecture is to draw for you a connection between trigonometry and complex numbers.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,240
And I really do think when you understand that connection between the two, it strengthens your understanding of both of them.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,500
So for this lecture, we're just going to go back to the basics on some of the trigonometric functions,

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,300
how to think about them, what they mean.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,640
And to dive into it, what I want to first do is imagine that you don't actually know any trigonometry yet,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,220
but show how just playing around with a graphing calculator can lead you to come to some pretty non-trivial facts about trig.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,520
So for example, let's say you've never heard of the cosine function.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,020
But then one day, you know, it comes up, you hear someone talking about physics,

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,340
and they mention a sinusoidal wave and the cosine function and things like that.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,200
So you go to a graphing calculator, something like Desmos, and you just poke it in and say, okay,

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,800
what does this thing look like? Now before seeing its definition, you can understand,

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,160
oh, yeah, I can see how this might be relevant to waves and wave type dynamics that people might want to study.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,700
It's got kind of a cycling phenomenon to it,

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,740
so maybe anytime people are studying something associated with cycling,

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,860
you could play around with the graph and do all the things that you can with any normal function.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,080
If I tweak the input, it kind of squishes it, right?

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,360
So as I put a bigger constant in front of that input X, it squishes things, gives it a higher frequency.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,920
Okay, that's all well and good. You could stretch it out in the Y direction by messing with the output.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,540
Now what I want to do though is point out something very interesting about the cosine graph that

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,480
is something you might want to take note of.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,340
So what I'm going to do is square it, and I don't want to show you what it looks like yet.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,760
I want you to predict what it's going to look like when we take cosine of X squared, okay?

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,320
And in particular, I'm just going to have you focus in on the region from 0 up to 2 pi.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,620
So again, if you're just playing around, what you would notice is cosine is clearly related to pi and

25
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,440
probably circles in some way. So it takes a dip down to pi,

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,020
down to negative 1 at pi, excuse me, and then it comes right back up to 1 at the input 2 pi.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,980
So what I want you to do is predict what it looks like when we take cosine of X squared.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,820
And let's actually do this as one of our fun live question dynamics, okay?

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,440
So getting rid of our Randy, which was a very informative thing for me,

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,840
let's dump into our very first genuinely mathematical quiz question.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,700
What does it say here?

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,920
What will the graph of f of X equals cosine of X squared look like?

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,820
Okay, and it looks like A as an option has these sort of valleys where in all of these

34
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,120
it might be a little small to read, but the range is going from 0 to about 2 pi.

35
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:41,080
So in A it hits 1 and then it goes down and hits 1 again at the input pi and kind of goes down with these flat valleys.

36
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,980
B has a similar behavior for when it hits 1 and 0, but it's a little spikier.

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,340
So it's kind of bouncing right off that x-axis.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,500
C looks just like a sinusoidal wave.

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,800
Okay, it looks like the same kind of wave, but it's all positive and it's, it goes from 1 down to 0,

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,740
then up to 1 in the span of pi.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,780
And then D kind of gets scrunched together in the x-direction and starts going more rapidly as you move farther to the right.

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Okay, so it looks like we've got a lot of answers coming in.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,060
A fair bit of consensus towards the top, but it's not, definitely not a unanimous decision on this one where people are going.

44
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:28,780
So it seems like there's one most popular answer and then two that kind of tie closely for the silver and the bronze medals.

45
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,120
So I'm going to give you just a couple more seconds here if you want to change your mind

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,460
or if you want to go to 3b1b.co

47
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,140
slash live and answer this as we're going.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,520
The link is also in the description if you just want to clink it there.

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,960
Clink. Click it there.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,580
And, alright, I think that's probably enough time. Let's go ahead and grade this.

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,120
What do you think it will be?

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,680
Alright, it looks like a majority of you went with C, which is the one that looks like a sinusoidal wave.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,380
The second most common one was A, which has a similar shape, but it's kind of more flattened out on the bottom.

54
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,120
Third most common was B, and then the last most common was D.

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,480
And I think that's pretty good instincts because A, B, and C, which were the top three choices there,

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,420
if we go back and look at our actual cosine graph itself,

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,300
what you'll notice is that at the input 0 it's 1, so when you square that, 1 squared should stay 1.

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,640
Similarly, negative 1 when you square that, that should come up to 1 as well.

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,940
And then positive 1 at the end of its cycle, again that's 1.

60
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,520
So the idea that no matter what you're going to get something that

61
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,240
dips down to 0, then up to 1, down to 0, and up to 1 should make sense.

62
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,260
But the specific shape is what we don't know.

63
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,140
Turns out, as you just saw, the answer is C. So if we go over here and reveal,

64
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,560
it looks just like a little cosine wave.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,670
Which is weird, if you think about it, because what we're doing when we square something is

66
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,960
affecting the output, it's affecting stuff happening in the y-direction, right?

67
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,180
But to get another cosine wave that's oscillating more quickly,

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,060
it's not at all clear that that's what would happen.

69
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,520
And using this, even before you know what the cosine of x means, if you're just playing around being kind of

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,560
childlike with your graphing calculator, you can discover a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometric functions.

71
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,440
And then as we start defining them and getting into them,

72
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,280
you will appreciate just how non-trivial it is, because it really is not obvious.

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,780
So for this, I want to take us to a second question.

74
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,780
Okay, and I look at this graph hard, okay,

75
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,380
and remember that it looks like a scaled-down version of the cosine graph.

76
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,180
And what I'm going to want you to do is

77
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,780
basically come up with an identity based on that, okay?

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
So question number two,

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,420
what does it say?

80
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:50,680
Working from the assumption that the graph of cosine of x squared looks like a scaled-down version of the graph of cosine of x,

81
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,140
which of the following equations is true?

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,160
Okay, now because this might take a little moment for you guys to work out, pencil and paper,

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,500
highly encourage you to actively work it out.

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,220
I'm just going to give you maybe 30 to 60 seconds to start penciling through, noodling it out,

85
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,100
and let's introduce a little bit of pause and ponder music just to put us in the problem-solving mood, I think.

86
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,200
So which one of these

87
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,700
reflects the fact the cosine of x squared is kind of a scaled version of itself?

88
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,300
So it looks like we still have a fair bit of answers rolling in, and I don't want you to feel rushed,

89
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,120
so I'm going to give you time to figure it out for yourself if you want to.

90
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,060
While you're answering this, it looks like we've got ourselves a question that's rolled in, okay?

91
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,060
So Diego Mathemagician, love the name, asks, what is the new music?

92
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,460
Great question. So the guy who usually composes the music for the channel, his name is Vince, Vince Rubenetti.

93
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,060
I told him that we were doing these streams, and I mentioned I wanted kind of a jeopardy.

94
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,040
Here, I'll turn it down so that I can talk over it. Vince, your music is great,

95
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
but I want to talk about it a little bit more.

96
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,660
I wanted just a jeopardy type theme, but mixed with the usual three blue and brown vibe,

97
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,060
so a little clock ticking, and I think it really puts you in the problem-solving mood.

98
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,760
Now that is probably enough to noodle this one out, so I'm going to go ahead and grade this.

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,200
And I'm guessing the majority have gotten it correct. Okay, great job.

100
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,360
So to the 3,165 of you that answered B, which is that it's one half cosine of 2x plus 1,

101
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,380
congratulations, you're absolutely correct.

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,920
But let's think about how you might do that in a step-by-step way,

103
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,940
and this is one of those things that, again, if you're just noodling around on a graphing calculator, you can come to.

104
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,760
So what I might do is take, here, I'll just go ahead and write a new cosine function, okay?

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,300
And then I'm going to start manipulating it.

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,760
So cosine of x, we won't look at the original.

107
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,740
The first thing you'd notice is, okay, we want to make it entirely positive because that's what the other one is,

108
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,020
so maybe I'm going to shift it up by one, okay? And that makes it all positive.

109
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,620
But now it's twice as high as the other graph we're looking at, so if we want to make it equal,

110
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,020
we might chop it in half.

111
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,620
But it still cycles once every 2 pi, right?

112
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,700
You have to go from 0 all the way up to 2 pi before this blue graph that we're looking at

113
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,840
goes through the cycle from 1 down to 0 now, back up to 1.

114
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,520
So the last step is going to be to squish it in the x direction.

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,660
And sometimes people find this very

116
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,860
counterintuitive that you scale up that input, that you multiply it by 2 in order to squish it.

117
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,100
But what's really going on, if you think it through, is we want to say instead of taking

118
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,760
2 pi to go through your full cycle, I want you to go through that cycle as x ranges from 0 to pi.

119
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,900
So if we make that input 2x,

120
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,180
then the thing being plugged into cosine will go from 0 to 2 pi as x goes from 0 up to pi.

121
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,800
And what you'll look at is the graphs are right on top of each other, right?

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Which is very cool, right on top of each other, and that means you've discovered a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometry.

123
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,100
And it's worth writing down because it's one of those things that comes up later in a very hard to memorize way.

124
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,320
I always had a little bit of trouble actually remembering what this thing is.

125
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:52,740
So, writing down what you just found, cosine of x squared,

126
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:59,380
okay, is equal to 1 plus cosine of 2x,

127
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,420
which is basically saying increase its frequency.

128
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,040
So we're going to double its frequency and then add 1 to it.

129
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,500
So it's going to shift above that y-axis, and then we're going to divide that by 2, okay?

130
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,020
So this is a fact that we're going to turn back to at the very end of the lecture,

131
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,100
and as you start to get an appreciation for what the cosine means,

132
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,580
it becomes clearer and clearer just how non-obvious this is.

133
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,560
And in particular, the one thing I want you to take note of is the weird fact that we've got this function that when you square it,

134
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,500
it's not equal to, but it's somewhat related to the idea of scaling up that input.

135
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,020
Now if you were clever, there is another function that behaves very similarly to this,

136
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,180
where when you square it, it's the same as doing something to its input.

137
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,520
And this actually takes us to our next question.

138
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
So let's go ahead and move past from this one,

139
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,920
okay, and I'm going to ask you something that seems very unrelated to trigonometry,

140
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,740
and it'll take us until the next lecture to realize just how related it is.

141
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,120
What does our question say?

142
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,000
Which of the following functions satisfies f of 2x is equal to f of x squared?

143
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,860
So when you plug in 2x, it should be the same as f of x squared.

144
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:22,320
Option A, square root of 1 minus x squared, option B, log of x, option C, x squared, and option D, 2 to the x.

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,040
Okay, so I'm going to give you a couple minutes, a little bit to answer that.

146
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,040
We won't take too long on this one.

147
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Oh, it looks like I accidentally graded it right away.

148
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,500
Sorry for everyone who felt a little bit rushed there, my finger slipped.

149
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,700
Well, in either case, it's now been revealed that the answer is D, 2 to the x.

150
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,800
Okay, and we can see this again if we go and just play around a little bit in our Desmos graphs.

151
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,400
So what we might do is pop over here and let me plug in 2 to the x.

152
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,160
Look at what that graph looks like.

153
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,340
So let's not look at our cosines anymore, 2 to the x.

154
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,720
And indeed, if I take this whole thing and I square it.

155
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,960
On the one hand, squaring usually does a kind of stretching motion in the y direction.

156
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,540
But what's neat about this shape is that it's exactly the same as taking 2 to the 2x.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,680
And if you know anything about exponents, this kind of makes sense because that 2 up here can get distributed into that x.

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,040
But what this means is that exponents have this funny property that when you square them, it's a lot like scaling the input.

159
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,720
And of course, the reason I bring that up is that you're looking at something very similar when it comes to cosine.

160
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,220
Just before, just by playing around with graphs, before you even know what they mean,

161
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:47,820
you can have this tiny little instinct in your head that says, maybe, just maybe, cosine is somehow related to exponents.

162
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,440
It's not at all obvious how it is, but it absolutely is.

163
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
And that's one of the things that I'd like to get to by the end of the second lecture.

164
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
We won't get to the end of there today.

165
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,540
So with all of that, I think it's high time that we actually talk about what sine and cosine actually are.

166
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,460
I don't want to come in assuming that you necessarily know that already, so let's have a little moment to go back to the basics.

167
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:18,420
I think one of the best summaries of trigonometry that I ever heard, and this was on Reddit, but I cannot for the life of me find it,

168
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,080
or remember who originally said this, is you think that it's about triangles, but really it's about circles.

169
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,780
And this is absolutely true. I think between the time when I very first learned about trigonometry and now,

170
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,940
I think my mind shifted from fundamentally thinking of a triangular-based definition, which we'll talk about in a moment, to circles.

171
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,380
And let me just show you what I mean with respect to the circles, because that's the one that explains how it comes up in physics,

172
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,360
and often how to get intuitions about where the values will be.

173
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,900
So instead of our Desmos graph, I'm going to go ahead and pull up a couple animations here.

174
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:04,440
So in this one, I'll explain what sine of theta is, where theta is the input, and it's going to be a measure of how far you've walked around a circle.

175
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,340
So I want you to imagine that you've started on the rightmost side of a circle that has a radius of one, okay?

176
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:18,100
And then as you walk around at a constant rate, as a function of how far you've walked, we're going to graph your height,

177
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,080
which is to say your y-axis on this grid. Maybe you'd think of it as the distance between you and the x-axis.

178
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,580
And as you do that, you get this wave that oscillates. And it kind of makes sense how it's just going to oscillate on and on, no matter how far you walk.

179
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:41,680
Which is why, when we go back over to the Desmos graph, and you think of something like cosine of x, not the squared version, let's just do the plain vanilla cosine x,

180
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,100
you know, it goes on forever continuing to cycle like this.

181
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,560
And I guess here I'm explaining sine of x, but it works the same way. If instead I type sine of x, we get a similar looking shape.

182
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
The only difference is that it starts at zero.

183
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:08,040
And we can take a look to explain why here, because if by definition, if it's giving your y-coordinate when you start off to the right, it starts at zero before slowly increasing.

184
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,680
Okay? Now by contrast, cosine, it's defined very similarly, but it's giving you the x-coordinate as you walk around that circle.

185
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:28,080
So the distance to the vertical line. And in that context, it starts off at one, and then as you walk around the circle, your distance from that y-axis, your x-coordinate, is going to get lower.

186
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,140
It ultimately gets down to negative one before it starts increasing again.

187
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,060
Okay?

188
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,800
So this is how you might think of sine and cosine with respect to circles.

189
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,740
The input is a kind of distance around a unit circle, but you can think of that as an angle.

190
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,040
And we're going to talk in a moment about the difference between degrees and radians.

191
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,620
But when you're thinking about walking around the circle, if it has a radius of one, you can think of that input as being the literal distance that you walk.

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,900
So as an example, notice what happens when we get to the distance pi.

193
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:01,900
Okay?

194
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,360
pi gives you the semi-circumference of one of these circles.

195
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:16,000
If it's got a radius of one, then the distance that it takes to get halfway around is pi, which is why at that input pi, you see the output go to negative one.

196
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:24,660
At half of that, if you turn to 90 degree angle, which means walking around a distance of pi halves, that's why cosine is zero at that point.

197
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,700
So now I'm going to ask you another question where we're going to consider the input in terms of this idea of a distance around the unit circle.

198
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,760
And I'm just going to have you guess at some of the values for sine and cosine.

199
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
So we'll go ahead and pull up our quiz again.

200
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,770
And this time, let's get it up on here.

201
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,680
What does our question say?

202
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,160
Without looking it up or using a calculator, which of the following is true?

203
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:03,240
And it's reminding us that that input 3 is going to be considered in radians, which is to say the distance around the unit circle, if you're just walking along at the arc length.

204
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:11,100
Option A, the sine of 3 is around 0.14 and the cosine of 3 is around 0.99.

205
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,820
B, the sine of 3 is around 0.14 and the cosine of 3 is around negative 0.99.

206
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,580
C, sine of 3 is around 0.99, cosine of 3 is around 0.14.

207
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,200
And D, sine of 3 is around negative 0.99 and cosine of 3 is around 0.14.

208
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,700
Okay, so just to give you a little moment to think that through.

209
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,800
It seems like there's not a 100% consensus on this question and answers are still rolling in.

210
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,700
So I'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit of pause and ponder music.

211
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,040
I'll let you just think about it. I don't want you to feel rushed here.

212
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,320
Okay, so I think this is probably a pretty good time to start grading things.

213
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,580
So the correct answer is B.

214
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:37,440
And it looks like the majority of you got the correct answer, which is to say that sine is 0.14 and cosine is negative 0.99.

215
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:46,040
Now the specific numbers here don't matter. What's actually relevant is just kind of whether it's positive or negative and whether it's very close to 1 or if it's closer to 0.

216
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:56,600
So if we think through what this might mean in the context of our graphs here, the cosine, which remember is measuring the x-coordinate of your little dot as you walk around the circle.

217
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,320
What is that going to be when you input 3? Well, what does it mean to walk 3 units around the circle?

218
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,560
Well, like I just mentioned, walking pi units around the circle gets you halfway around.

219
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,060
This is really the way to think about pi is you've got a unit circle, it takes you halfway around.

220
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,660
So to walk 3 units is going to be something a little bit shy of that.

221
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,760
Okay, and if you notice, there's very little change in the x direction as you're at that left side of the circle.

222
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,900
So when it approaches 1, it gets really close to 1 and then it doesn't really change that much.

223
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:43,040
So maybe it shouldn't be too surprising that our cosine of 3 turned out to be around 0.99.

224
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,140
Which, same game, but it's measuring your y-coordinate.

225
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:55,260
When you walk almost halfway around, which is to say almost pi radians, well, there's still a little bit of height left.

226
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,300
And importantly, it's positive because you're still above that x-axis.

227
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:08,320
So when we turn back to our question, the only thing differentiating our answers was that some of them would switch whether sine or cosine was the one that's close to negative 1.

228
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,400
And the others would just switch the sine, s-i-g-n, whether it's positive or negative.

229
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,700
So congratulations to the 3,152 of you who got that one correct.

230
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,880
So that's loosely how you might think about sine and cosine if we're coming at it from the direction of circles.

231
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:32,260
But this is very different from how it's usually taught if we're doing things like in a typical high school class where you start off thinking about right triangles.

232
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,300
One is not better, they're just very different and worth understanding the connection.

233
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:49,800
So the classic thing when it comes to trig functions is a little statement that everyone has ringing through their head called SOH CAH TOA.

234
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,380
And what you're supposed to remember from this is if we have a right triangle, so let me go ahead and draw a right triangle.

235
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:10,840
So we know one of the angles is 90 degrees. And if you know another one of the angles, theta, then consider one of the sides to be the hypotenuse.

236
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:19,880
And then you ask what of the other two legs is adjacent to that angle, and we label it a for adjacent, and which of them is opposite.

237
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:32,220
So then SOH CAH TOA, if that's a phrase that you remember running through your head, tells you that the sine of this angle, this is the definition of sine for some kind of angle that we input,

238
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:39,280
is for such a right triangle, it's the opposite over the hypotenuse. That's what this is telling us, opposite over hypotenuse.

239
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:50,800
Similarly, the cosine of that angle is going to equal the adjacent over the hypotenuse. So that would be adjacent over hypotenuse.

240
00:21:51,780 --> 00:22:03,960
And then the tangent of that angle is going to be the opposite over the adjacent. So that opposite side O over the adjacent side.

241
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,080
So that is the classic thing to remember if students come out of a trig class, if they know one thing, they typically know SOH CAH TOA.

242
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:22,700
And to give us an example of how you might apply this, I'm going to go ahead and pull up another question here for you, which is going to ask us about a leaning tower, a leaning tower of Pisa.

243
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,240
Clearing out the last one, let's read what our new question has to say.

244
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:41,480
Suppose that a tower is 100 meters high. After several years, the tower starts to lean. So instead of making a 90 degree angle with the ground, it makes an 80 degree angle.

245
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,980
When the sun is directly overhead, what is the length of the shadow cast by this leaning tower?

246
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,800
Okay, the length of the shadow cast by this leaning tower. I would highly encourage you to try drawing this out yourself.

247
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:03,480
I'm absolutely going to draw it for you in a moment, but it's more fun if you're engaged and if you have a pencil and paper to noodle it out.

248
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:11,640
You could also try to imagine it in your head if you want. But for me, at least, I always think much more clearly once I have pencil and paper, no matter how much I think I can think things through in my head.

249
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,720
So let's give you a little pause and ponder time on this one.

250
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,240
Looks like we have some very strong consensus on this one, which is very reassuring.

251
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:59,840
And I guess one thing that should maybe go without saying, especially given that I've turned the super chat or the live chat into the very aggressive slow mode.

252
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,880
This is most fun if you don't know what the majority of people are already thinking. The whole idea of the statistics is right now you can see there's a bandwagon.

253
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,580
There's 2600 people who are voting for one of the answers who think that's it, but we don't know what one of those answers is.

254
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:28,080
So if you have the answer, try not to just blurted out in the live chat. That's kind of the equivalent of a student in a classroom where when the teacher asks something, rather than raising their hand to ask it or submitting it quietly, just shouting.

255
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,220
I get it. You're excited. You really want to do it. But in this case, it's a little bit more fun if we have the slow reveal.

256
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:43,520
So that's probably enough time for people to have rolled their answers in. Let's go ahead and see what the majority has submitted.

257
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:56,620
And the correct answer is B, which is 100 times the cosine of 80. And it looks like the second most common answer was A, which is 100 times the sine of 80.

258
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:05,540
So it looks like you guys correctly knew that you were multiplying it by one of these trigonometric functions, but there might have just been a little swap up for which one was which.

259
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,280
So let's think this through. Okay, let's go back to our paper. And our question had us imagine a tower which is 100 meters tall.

260
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:26,240
And specifically, it said it was 100 meters tall and then it started tilting. So we can think of the length of the towers 100 meters. That's not necessarily how far its new top is off of the ground.

261
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:34,640
And then it has us imagine that there's the sun directly overhead. Okay, so it's going to be casting a shadow perpendicular to the ground.

262
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,460
That's what gives us our nice right triangle. And it further specified that the angle here was 80 degrees.

263
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:49,900
Okay, so the thing we want to know is this side here, the length of the shadow, which if we look at our SOHCAHTOA, that's the adjacent side.

264
00:25:49,960 --> 00:26:00,520
So we might write for ourselves cosine of this angle, which is 80 degrees, is equal to that adjacent side, the thing that we want to know.

265
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:08,740
I'll just call it x, or maybe I'll call it s for shadow, try to give our variables readable meanings, divided by the hypotenuse, which is 100.

266
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:18,260
So that means that the shadow, once we rearrange, is 100 times the cosine of 80 degrees.

267
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:27,480
Now already this feels very different from the thought of trigonometry via circles. Like I said, you start to think about it in terms of triangles, later it comes to circles.

268
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:37,140
One of the main differences here is that we're dealing with a different unit, right? Here I was saying degrees, and that's very natural when we're in the context of triangles.

269
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:47,780
We could also talk about angles in terms of radians, like I'll say in a moment, but when humans assign numbers and numerical systems to things, we really like whole numbers between 0 and 100.

270
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:55,440
We just love that. Instead of thinking of proportions, we think in terms of percentages, which is the same thing, but it just turns it to whole numbers between 0 and 100.

271
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:07,040
When we think about like sound with decibels, which scales a whole bunch and it's got this crazy exponential pattern to it, we logarithmically change it and we have this very awkward system that's really twisting the math behind its back,

272
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:17,180
so that we can think of whole numbers between 0 and 100. Same deal with what's going on with degrees, but mathematicians don't really like that. They don't really like to think in terms of degrees, because it's so unnatural.

273
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,100
Instead, they want some sort of natural unit, something where you imagine if you talk to an alien civilization about math, they would have the same conventions.

274
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:32,400
So how does any of this connect to the unit circle and the idea of the distance around that unit circle that we were walking, like we saw earlier?

275
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,360
Well, let me just pull up a pre-printed unit circle, because trust me, you don't want to see me try to draw a circle.

276
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:50,620
What's neat here is we can, for each of these triangles, imagine rescaling it so that that hypotenuse is really 1, because all we care about are ratios of lengths of sides.

277
00:27:50,620 --> 00:28:04,640
So we might as well say, okay, let's scale this so that the hypotenuse is 1, meaning we divide everything by h, and what that's going to get us is the opposite side is now O over h, whatever that was,

278
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:16,540
and then the adjacent side is A over h, meaning that the vertical component here is sine of theta, where theta was our angle down here,

279
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,400
and then that bottom part is cosine of theta.

280
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:37,980
And if we want to think about all possible right triangles who have a hypotenuse of 1, what you might think of is taking a unit circle, because that's saying every point is a distance of 1 away, so think of that line as the hypotenuse of a triangle.

281
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,620
If you have a triangle with a bigger angle, it shows up there. If you have a triangle with a smaller angle, it shows up there.

282
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:55,460
And it's as if you take all possible right triangles and you fix them so that their points are all in common, and such that their hypotenuses are all 1, you scale them down,

283
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:13,040
and the other tip of the triangle is going to trace out a unit circle like this, and each one of these points for the corresponding angle is going to have coordinates, cosine of theta as the x-coordinate, and then sine of theta for the y-coordinate.

284
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,680
And I'm just writing it vertically so I can fit it all on here.

285
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:32,100
Now typically, like I said, mathematicians like to think in terms of radians, which is really a way of saying if we know that the radius of our circle is 1, what is the distance that you've walked along the outside here?

286
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:44,700
So for example, if you were to say 180 degrees, which is walking halfway around the circle, that's the same as pi radians.

287
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:55,440
And if you were to take something like 60 degrees, which would maybe end up, I don't know, around here, that might be 60 degrees.

288
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Well, that's a third of that. You're walking a third of the half turn around the circle.

289
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:08,640
Everyone who's an enthusiast about tau is sort of yelling right now because it would make the conventions easier, but pi is the standard, so we're working with it.

290
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,400
It's pi, thirds, radians.

291
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:26,580
Okay? So from this point forward, and really for a lot of your math career, I would encourage you to, every time you want to think in terms of degrees, where that makes the angle intuitive, try to translate it to radians, because that's going to be the more natural way to understand it.

292
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:38,300
And the farther you get down the road when it comes to how sine and cosine play into calculus, how you actually find values of them, almost all of the time it's easier to think of that input in terms of radians.

293
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:48,940
So I think it's high time I ask you a couple questions about these, and you might wonder, you know, how do we actually compute some of the values, right? How to compute.

294
00:30:52,140 --> 00:31:01,760
And the honest answer is that it's hard. If there was an easy answer to say, oh, well, this is the formula that shows you what sine of theta is, we wouldn't have given sine of theta a fancy name.

295
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,360
We would just always work in terms of that formula, and we would call it the circle y coordinate formula, and it might get a name, but it wouldn't be a special function.

296
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:28,440
It wouldn't have a special button on your calculator, because effectively what you have to do is, before you know fancy techniques associated with calculus, or associated with even fancier things like what's known as the Kordak algorithm, you just have to have a handful of values that you do know that come from geometric settings where there's enough symmetry.

297
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:46,500
So for example, let's say I try to draw an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle will be nice and symmetric, and we're going to be able to leverage that symmetry to figure out a concrete value of sine and cosine.

298
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,700
This looks roughly equilateral, wouldn't you say?

299
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:05,680
And let's say each of those side lengths is one, because if we get to choose our side lengths, why not one? Because remember, sine and cosine have everything to do with just ratios.

300
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,880
So on an equilateral triangle, this angle here is a third of the total. The total is 180 degrees, so you might think of this as 60 degrees.

301
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:25,640
But like I said earlier, I would encourage you to try to get in the habit of thinking of that instead of 60 degrees, say, okay, the full angle is pi, so a third of that is going to be pi thirds.

302
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,340
And then similarly, this one up here is half that angle. Here's where we're leveraging that symmetry to some extent.

303
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:42,740
That one is 30 degrees, which in terms of radians is now a sixth of a half turn. All the tau enthusiasts get very mad at this point.

304
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:53,200
But again, hey, it's the convention. This is the thing that you should come out of a trig class knowing in your head how to think in terms of radians measured in pi, because that's how we often write it down in tests and such.

305
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,220
So that one will be pi sixths.

306
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:06,600
So one thing I might ask you now is if you can leverage the symmetry of the setup, the fact that equilateral triangles are going to be very nice and that the right triangle coming about from it is very nice,

307
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,900
to answer something like a very concrete calculation, what is the sine of pi sixths?

308
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,660
OK, what do you think it is? And in fact, let's do this as another live question, which, as you can see, I'm like a kid in a candy shop.

309
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:27,100
I'm just very enthusiastic with my new toy. So let's go ahead and use it. Pull up another question here.

310
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,480
And what does our question ask?

311
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,940
What is the sine of pi sixths, of course? So again, if you want, if you're just joining now, you can hop over to 3b1b.co. Live.

312
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:49,660
You can answer that. I imagine the best way to do this if you're doing it live is you might be answering on your phone, watching on another screen, or if you want to switch between tabs.

313
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:57,380
That's also good. Now, while those answers are rolling in, let's take a look to see if we have anything from the audience.

314
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:03,080
And we do. When you do maths problems, do you use pen or pencil? For sure I use pencil.

315
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,760
One, I'm very error prone, so I'm going to make mistakes all the time.

316
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:16,920
The only reason I'm writing in pen now is because it shows up better on the camera. And let me just tell you, with every stroke that I write, I'm deeply terrified that there's about to be an error, because I know there will be.

317
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,920
So if that terror doesn't show in the shaking of my hands, then you'll start to notice it from this point forward.

318
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:36,100
Back to our question, though. It looks like we've got pretty strong consensus now, around 2,091 people agreeing on one of the answers, and then a pretty even split among the other ones.

319
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,540
Oh, no, no, I guess the length of the bar is a little, whoever worked on the scaling, maybe a little bit misleading.

320
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:53,900
It looks like one of the answers is much less popular than the other two. But I guess it's considering them to start from somewhere like that. Maybe we should have some axes on there indicating that.

321
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,700
So there's one very unpopular answer, and then one very popular answer. So let's go ahead and see what that turns out to be.

322
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:14,180
Correct answer is one half. Congratulations to the 2800, no, no, 2915 of you coming into the last minute there to pull in a correct answer.

323
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:22,700
Okay, so why is that the case? Why is that necessarily going to be one half? Well, remember, sine of pi six, we're asking SOHCAHTOA.

324
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,280
So kind of remembering your head, sine is opposite over adjacent, opposite over hypotenuse, excuse me.

325
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:41,460
So with respect to this smaller angle, maybe I'll change colors. With respect to this smaller angle, the opposite side is this segment here.

326
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,180
And because of the symmetry of our triangle, that's going to be one half. Because each side length of the equilateral triangle is one, so half of it should be one half.

327
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,600
And divided by the hypotenuse, but by definition the hypotenuse was one here. So one half divided by one, it's just the same as one half.

328
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:08,280
Now, slightly trickier is if I'd asked you the cosine of pi six. And let's do this one again as a live quiz, but maybe a little bit more quickly this time.

329
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm going to hop over, get to our next question, and as you might expect, the next question is going to ask you to find the cosine of pi divided by six.

330
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:30,640
There we go. And your options are A, one half, B, square root of two divided by two, C, square root of three divided by two, or D, square root of five divided by two.

331
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:40,480
If you can, I would highly encourage you to be keeping your own notes, right? So if you wanted to kind of check back on your own piece of paper, you could take a look through it as you're working out these questions.

332
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,200
But for right now, I'm just going to give you maybe 20 seconds or so to kind of noodle through it, think of what it might be. Get a little pause and ponder music going.

333
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,920
Okay.

334
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,920
Once again, it looks like we have some pretty strong consensus from about the same number of people that we had before. So let's go ahead and grade the answers.

335
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:33,860
And the correct one is C, square root of three divided by two. So congratulations to the 3183 of you who knew that it was square root of three divided by two.

336
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:43,840
Now, how do you figure something like that out? Well, the trick is basically if you have one of these right triangles, if you know one of their sides, then you know both of them.

337
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:57,240
So let me draw a little copy for ourselves here. We know that the hypotenuse is one, one of the side lengths is one half, and the only thing that's missing if we're thinking the cosine of 30 degrees is this adjacent side.

338
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:11,580
So because we were doing it with the angle up there, adjacent side is here. Now the Pythagorean theorem tells us that that adjacent value squared plus the other leg length squared is going to equal one squared.

339
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:23,000
A hypotenuse squared, which means that value is equal to the square root of one minus, well what's one half squared? It's one fourth.

340
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,740
Which means it is the square root of one minus a fourth is three fourths.

341
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:37,760
So we can go ahead and take the square root of that bottom and just leave the radical in the top. And what we get is the square root of three all divided by two.

342
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,360
Now this is a value that anybody coming out of a trig class becomes very familiar with. They're like, okay, if the answer isn't one half, it's going to be square root of three over two.

343
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:54,400
Or root two over two also comes up in another circumstance. But this is one of those that kind of becomes burned in your memory. Square root of three divided by two.

344
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:06,980
And one very important fact that's come about here that's worth highlighting is that, hmm, how does the Pythagorean theorem play into our trigonometry?

345
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:16,100
Because if we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is one, and we know that one of the side lengths, let me switch to thinking with respect to this lower left angle again.

346
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:36,900
If one of the side lengths is cosine of theta, and one of them is sine of theta, well the Pythagorean theorem tells us that cosine of x squared plus sine of x squared is always equal to one squared.

347
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:45,080
Okay? Now this is a very important identity. It basically tells you if you know cosine, you know sine. If you know sine, you know cosine.

348
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,080
And it also is giving you a little reminder that it's all really about the Pythagorean theorem. In fact, this is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem.

349
00:39:52,320 --> 00:40:00,100
Because if you think of how cosine and sine are defined, it's just defined in terms of the leg lengths of a right triangle, and then everything scaled down as needed.

350
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:10,460
Now there's one very silly convention with how we write these things. So we've already started to make friends with the cosine of x squared function, and the fact that it's a little more interesting than you might think at first sight.

351
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:27,280
But you never see it written down as open parenthesis cosine of x closed parenthesis squared. Because people don't want to write too many parenthesis, instead they write cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x.

352
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,180
It's all very nice. How lovely. We don't have to write too many symbols. What a wonderful convention.

353
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:47,300
Except for the fact that literally every other time in math you see something written as f squared of x, what that means is not f of x squared. That's almost never what it means.

354
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:59,100
Instead, what it's supposed to mean for most of math is taking a function and applying it to itself, like layering it over itself. That's what that 2 usually refers to.

355
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:08,640
Sometimes later on it refers to the second derivative, especially if it has some parenthesis around it. But the idea is that it's very different from the convention in trigonometry.

356
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,240
Trigonometry is just flying by its own rules and saying, yeah, yeah, we've got our own conventions for what it means when you put a little 2 up there.

357
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:24,040
I understand some students will be confused, but I'm trigonometry. I don't care. I'm moving forward with my conventions. And that's fine. You get used to it.

358
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:36,680
This is the standard way that you'll end up seeing it. What I was writing earlier when we were thinking about the cosine squared function, which again is very interesting, you would almost always see it written as cos squared of x.

359
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:46,200
Now, very interesting is that this is not just a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem that gives us a relation between our trig functions.

360
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,760
At the end of the lecture, I want to show you how you can use trig functions to prove the Pythagorean theorem in a sneaky way.

361
00:41:53,180 --> 00:42:00,280
And it's pretty sneaky. Like it's not one of the common proofs that you'll see that's associated with, you know, rearranging triangles or anything like that.

362
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,040
But it is very visually satisfying. So that's something that we'll get to by the end of the lecture.

363
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,900
But in the meantime, I want to think through a couple more of our of our trig function questions.

364
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,180
OK, so we kind of come back up here. We just found cosine of pi six, which is square root of three over two.

365
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:28,740
But let's answer it for a couple more complicated ones. So far, I'm dealing only with angles that were between zero and 90 degrees, or I should say between zero and pi halves.

366
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:40,880
But let's try a question that's a little bit different from that. And what if I instead said cosine of negative two pi over three?

367
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,900
OK, now that's one that is hard to think of in terms of triangles, because what does it mean to have a negative angle?

368
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,640
So this is a good reminder that cosine and sine, even if you think they're about triangles, are really about circles.

369
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:04,120
And remember, if you walk all the way around the circle, and if it has a radius of one, walking all the way around the circle is going to take you a distance of two pi.

370
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:14,780
So if you want to think about two pi thirds, what you might start by doing is chopping the triangle into thirds and then using that to help guide the intuitions.

371
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,200
But again, I kind of want to do this as a live quiz. So let's go ahead and pull up the next question.

372
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,600
And have you guys answer this for me. What do you think the cosine of two pi divided by three?

373
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,220
Let's go ahead and pull it up. Cosine of negative two pi divided by three.

374
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,920
So again, if you're keeping notes, that can be very helpful. You reference your notes now.

375
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:47,720
But just to make sure that you have enough time to think this through, I'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit more of that pause and ponder music.

376
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:07,500
It looks like one of you figured out how to submit an answer that is not one of the four multiple choices.

377
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:15,860
So other than that, we've got a very strong lead with 1152 of you, as I say this, agreeing on one of the answers.

378
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,480
And then second place by about a factor of four is going to sit on another one.

379
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,580
I'm curious about actually what what all the answer distribution here is. I'm very curious about.

380
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:37,240
Oh, now we have a sixth. OK, so two of you have now gone outside the realm of the typical multiple choice universe and have entered your own things.

381
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,320
Two of you sit there and say, I don't want one of your choices.

382
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,820
I figured out my own answer and you just didn't put it in your form. So I'm going to figure out a way to submit it differently.

383
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,260
If only you could do that on the SAT. What is the answer? A through E.

384
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,580
Sir, I think the answer is J. 1729.

385
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,440
We got Ramanujan's constant. Oh, if I pause it now, though, it's not going to stay there for a brief, glorious moment.

386
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:08,940
We had a wonderful number. Maybe I can pause it around the year, though, because it's 1999. 2031.

387
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,620
OK, well, I've paused it in the future. So the correct answer in this context is negative one half.

388
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,640
OK. And it looks like the second most common answer was D, which is negative root three over two.

389
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:28,900
OK, so that's very good because often it's kind of this back and forth between whether you think it's a half or whether you think it's root three over two,

390
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:36,500
because it's sort of the difference between things that feel like 30 degree angles and things that feel like 60 degree angles.

391
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,280
So let's take a look back at our drawing and see how we might think about this.

392
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,520
So, like I said, negative two pi divided by three. That's taking us a negative distance over here.

393
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,380
And this is why cosine will be a negative number, because the x coordinate is pointing in the negative direction.

394
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,680
And if you want to think of this in terms of triangles, I might draw this triangle here and ask, what is this angle?

395
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:10,960
OK, we know that it's 90 degrees plus something or pi halves plus something and negative two pi over thirds.

396
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:23,080
If we wanted to think in terms of degrees, if that's something we're more comfortable with, that's negative 360 divided by three degrees, which is negative 120 degrees.

397
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:32,460
So if it takes 120 degrees to get around here, then that minus the 90 degree angle between the x and y axis gives us 30 degrees.

398
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,820
OK, so then the question is, what is the cosine of this value? What is the x coordinate there?

399
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:48,720
With your 30, 60, 90 triangles, it's just kind of a nice thing to remember that the shorter side is one half and the longer side is root three over two.

400
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:56,220
And if you forget why, it's exactly the diagram that we just drew before associated with equilateral triangles.

401
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:05,760
Because if you imagine taking the equilateral triangle and chopping it in half, then the shorter side has length one half and then the longer side comes from the Pythagorean theorem.

402
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,340
So congratulations to those of you who correctly found that.

403
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:25,480
Now, I want to bring back that identity that you guys found at the very beginning, associated with cosine squared and cosine of two thetas, and show how that extends our capability for making some of these computations and figuring out certain values.

404
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,860
So let's remind ourselves what that actually was.

405
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm going to go back here and I'm going to pull up again the Desmos graph.

406
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:45,820
And remember how what we said is that cosine squared, which looks like this little scaled down version of cosine, oscillating more quickly, is the same as cosine of two x, that quicker oscillation.

407
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,540
But we had to kind of shift it and rescale it to make them equal.

408
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:57,180
So now we're going to use that fact that you can discover just by playing around with graphs to make a computation that otherwise would be pretty tricky to make.

409
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,840
And I think that when you're able to make concrete computations, it's often a reflection of the fact that you have a deeper conceptual understanding of what's going on.

410
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:15,040
So even if it's always going to be your calculator computing this, you're not sitting here working out cosine values by hand, the fact that you can is an illustrate that you understand that cosine function a little bit better.

411
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,200
So over on our paper, let me write down again what that identity was.

412
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,680
Let's go back to black. Good old friendly black.

413
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:33,100
Cosine squared of x, using the dumb dumb convention, is one plus cosine of two x.

414
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,480
So it's kind of oscillating more quickly, all divided by two.

415
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:48,680
OK, so now I'm going to ask you a trickier question, which is going to be what is the cosine of pi twelfths?

416
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,500
And for those of you keeping track, pi twelfths is the same as 15 degrees.

417
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,440
So if we were doing this with a unit circle, what you might think is, OK, a 30 degree angle.

418
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,700
It's looking like this.

419
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,140
That's 30 degrees. I'm now going to be taking half of that.

420
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:18,220
Half of that. And I want to know the cosine of this value, which is going to be the x coordinate of that value.

421
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:23,440
And right away, you can probably make a guess that it's very close to one, right, because it's a small angle.

422
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:31,300
And the small angle means that we haven't walked that far around a circle, so we haven't gotten that far away from one,

423
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,120
especially given the fact that as you start to walk, almost all of your velocity is in the up and down direction.

424
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,460
All right, so cosine of pi twelfths, 15 degrees. You know what's about to happen.

425
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,860
You know that this is a live quiz dynamic. So let's pull it up.

426
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,880
All right.

427
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,040
What is the cosine of pi divided by 12?

428
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,180
OK, lots of answers rolling in. Very fun, very exciting.

429
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:09,840
Again, if you just happen to be tuning in now, you haven't been following along before, go to 3b1b.co slash live.

430
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,860
Your answers will become part of what you're seeing on screen. It affects the overall distribution.

431
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,760
This one, unlike what we had before, much less overall consensus.

432
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:28,760
And it definitely seems to be taking a bit more time. So I'm going to just stop talking and give you some some pause and ponder moments here, because this one is tricky.

433
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,720
This one takes time to think through.

434
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:50,980
So.

435
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,960
Now it looks like there's a total of five of you who have extended beyond the realm of usual multiple choice.

436
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:32,240
By the way, as you guys are entering answers here, let me just say a huge thanks to Ben Eater and Cam Christensen.

437
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,720
They're the ones who actually worked on the item pool website that is making all of this possible.

438
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,340
Eater, many of you might recognize from his own YouTube channel, named Ben Eater about computer engineering.

439
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:54,080
If you haven't checked it out, you absolutely should. And then item pool is a pretty cool thing that will be unfolding over the next coming months and year.

440
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,220
So you might want to keep your eye on that.

441
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,100
It looks like some more consensus is starting to form. So I'm going to go ahead and grade this question.

442
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,760
It looks like I'm getting a phone call.

443
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,140
Awesome. So the correct answer is B, which is square root of it's a very complicated thing, right?

444
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,280
Square root of one plus the square root of three over two divided by two.

445
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:27,300
So congratulations to the two to two nine of you who two to two for two to four three.

446
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,200
Two thousand two hundred forty three of you. How are the answers still changing?

447
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,220
Going to have to talk to Cam and Eater about that. My hands are not on this. Who got that correct?

448
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,060
Now it looks like the second most common answer was A, which is of a very similar form.

449
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:45,640
There's just a minus sign in there. So it's probably the case that while doing the arithmetic, something got flipped.

450
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,440
We're going to walk through it in a moment so you can see.

451
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,280
And a special congratulations to the two of you who figured out how to submit an at sign on this.

452
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:01,740
Oh, the three of you who submitted an at sign. That's not the correct answer, but well done. Well done, four of you. Very nice.

453
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:07,260
All right. So clearly this is a complicated answer, but where does it come from?

454
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:15,500
Well, if we look at our identity here, the key is that it's relating two times an angle to the angle itself.

455
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:24,460
So if we just plug this in for 15 degrees or for pi twelfth, what we would get is that the cosine squared of pi twelfth.

456
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:36,520
OK, if we enter that as X is equal to one plus the cosine of two times that value, which is pi six.

457
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,820
Pi six. All divided by two. Now, the cosine of pi six. We know.

458
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,700
That's the same as our 30 degree angle here.

459
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:57,780
Again, when you have a 30, 60, 90 triangle, the shorter side of that, which is going to be the sign in this context, the shorter side is one half.

460
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:07,820
And then the longer side is square root of three over two, assuming that the hypotenuse is one, which in the context of the unit circle, we always do assume.

461
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:13,140
So that means that we now have one plus the square root of three over two.

462
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,520
That's what the cosine of pi six was all divided by two, which means our final answer.

463
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,600
When we just want to say cosine of pi twelfth, no squared about it is going to be the square root of this value.

464
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,000
OK, very interesting. So this is showing us that cosine and sine can get complicated.

465
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,940
We've got a handful of values like pi six and pi thirds where we can figure them out.

466
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:47,600
We can have even more, I won't call them trivial values, but easier to compute values like cosine of pi, where you would look at your unit circle and say, oh, pi.

467
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,940
That means I've walked halfway around. So my x coordinate is negative one.

468
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,700
But outside of just a handful of values like that, they're very hard to compute by hand.

469
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:05,160
And in the olden days, the only way that people could compute them by hand for something like the existence of calculus would be measuring it.

470
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:16,520
You like draw out with a protractor and you try to carefully see what the coordinates are or layering on usage of identities like this over and over in ways that you can get approximate values like this.

471
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:23,620
And just to check ourselves, we can actually go and plug this into a calculator if we wanted to, something like Desmos and just see,

472
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,560
one, how big the value is and kind of confirm for ourselves that they turn out to be the same.

473
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,520
So if we pop over here and I just type something like.

474
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:39,700
Cosine of pi over 12. Point nine six five.

475
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:47,700
OK, so like I said, very close to one, and that's kind of what we would expect. And the answer we just got was the square root of one plus the square root of three.

476
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,520
Got to make sure I do the divided by two correctly.

477
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:57,460
By two. Right. That looks correct. But then all of that was divided by two.

478
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,220
All that stuff on the inside was divided by two. And indeed, they're the same value.

479
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,580
So even just something like pi 12, we end up getting a very convoluted image.

480
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:15,880
Now, like I said, this is a reflection of the fact that our cosine identity that we found at the very beginning, just by playing through with graphs, it's definitely not obvious.

481
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:23,360
And what we'll find next time is that this is actually a shadow of the fact that trigonometric functions are related to complex numbers.

482
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,260
And the idea of doubling the angle here corresponding to multiplying by something twice, not at all a coincidence.

483
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,660
I think it's very fun. I'm excited to show you guys all about that.

484
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:39,280
Now, what I wanted to do just to finish things off here, though, was to show two things that are not commonly shown about the unit circle.

485
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,640
OK, so we see where sine and cosine are, but there might be a couple of questions.

486
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,600
Where is tan? OK, where in our picture do we see tangent of theta?

487
00:56:51,180 --> 00:57:02,400
And then also, where is cosine of x or cosine of theta squared or with the dumb convention, cosine squared of theta?

488
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,980
So pulling up another one of my infinite supply of unit circles here.

489
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:18,380
Actually, you know what? This one's not going to have enough y axis, so I'm going to do something that I really shouldn't do, which is to try to use a compass live on camera.

490
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,880
I'm sort of terrible at using compasses because it always slips out for me.

491
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,120
We're just going to do this. I'm so nervous that this is going to somehow slip out.

492
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,860
Oh, yeah, that actually didn't turn out too badly.

493
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,560
Hopefully the pencil shows up OK on screen.

494
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:42,640
The reason I'm doing this is the tangent is going to demand that we think outside of the box, that we think outside of the circle in order to geometrically interpret it.

495
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:50,880
You could just ask about the opposite divided by the adjacent, which is where that SOHCAHTOA TOA comes from.

496
00:57:51,380 --> 00:58:00,100
But what I really want is a single length in our diagram that corresponds to the tangent so we can kind of get that nice geometric intuitive feel for it.

497
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:11,960
And the idea is we take that radius, which is one, and if we think of the fact that tangent of theta, SOHCAHTOA, is supposed to be the opposite over the adjacent,

498
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,480
I want a triangle where that adjacent is equal to one.

499
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,860
OK, so a right triangle such that this one is the adjacent side to our angle theta.

500
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:29,140
Well, in order to do that, let's just draw a right angled perpendicular line off of our radial line.

501
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:37,580
And some of you might know that if you draw a perpendicular line to the radius of a circle, it actually lies tangent to the circle.

502
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,340
So you see tangent, this is where the word comes from.

503
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:49,020
Then what we have is a triangle where the adjacent side to theta is one and then the opposite side is this length here.

504
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:53,520
So that length there is the tangent of theta.

505
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:06,100
And so right now you can kind of intuitively understand that as theta is very small, when the opposite over adjacent is very close to zero, because that opposite is close to zero and the adjacent is close to one.

506
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,160
Well, indeed, this length also is getting very close to zero.

507
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,740
And then you can also think through what happens as that angle approaches 90 degrees.

508
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:23,180
This is something I actually illustrated once before in a previous video, a lesser known video entitled Tattoos on Math.

509
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,740
That, fun fact, includes someone who is behind the scenes as we say all of this right now.

510
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:36,180
But the idea is that when you draw that tangent line, tangent is this length that I just pointed out to you.

511
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:44,280
And in that context, you could also think about cotangent. There's this whole other triad of trigonometric functions that aren't worth teaching, but are kind of historical quirks.

512
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,360
That's actually what that whole video was about.

513
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:53,820
But from here, you can just play around with moving the angle theta and seeing what that does to this tangent value, to that tangent length.

514
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:02,460
And using that intuition, actually, I want you to place a guess on what the graph of tangent of theta is going to look like.

515
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:08,060
So once again, let's go over to our live question dynamic. Again, congratulations to those of you who got the last one right.

516
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:20,160
And as our final question before the end of this particular stream, which is a rather tall question, so it might actually pop up over, over below the values we have available here.

517
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:26,160
The final question, I just want you to guess what the tangent of theta looks like when we graph it.

518
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,900
And it should be pulled up now.

519
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,780
And oh, there we go. It is rather tall, though. OK.

520
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,400
So let me go ahead and pull up a separate image for you here so that you can see all of the options.

521
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,500
Let's pop over here and take a look. Great.

522
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:52,060
So again, if you go to 3b1b.co slash live, where the link is in the description, you can submit your answers to this.

523
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,500
Basically, which one of these graphs shows you the tangent of theta?

524
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,640
Unfortunately, we're going to have to kind of switch back and forth to see the statistics.

525
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:12,120
It looks like there's pretty strong consensus in one direction, but I'm going to give you I'm going to give you a little bit more time to think about it if you want to.

526
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,240
Don't feel rushed. Don't feel like you have to jump right into it.

527
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,040
I want a little ambient pause and ponder music while we're at it.

528
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,720
I'm mildly addicted to it.

529
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,280
All right.

530
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:15,440
So while you're answering. So as we can see, some people are clearly messing with the website and having fun, or there's a bug in the website to answer various other things.

531
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:24,500
Other fun thing going on. It seems like we've got a couple comments in the in the Json associated with the answers.

532
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:36,660
So to the person who decided to skip over my very draconian limits on the live chat dynamic and instead entered in Json comment through the answer forum forum.

533
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,820
I really enjoyed this class. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I appreciate your your hacky instincts. You're going to go far in life, my friend.

534
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,920
You're going to go very, very far. So let's go ahead and grade this question here.

535
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,300
It looks like we have very strong consensus, hopefully around the correct answer.

536
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:03,440
And the correct answer is a again, maybe a little bit hard to see on our on our indication of the question over here.

537
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:12,320
But a is the graph that looks like this. And what you'll notice is it starts at zero. And then as you approach pi halves, it blows up to infinity.

538
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:27,560
OK, now, in terms of the animations and the geometric interpretation of tangent, that should actually make sense, because if we go back to what we were looking at as the angle blows up, the angle doesn't blow up.

539
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:34,360
The angle does a very modest thing of simply going to pi halves a fine number. But the tangent of that angle is going to just get bigger and bigger.

540
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:39,680
And ultimately, it's it's not defined. It's the same as dividing by zero once you get to pi halves.

541
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:53,680
And then after that, if you play the same game, it's going to be it's going to be considered a negative value, which basically comes down to the fact that the opposite and adjacent sides of our triangle are going to be considered to have separate signs.

542
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:04,540
So the very last thing that I want to talk about, like I said, is the question of where does cosine squared of theta show up in our image?

543
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,860
Because this is the very thing that we opened with is trying to understand cosine squared.

544
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:15,400
And you might think, oh, if we can see that in our image somewhere, maybe it really reveals why it looks like a miniature version of the cosine wave.

545
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:27,740
Now, one of the naive things, not naive, but one of the first things you might try to do is pull up the original cosine animation that we had or something like it and say, oh, well, I'm going to take that cosine length and literally square it.

546
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:38,520
I'm just going to draw the square based on that. And if I were to do this, where I'm going to plot the length of that horizontal line and I'm also going to plot the area of that square, it's a little bit complicated.

547
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:48,460
It certainly shows us what we already saw before, which is that the square of that value looks like another cosine wave.

548
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:54,520
But this is something where just by staring at the image, it actually doesn't yield much insight.

549
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:00,800
I think oftentimes in geometry or math, when you simply write down the definition of things, the answer pops out.

550
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,940
This is a sign that again, it's not trivial.

551
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:12,100
It's very unclear why the way that that square, that literal square would oscillate is going to be related to cosine, much less cosine of two theta.

552
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,820
So it's going to come from somewhere else inside our image.

553
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,740
And for that, let me go ahead and draw a much bigger triangle for ourselves.

554
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,420
Let's say we've got one of these guys that was living inside the unit circle.

555
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,760
This, by the way, I think is the most exciting part of the lecture.

556
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,020
So if there was just one thing that you were going to stick around for, I would say that this is the thing that you should.

557
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,600
Because it gives a very sneaky proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

558
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,260
It might feel like a circular argument at first, but I assure you that it's not.

559
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,580
And I also assure you that the word circular was not meant as a pun there.

560
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:58,100
So remember, if that's our angle theta, then one of our side lengths is sine of theta and the other one is cosine of theta.

561
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:12,540
Let me ask you, if I draw, well, okay, so, you know, the example we had earlier was this leaning tower thing where we kind of imagined casting a shadow from a leaning tower onto the ground.

562
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:18,700
This is sort of going to flip it on its head and say, well, this angle theta between them, who's to say who's the tower and who's the ground?

563
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:24,320
What if I wanted to have a light source over here and I wanted to cast a shadow from the ground onto the tower?

564
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,320
A nice perpendicular line in this direction.

565
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,360
That way my angle theta is going to do double duty for me.

566
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:40,200
It's describing the angle between these two lines, but in one context, this ground line was the adjacent side. It was the short side.

567
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,260
But now, if I ask you a question like, what is this side length?

568
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:53,180
The shadow that the ground lays down on the tower, if that's not more confusing than I want it to be, what are we going to get?

569
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:08,980
Well, in terms of this smaller right triangle that we've just created, by definition, the cosine of that angle is going to be the adjacent side, the thing we want to know, maybe I'll call it s for shadow again.

570
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,300
I'm going to write down what it equals.

571
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,100
It's going to be the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.

572
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,760
But for this little triangle, the hypotenuse is cosine.

573
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:27,820
So it's divided by the cosine of theta, which means cosine squared of theta, dumb convention, is equal to the answer that we want.

574
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,260
Let me just write it down in a different color to really emphasize.

575
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,980
Cosine squared of theta.

576
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:46,320
And let me emphasize, this is not using the Pythagorean theorem in any way. This is not having the cosine squared arrive because we were assuming that this sits on a circle where x squared plus y squared equals one.

577
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,940
We're just using the definition of cosine twice to cast one shadow and then to cast another.

578
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,840
Now, you can probably see where this is going, do the same thing for the sine of theta.

579
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,840
So another place where theta shows up in our diagram is right here.

580
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,760
And a way that you can see that is that this angle plus something must equal 90 degrees.

581
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:14,760
But this other something plus r theta had to be the remaining angles of the little right triangle that we had.

582
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:31,760
Or you might think up here, I could just give it a different name. If I called this other angle alpha, then we know that alpha plus theta, alpha plus theta plus 90 degrees, or pi halves, if you want to get used to the better conventions, has to equal pi.

583
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,660
It's got to equal 180 degrees.

584
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:43,580
This is maybe confusing. Just think alpha plus theta plus pi halves. In the back of your mind, you can go to 90 degrees if that's something you want for comfort.

585
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:54,520
But that also implies that when we have a new right triangle sitting here, this little angle here has got to be theta because it's alpha plus 90 plus something, so that something's got to be theta.

586
01:08:55,220 --> 01:09:02,040
Now, the reason I have stated that so much is because we're going to play our same shadow casting game to figure out what this side length is.

587
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:16,960
Now, with respect to that, we have sine of theta of this theta in particular is the opposite, the new shadow we don't know, I'll call it s prime, is equal to s prime divided by the hypotenuse.

588
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:25,920
Well, on this smaller right triangle, what was the long side has become the hypotenuse, so that's sine of theta. Sine of theta.

589
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:35,620
Which means sine squared of theta is our other shadow. This here is sine squared of theta.

590
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:50,080
So that's kind of cool. The side length, which was by definition one, because we've always been rescaling our triangles such that the hypotenuse is one, can be broken down into one part that's cosine squared and another part that's sine squared.

591
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:59,260
And the way to break that down is to just draw a single line, the perpendicular projection from our corner point onto that hypotenuse.

592
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:19,780
So what that means is every time you see a unit circle out in the wild, which I'm sure you do pretty regularly, and you draw the standard triangle to understand sine and cosine, so that height is going to be sine, the x coordinate is going to be cosine, and our hypotenuse is always one.

593
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:29,520
So that hypotenuse is one, this is theta. And you ask yourself, where is cosine squared in this diagram? Where is sine squared?

594
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:47,160
You can just draw a little perpendicular line here, and the part on the bottom is cosine squared. So, cos squared of theta is this length, this length here.

595
01:10:48,780 --> 01:11:02,480
And what we'll do in a future lecture, actually, I want to talk about geometry and geometry proofs, and in particular, one that comes up all the time, I've used it in many past videos, it's high time we just sit down and say, how would you prove it, is the inscribed angle theorem.

596
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:16,460
So, after showing you how complex numbers play into things next time, I want to turn back to this particular diagram to give another very intuitive understanding for the identity that you found simply by playing around with graphs at the very beginning here,

597
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:24,700
which, again, is a very non-trivial identity, that the cosine squared of some value is one plus the cosine of two times that value divided by two.

598
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:37,560
The more standard way you see it, by the way, if you were to look this up in a textbook, instead of writing this as x, this is commonly written as something like alpha halves for some angle, and then 2x would be alpha.

599
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:52,480
And the whole thing ends up looking like cosine of alpha divided by two is equal to the square root of one plus cosine of alpha divided by two.

600
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:59,580
I, for one, I have such trouble memorizing the trig identities, and I always would just sort of re-derive them on the fly.

601
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:09,980
And this is one where I think the easiest way to re-derive is to practice kind of smooshing around graphs in your head, when you have the one key insight, which is that squaring cosine gets you a smaller cosine graph.

602
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:15,440
And the next time I'll show you how complex numbers help you kind of re-derive a bunch of other identities on the fly.

603
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:19,940
But this one in particular, I just always had trouble remembering. It's called the half-angle identity.

604
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:31,600
And I just think it's delightful that before you even know any trigonometry, simply hopping over to something like Desmos and being a little bit playful, that, I mean, that lands you on a highly non-trivial fact.

605
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:41,240
And once again, it's one that indicates that cosine is related to exponentials. That's not obvious, and hopefully next time we can start to get a glimpse of why.

606
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:49,780
Thanks for sticking around this long. Thank you once again to Cam and Ben Eater, who have been making the item pool magic behind the scenes to get us our live statistics.

607
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:57,160
And I'll see you go at the very end. I had almost everything down until the very end. I will see you all on Friday.
