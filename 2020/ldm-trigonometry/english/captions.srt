1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,722
My end goal for this lecture and the following lecture is to draw 

2
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:07,220
for you a connection between trigonometry and complex numbers.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,911
And I really do think when you understand that connection between the two, 

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,240
it strengthens your understanding of both of them.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,460
So for this lecture, we're just going to go back to the basics on some 

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,300
of the trigonometric functions, how to think about them, what they mean.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,056
And to dive into it, what I want to first do is imagine that you don't actually 

8
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:28,138
know any trigonometry yet, but show how just playing around with a graphing 

9
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:32,220
calculator can lead you to come to some pretty non-trivial facts about trig.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,520
So for example, let's say you've never heard of the cosine function.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,732
But then one day, you know, it comes up, you hear someone talking about physics, 

12
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:43,340
and they mention a sinusoidal wave and the cosine function and things like that.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,188
So you go to a graphing calculator, something like Desmos, 

14
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:49,260
and you just poke it in and say, okay, what does this thing look like?

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,458
Now before seeing its definition, you can understand, oh, yeah, 

16
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:56,229
I can see how this might be relevant to waves and wave type dynamics that people 

17
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,160
might want to study.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,775
It's got kind of a cycling phenomenon to it, so maybe anytime people 

19
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:02,789
are studying something associated with cycling, 

20
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,810
you could play around with the graph and do all the things that you can 

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,860
with any normal function.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,080
If I tweak the input, it kind of squishes it, right?

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,932
So as I put a bigger constant in front of that input X, 

24
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:15,360
it squishes things, gives it a higher frequency.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,160
Okay, that's all well and good.

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,920
You could stretch it out in the Y direction by messing with the output.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,435
Now what I want to do though is point out something very interesting 

28
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:29,480
about the cosine graph that is something you might want to take note of.

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,340
So what I'm going to do is square it, and I don't want to show you what it looks like yet.

30
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,760
I want you to predict what it's going to look like when we take cosine of X squared, okay?

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,320
And in particular, I'm just going to have you focus in on the region from 0 up to 2 pi.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,074
So again, if you're just playing around, what you would notice is 

33
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,220
cosine is clearly related to pi and probably circles in some way.

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,410
So it takes a dip down to pi, down to negative 1 at pi, 

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,020
excuse me, and then it comes right back up to 1 at the input 2 pi.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,980
So what I want you to do is predict what it looks like when we take cosine of X squared.

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,820
And let's actually do this as one of our fun live question dynamics, okay?

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,633
So getting rid of our Randy, which was a very informative thing for me, 

39
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,840
let's dump into our very first genuinely mathematical quiz question.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,700
What does it say here?

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,920
What will the graph of f of X equals cosine of X squared look like?

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,680
Okay, and it looks like A as an option has these sort of valleys where in all of 

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,120
these it might be a little small to read, but the range is going from 0 to about 2 pi.

44
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,797
So in A it hits 1 and then it goes down and hits 1 again at 

45
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:41,080
the input pi and kind of goes down with these flat valleys.

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,980
B has a similar behavior for when it hits 1 and 0, but it's a little spikier.

47
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,340
So it's kind of bouncing right off that x-axis.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,500
C looks just like a sinusoidal wave.

49
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,853
Okay, it looks like the same kind of wave, but it's all positive and it's, 

50
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:02,740
it goes from 1 down to 0, then up to 1 in the span of pi.

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,000
And then D kind of gets scrunched together in the x-direction 

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,780
and starts going more rapidly as you move farther to the right.

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Okay, so it looks like we've got a lot of answers coming in.

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,901
A fair bit of consensus towards the top, but it's not, 

55
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,060
definitely not a unanimous decision on this one where people are going.

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,120
So it seems like there's one most popular answer and then two 

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,780
that kind of tie closely for the silver and the bronze medals.

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,584
So I'm going to give you just a couple more seconds here if you want to change 

59
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:38,140
your mind or if you want to go to 3b1b.co slash live and answer this as we're going.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,520
The link is also in the description if you just want to clink it there.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,500
Clink.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Click it there.

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,360
And, alright, I think that's probably enough time.

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,580
Let's go ahead and grade this.

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,120
What do you think it will be?

66
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,270
Alright, it looks like a majority of you went with C, 

67
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,680
which is the one that looks like a sinusoidal wave.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,046
The second most common one was A, which has a similar shape, 

69
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:04,380
but it's kind of more flattened out on the bottom.

70
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,120
Third most common was B, and then the last most common was D.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,275
And I think that's pretty good instincts because A, B, and C, 

72
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:16,549
which were the top three choices there, if we go back and look at our actual cosine 

73
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,078
graph itself, what you'll notice is that at the input 0 it's 1, so when you square that, 

74
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,300
1 squared should stay 1.

75
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,640
Similarly, negative 1 when you square that, that should come up to 1 as well.

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,940
And then positive 1 at the end of its cycle, again that's 1.

77
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,840
So the idea that no matter what you're going to get something that dips down to 0, 

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,240
then up to 1, down to 0, and up to 1 should make sense.

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,260
But the specific shape is what we don't know.

80
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,480
Turns out, as you just saw, the answer is C.

81
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,560
So if we go over here and reveal, it looks just like a little cosine wave.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,625
Which is weird, if you think about it, because what we're doing when we square something 

83
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,960
is affecting the output, it's affecting stuff happening in the y-direction, right?

84
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,495
But to get another cosine wave that's oscillating more quickly, 

85
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:03,060
it's not at all clear that that's what would happen.

86
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,703
And using this, even before you know what the cosine of x means, 

87
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:11,468
if you're just playing around being kind of childlike with your graphing calculator, 

88
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:15,560
you can discover a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometric functions.

89
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,655
And then as we start defining them and getting into them, 

90
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:22,280
you will appreciate just how non-trivial it is, because it really is not obvious.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,780
So for this, I want to take us to a second question.

92
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,356
Okay, and I look at this graph hard, okay, and remember 

93
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:32,380
that it looks like a scaled-down version of the cosine graph.

94
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,474
And what I'm going to want you to do is basically come up with an identity based on that, 

95
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:38,780
okay?

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,420
So question number two, what does it say?

97
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,814
Working from the assumption that the graph of cosine of x squared looks like a 

98
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:53,140
scaled-down version of the graph of cosine of x, which of the following equations is true?

99
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,644
Okay, now because this might take a little moment for you guys to work out, 

100
00:05:57,644 --> 00:06:00,500
pencil and paper, highly encourage you to actively work it out.

101
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,432
I'm just going to give you maybe 30 to 60 seconds to start penciling through, 

102
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:09,625
noodling it out, and let's introduce a little bit of pause and ponder 

103
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,100
music just to put us in the problem-solving mood, I think.

104
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,840
So which one of these reflects the fact the cosine 

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,700
of x squared is kind of a scaled version of itself?

106
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,045
So it looks like we still have a fair bit of answers rolling in, 

107
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:10,032
and I don't want you to feel rushed, so I'm going to give you time to figure it out for 

108
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:11,120
yourself if you want to.

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,793
While you're answering this, it looks like we've 

110
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,060
got ourselves a question that's rolled in, okay?

111
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,060
So Diego Mathemagician, love the name, asks, what is the new music?

112
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,460
Great question.

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,650
So the guy who usually composes the music for the channel, 

114
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,460
his name is Vince, Vince Rubenetti.

115
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,060
I told him that we were doing these streams, and I mentioned I wanted kind of a jeopardy.

116
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,060
Here, I'll turn it down so that I can talk over it.

117
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,560
Vince, your music is great, but I want to talk about it a little bit more.

118
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,207
I wanted just a jeopardy type theme, but mixed with the usual three blue and brown vibe, 

119
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:49,060
so a little clock ticking, and I think it really puts you in the problem-solving mood.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,977
Now that is probably enough to noodle this one out, 

121
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,760
so I'm going to go ahead and grade this.

122
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,340
And I'm guessing the majority have gotten it correct.

123
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,200
Okay, great job.

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,441
So to the 3,165 of you that answered B, which is that it's one half cosine of 2x plus 1, 

125
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,380
congratulations, you're absolutely correct.

126
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,773
But let's think about how you might do that in a step-by-step way, 

127
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:13,400
and this is one of those things that, again, if you're just 

128
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,940
noodling around on a graphing calculator, you can come to.

129
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,519
So what I might do is take, here, I'll just go ahead and write a new cosine function, 

130
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:20,760
okay?

131
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,300
And then I'm going to start manipulating it.

132
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,760
So cosine of x, we won't look at the original.

133
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,217
The first thing you'd notice is, okay, we want to make it entirely positive 

134
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,240
because that's what the other one is, so maybe I'm going to shift it up by one, okay?

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,020
And that makes it all positive.

136
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,495
But now it's twice as high as the other graph we're looking at, 

137
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:41,020
so if we want to make it equal, we might chop it in half.

138
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,620
But it still cycles once every 2 pi, right?

139
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,660
You have to go from 0 all the way up to 2 pi before this blue graph that 

140
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,840
we're looking at goes through the cycle from 1 down to 0 now, back up to 1.

141
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,520
So the last step is going to be to squish it in the x direction.

142
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,141
And sometimes people find this very counterintuitive that you scale up that input, 

143
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:07,860
that you multiply it by 2 in order to squish it.

144
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,738
But what's really going on, if you think it through, 

145
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:14,539
is we want to say instead of taking 2 pi to go through your full cycle, 

146
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,760
I want you to go through that cycle as x ranges from 0 to pi.

147
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,571
So if we make that input 2x, then the thing being plugged 

148
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,180
into cosine will go from 0 to 2 pi as x goes from 0 up to pi.

149
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,800
And what you'll look at is the graphs are right on top of each other, right?

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,133
Which is very cool, right on top of each other, 

151
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:34,600
and that means you've discovered a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometry.

152
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,055
And it's worth writing down because it's one of those 

153
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:41,100
things that comes up later in a very hard to memorize way.

154
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,320
I always had a little bit of trouble actually remembering what this thing is.

155
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:52,646
So, writing down what you just found, cosine of x squared, okay, 

156
00:09:52,646 --> 00:10:02,420
is equal to 1 plus cosine of 2x, which is basically saying increase its frequency.

157
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,040
So we're going to double its frequency and then add 1 to it.

158
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,500
So it's going to shift above that y-axis, and then we're going to divide that by 2, okay?

159
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,879
So this is a fact that we're going to turn back to at the very end of the lecture, 

160
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,414
and as you start to get an appreciation for what the cosine means, 

161
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:21,580
it becomes clearer and clearer just how non-obvious this is.

162
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,883
And in particular, the one thing I want you to take note of is the weird 

163
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:30,096
fact that we've got this function that when you square it, it's not equal to, 

164
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,500
but it's somewhat related to the idea of scaling up that input.

165
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,801
Now if you were clever, there is another function that behaves very similarly to this, 

166
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:42,180
where when you square it, it's the same as doing something to its input.

167
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,520
And this actually takes us to our next question.

168
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,961
So let's go ahead and move past from this one, okay, 

169
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:52,436
and I'm going to ask you something that seems very unrelated to trigonometry, 

170
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:56,740
and it'll take us until the next lecture to realize just how related it is.

171
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,120
What does our question say?

172
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,000
Which of the following functions satisfies f of 2x is equal to f of x squared?

173
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,860
So when you plug in 2x, it should be the same as f of x squared.

174
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,282
Option A, square root of 1 minus x squared, option B, 

175
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:22,320
log of x, option C, x squared, and option D, 2 to the x.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,040
Okay, so I'm going to give you a couple minutes, a little bit to answer that.

177
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,040
We won't take too long on this one.

178
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Oh, it looks like I accidentally graded it right away.

179
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,500
Sorry for everyone who felt a little bit rushed there, my finger slipped.

180
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,700
Well, in either case, it's now been revealed that the answer is D, 2 to the x.

181
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,615
Okay, and we can see this again if we go and just 

182
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:49,800
play around a little bit in our Desmos graphs.

183
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,400
So what we might do is pop over here and let me plug in 2 to the x.

184
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,160
Look at what that graph looks like.

185
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,340
So let's not look at our cosines anymore, 2 to the x.

186
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,720
And indeed, if I take this whole thing and I square it.

187
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,960
On the one hand, squaring usually does a kind of stretching motion in the y direction.

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,540
But what's neat about this shape is that it's exactly the same as taking 2 to the 2x.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,839
And if you know anything about exponents, this kind of makes 

190
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,680
sense because that 2 up here can get distributed into that x.

191
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,153
But what this means is that exponents have this funny property that when you square them, 

192
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:31,040
it's a lot like scaling the input.

193
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,601
And of course, the reason I bring that up is that you're 

194
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,720
looking at something very similar when it comes to cosine.

195
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,934
Just before, just by playing around with graphs, before you even know what they mean, 

196
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:44,917
you can have this tiny little instinct in your head that says, maybe, 

197
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,820
just maybe, cosine is somehow related to exponents.

198
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,440
It's not at all obvious how it is, but it absolutely is.

199
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
And that's one of the things that I'd like to get to by the end of the second lecture.

200
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
We won't get to the end of there today.

201
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,870
So with all of that, I think it's high time that we 

202
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,540
actually talk about what sine and cosine actually are.

203
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,406
I don't want to come in assuming that you necessarily know that already, 

204
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,460
so let's have a little moment to go back to the basics.

205
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,144
I think one of the best summaries of trigonometry that I ever heard, 

206
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,501
and this was on Reddit, but I cannot for the life of me find it, 

207
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:22,530
or remember who originally said this, is you think that it's about triangles, 

208
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,080
but really it's about circles.

209
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,220
And this is absolutely true.

210
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,637
I think between the time when I very first learned about trigonometry and now, 

211
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:35,359
I think my mind shifted from fundamentally thinking of a triangular-based definition, 

212
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,940
which we'll talk about in a moment, to circles.

213
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,788
And let me just show you what I mean with respect to the circles, 

214
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,125
because that's the one that explains how it comes up in physics, 

215
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,360
and often how to get intuitions about where the values will be.

216
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,537
So instead of our Desmos graph, I'm going to go 

217
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,900
ahead and pull up a couple animations here.

218
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,755
So in this one, I'll explain what sine of theta is, where theta is the input, 

219
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:04,440
and it's going to be a measure of how far you've walked around a circle.

220
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,534
So I want you to imagine that you've started on the 

221
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:10,340
rightmost side of a circle that has a radius of one, okay?

222
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,868
And then as you walk around at a constant rate, as a function of how far you've walked, 

223
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:20,580
we're going to graph your height, which is to say your y-axis on this grid.

224
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,080
Maybe you'd think of it as the distance between you and the x-axis.

225
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,320
And as you do that, you get this wave that oscillates.

226
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,483
And it kind of makes sense how it's just going to oscillate on and on, 

227
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:32,580
no matter how far you walk.

228
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,668
Which is why, when we go back over to the Desmos graph, 

229
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:39,529
and you think of something like cosine of x, not the squared version, 

230
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,397
let's just do the plain vanilla cosine x, you know, 

231
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:45,100
it goes on forever continuing to cycle like this.

232
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,000
And I guess here I'm explaining sine of x, but it works the same way.

233
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,560
If instead I type sine of x, we get a similar looking shape.

234
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
The only difference is that it starts at zero.

235
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,500
And we can take a look to explain why here, because if by definition, 

236
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,460
if it's giving your y-coordinate when you start off to the right, 

237
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,040
it starts at zero before slowly increasing.

238
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:08,620
Okay?

239
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,001
Now by contrast, cosine, it's defined very similarly, 

240
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:15,680
but it's giving you the x-coordinate as you walk around that circle.

241
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
So the distance to the vertical line.

242
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,531
And in that context, it starts off at one, and then as you walk around the circle, 

243
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:28,080
your distance from that y-axis, your x-coordinate, is going to get lower.

244
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,140
It ultimately gets down to negative one before it starts increasing again.

245
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,060
Okay?

246
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,800
So this is how you might think of sine and cosine with respect to circles.

247
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,460
The input is a kind of distance around a unit circle, 

248
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,740
but you can think of that as an angle.

249
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,040
And we're going to talk in a moment about the difference between degrees and radians.

250
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,795
But when you're thinking about walking around the circle, if it has a radius of one, 

251
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,620
you can think of that input as being the literal distance that you walk.

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,900
So as an example, notice what happens when we get to the distance pi.

253
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:01,900
Okay?

254
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,360
pi gives you the semi-circumference of one of these circles.

255
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,328
If it's got a radius of one, then the distance that it takes to get halfway around is pi, 

256
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:16,000
which is why at that input pi, you see the output go to negative one.

257
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,440
At half of that, if you turn to 90 degree angle, 

258
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,390
which means walking around a distance of pi halves, 

259
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,660
that's why cosine is zero at that point.

260
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,221
So now I'm going to ask you another question where we're going to consider 

261
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,700
the input in terms of this idea of a distance around the unit circle.

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,760
And I'm just going to have you guess at some of the values for sine and cosine.

263
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
So we'll go ahead and pull up our quiz again.

264
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,770
And this time, let's get it up on here.

265
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,680
What does our question say?

266
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,160
Without looking it up or using a calculator, which of the following is true?

267
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,577
And it's reminding us that that input 3 is going to be considered in radians, 

268
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,048
which is to say the distance around the unit circle, 

269
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,240
if you're just walking along at the arc length.

270
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:11,099
Option A, the sine of 3 is around 0.14 and the cosine of 3 is around 0.99.

271
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,819
B, the sine of 3 is around 0.14 and the cosine of 3 is around negative 0.99.

272
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,579
C, sine of 3 is around 0.99, cosine of 3 is around 0.14.

273
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,200
And D, sine of 3 is around negative 0.99 and cosine of 3 is around 0.14.

274
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,700
Okay, so just to give you a little moment to think that through.

275
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,384
It seems like there's not a 100% consensus on 

276
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,800
this question and answers are still rolling in.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,700
So I'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit of pause and ponder music.

278
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,540
I'll let you just think about it.

279
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,040
I don't want you to feel rushed here.

280
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,320
Okay, so I think this is probably a pretty good time to start grading things.

281
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,580
So the correct answer is B.

282
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,660
And it looks like the majority of you got the correct answer, 

283
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,440
which is to say that sine is 0.14 and cosine is negative 0.99.

284
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,660
Now the specific numbers here don't matter.

285
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,904
What's actually relevant is just kind of whether it's positive or 

286
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:46,040
negative and whether it's very close to 1 or if it's closer to 0.

287
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,549
So if we think through what this might mean in the context of our graphs here, 

288
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,974
the cosine, which remember is measuring the x-coordinate of 

289
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:56,600
your little dot as you walk around the circle.

290
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,280
What is that going to be when you input 3?

291
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,320
Well, what does it mean to walk 3 units around the circle?

292
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,560
Well, like I just mentioned, walking pi units around the circle gets you halfway around.

293
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,825
This is really the way to think about pi is you've got a unit circle, 

294
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,060
it takes you halfway around.

295
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,660
So to walk 3 units is going to be something a little bit shy of that.

296
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,423
Okay, and if you notice, there's very little change in 

297
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:23,760
the x direction as you're at that left side of the circle.

298
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,393
So when it approaches 1, it gets really close 

299
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:28,900
to 1 and then it doesn't really change that much.

300
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:43,040
So maybe it shouldn't be too surprising that our cosine of 3 turned out to be around 0.99.

301
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,140
Which, same game, but it's measuring your y-coordinate.

302
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,684
When you walk almost halfway around, which is to say almost pi radians, 

303
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:55,260
well, there's still a little bit of height left.

304
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,300
And importantly, it's positive because you're still above that x-axis.

305
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,761
So when we turn back to our question, the only thing differentiating our answers was that 

306
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:08,320
some of them would switch whether sine or cosine was the one that's close to negative 1.

307
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,400
And the others would just switch the sine, s-i-g-n, whether it's positive or negative.

308
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,700
So congratulations to the 3,152 of you who got that one correct.

309
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,361
So that's loosely how you might think about sine and 

310
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,880
cosine if we're coming at it from the direction of circles.

311
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,661
But this is very different from how it's usually taught if we're doing things like 

312
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:32,260
in a typical high school class where you start off thinking about right triangles.

313
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,300
One is not better, they're just very different and worth understanding the connection.

314
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:42,612
So the classic thing when it comes to trig functions is a little 

315
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:49,800
statement that everyone has ringing through their head called SOH CAH TOA.

316
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,745
And what you're supposed to remember from this is if we have a right triangle, 

317
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:58,380
so let me go ahead and draw a right triangle.

318
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,280
So we know one of the angles is 90 degrees.

319
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,067
And if you know another one of the angles, theta, 

320
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,840
then consider one of the sides to be the hypotenuse.

321
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,020
And then you ask what of the other two legs is adjacent to that angle, 

322
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,880
and we label it a for adjacent, and which of them is opposite.

323
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,882
So then SOH CAH TOA, if that's a phrase that you remember running through your head, 

324
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:31,269
tells you that the sine of this angle, this is the definition of sine for some kind of 

325
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:36,780
angle that we input, is for such a right triangle, it's the opposite over the hypotenuse.

326
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,280
That's what this is telling us, opposite over hypotenuse.

327
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,780
Similarly, the cosine of that angle is going to equal the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

328
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,800
So that would be adjacent over hypotenuse.

329
00:21:51,780 --> 00:22:00,340
And then the tangent of that angle is going to be the opposite over the adjacent.

330
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,960
So that opposite side O over the adjacent side.

331
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,126
So that is the classic thing to remember if students come out of a trig class, 

332
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,080
if they know one thing, they typically know SOH CAH TOA.

333
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,150
And to give us an example of how you might apply this, 

334
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,732
I'm going to go ahead and pull up another question here for you, 

335
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:22,700
which is going to ask us about a leaning tower, a leaning tower of Pisa.

336
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,240
Clearing out the last one, let's read what our new question has to say.

337
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,620
Suppose that a tower is 100 meters high.

338
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,840
After several years, the tower starts to lean.

339
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,480
So instead of making a 90 degree angle with the ground, it makes an 80 degree angle.

340
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,584
When the sun is directly overhead, what is the 

341
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,980
length of the shadow cast by this leaning tower?

342
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,300
Okay, the length of the shadow cast by this leaning tower.

343
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,800
I would highly encourage you to try drawing this out yourself.

344
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,998
I'm absolutely going to draw it for you in a moment, 

345
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:03,480
but it's more fun if you're engaged and if you have a pencil and paper to noodle it out.

346
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,600
You could also try to imagine it in your head if you want.

347
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,092
But for me, at least, I always think much more clearly once I have pencil and paper, 

348
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:11,640
no matter how much I think I can think things through in my head.

349
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,720
So let's give you a little pause and ponder time on this one.

350
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:48,240
Looks like we have some very strong consensus on this one, which is very reassuring.

351
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:54,815
And I guess one thing that should maybe go without saying, 

352
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:58,795
especially given that I've turned the super chat or the live chat into the very 

353
00:23:58,795 --> 00:23:59,840
aggressive slow mode.

354
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,320
This is most fun if you don't know what the majority of people are already thinking.

355
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,880
The whole idea of the statistics is right now you can see there's a bandwagon.

356
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,931
There's 2600 people who are voting for one of the answers who think that's it, 

357
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,580
but we don't know what one of those answers is.

358
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,440
So if you have the answer, try not to just blurted out in the live chat.

359
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,182
That's kind of the equivalent of a student in a classroom where when the teacher asks 

360
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:27,486
something, rather than raising their hand to ask it or submitting it quietly, 

361
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:28,080
just shouting.

362
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,800
I get it.

363
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,260
You're excited.

364
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,220
You really want to do it.

365
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,220
But in this case, it's a little bit more fun if we have the slow reveal.

366
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,360
So that's probably enough time for people to have rolled their answers in.

367
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,520
Let's go ahead and see what the majority has submitted.

368
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,000
And the correct answer is B, which is 100 times the cosine of 80.

369
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,620
And it looks like the second most common answer was A, which is 100 times the sine of 80.

370
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,706
So it looks like you guys correctly knew that you were 

371
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,258
multiplying it by one of these trigonometric functions, 

372
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:05,540
but there might have just been a little swap up for which one was which.

373
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,860
So let's think this through.

374
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,380
Okay, let's go back to our paper.

375
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,280
And our question had us imagine a tower which is 100 meters tall.

376
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,460
And specifically, it said it was 100 meters tall and then it started tilting.

377
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,040
So we can think of the length of the towers 100 meters.

378
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,240
That's not necessarily how far its new top is off of the ground.

379
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,640
And then it has us imagine that there's the sun directly overhead.

380
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,640
Okay, so it's going to be casting a shadow perpendicular to the ground.

381
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,700
That's what gives us our nice right triangle.

382
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,460
And it further specified that the angle here was 80 degrees.

383
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,737
Okay, so the thing we want to know is this side here, the length of the shadow, 

384
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:49,900
which if we look at our SOHCAHTOA, that's the adjacent side.

385
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,699
So we might write for ourselves cosine of this angle, which is 80 degrees, 

386
00:25:55,699 --> 00:26:00,520
is equal to that adjacent side, the thing that we want to know.

387
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,903
I'll just call it x, or maybe I'll call it s for shadow, 

388
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:08,740
try to give our variables readable meanings, divided by the hypotenuse, which is 100.

389
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:18,260
So that means that the shadow, once we rearrange, is 100 times the cosine of 80 degrees.

390
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,780
Now already this feels very different from the thought of trigonometry via circles.

391
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,480
Like I said, you start to think about it in terms of triangles, later it comes to circles.

392
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,920
One of the main differences here is that we're dealing with a different unit, right?

393
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,140
Here I was saying degrees, and that's very natural when we're in the context of triangles.

394
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,092
We could also talk about angles in terms of radians, 

395
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:43,546
like I'll say in a moment, but when humans assign numbers and 

396
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:47,780
numerical systems to things, we really like whole numbers between 0 and 100.

397
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,960
We just love that.

398
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,006
Instead of thinking of proportions, we think in terms of percentages, 

399
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:55,440
which is the same thing, but it just turns it to whole numbers between 0 and 100.

400
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,100
When we think about like sound with decibels, which scales a whole bunch 

401
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,475
and it's got this crazy exponential pattern to it, 

402
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,875
we logarithmically change it and we have this very awkward system that's 

403
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,229
really twisting the math behind its back, so that we can think of whole 

404
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,440
numbers between 0 and 100.

405
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,580
Same deal with what's going on with degrees, but mathematicians don't really like that.

406
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,180
They don't really like to think in terms of degrees, because it's so unnatural.

407
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,436
Instead, they want some sort of natural unit, something where you imagine if you 

408
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:25,100
talk to an alien civilization about math, they would have the same conventions.

409
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,143
So how does any of this connect to the unit circle and the idea of the 

410
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:32,400
distance around that unit circle that we were walking, like we saw earlier?

411
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,891
Well, let me just pull up a pre-printed unit circle, 

412
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:39,360
because trust me, you don't want to see me try to draw a circle.

413
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,040
What's neat here is we can, for each of these triangles, 

414
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,359
imagine rescaling it so that that hypotenuse is really 1, 

415
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,620
because all we care about are ratios of lengths of sides.

416
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,824
So we might as well say, okay, let's scale this so that the hypotenuse is 1, 

417
00:27:56,824 --> 00:28:02,786
meaning we divide everything by h, and what that's going to get us is the 

418
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:10,038
opposite side is now O over h, whatever that was, and then the adjacent side is A over h, 

419
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:14,792
meaning that the vertical component here is sine of theta, 

420
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:21,400
where theta was our angle down here, and then that bottom part is cosine of theta.

421
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,923
And if we want to think about all possible right triangles who have a hypotenuse of 1, 

422
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,662
what you might think of is taking a unit circle, 

423
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:34,961
because that's saying every point is a distance of 1 away, 

424
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,980
so think of that line as the hypotenuse of a triangle.

425
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,500
If you have a triangle with a bigger angle, it shows up there.

426
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,620
If you have a triangle with a smaller angle, it shows up there.

427
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,600
And it's as if you take all possible right triangles and you fix them so that their 

428
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,557
points are all in common, and such that their hypotenuses are all 1, you scale them down, 

429
00:28:56,557 --> 00:29:01,919
and the other tip of the triangle is going to trace out a unit circle like this, 

430
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,678
and each one of these points for the corresponding angle is going to have coordinates, 

431
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:13,040
cosine of theta as the x-coordinate, and then sine of theta for the y-coordinate.

432
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,680
And I'm just writing it vertically so I can fit it all on here.

433
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,076
Now typically, like I said, mathematicians like to think in terms of radians, 

434
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:28,096
which is really a way of saying if we know that the radius of our circle is 1, 

435
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:32,100
what is the distance that you've walked along the outside here?

436
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,397
So for example, if you were to say 180 degrees, 

437
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:44,700
which is walking halfway around the circle, that's the same as pi radians.

438
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,094
And if you were to take something like 60 degrees, 

439
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:55,440
which would maybe end up, I don't know, around here, that might be 60 degrees.

440
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,220
Well, that's a third of that.

441
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,960
You're walking a third of the half turn around the circle.

442
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:04,939
Everyone who's an enthusiast about tau is sort of yelling right now because it 

443
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:08,640
would make the conventions easier, but pi is the standard, so we're working with it.

444
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,400
It's pi, thirds, radians.

445
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,260
Okay?

446
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,614
So from this point forward, and really for a lot of your math career, 

447
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:20,843
I would encourage you to, every time you want to think in terms of degrees, 

448
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:23,818
where that makes the angle intuitive, try to translate it to radians, 

449
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:26,580
because that's going to be the more natural way to understand it.

450
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,357
And the farther you get down the road when it comes to how sine and 

451
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:33,967
cosine play into calculus, how you actually find values of them, 

452
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:38,300
almost all of the time it's easier to think of that input in terms of radians.

453
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,677
So I think it's high time I ask you a couple questions about these, 

454
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:47,300
and you might wonder, you know, how do we actually compute some of the values, right?

455
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,940
How to compute.

456
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,700
And the honest answer is that it's hard.

457
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,950
If there was an easy answer to say, oh, well, this is the formula that shows 

458
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,760
you what sine of theta is, we wouldn't have given sine of theta a fancy name.

459
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,153
We would just always work in terms of that formula, 

460
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,669
and we would call it the circle y coordinate formula, and it might get a name, 

461
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,360
but it wouldn't be a special function.

462
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,206
It wouldn't have a special button on your calculator, 

463
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:16,264
because effectively what you have to do is, before you know fancy techniques 

464
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:19,954
associated with calculus, or associated with even fancier things like 

465
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:23,801
what's known as the Kordak algorithm, you just have to have a handful of 

466
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:28,440
values that you do know that come from geometric settings where there's enough symmetry.

467
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:32,640
So for example, let's say I try to draw an equilateral triangle.

468
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,778
An equilateral triangle will be nice and symmetric, 

469
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:44,625
and we're going to be able to leverage that symmetry to figure out a concrete 

470
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,500
value of sine and cosine.

471
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,700
This looks roughly equilateral, wouldn't you say?

472
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,821
And let's say each of those side lengths is one, 

473
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:01,540
because if we get to choose our side lengths, why not one?

474
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,680
Because remember, sine and cosine have everything to do with just ratios.

475
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,460
So on an equilateral triangle, this angle here is a third of the total.

476
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,880
The total is 180 degrees, so you might think of this as 60 degrees.

477
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,429
But like I said earlier, I would encourage you to try to get in 

478
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:21,979
the habit of thinking of that instead of 60 degrees, say, okay, 

479
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:25,640
the full angle is pi, so a third of that is going to be pi thirds.

480
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,860
And then similarly, this one up here is half that angle.

481
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,340
Here's where we're leveraging that symmetry to some extent.

482
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,140
That one is 30 degrees, which in terms of radians is now a sixth of a half turn.

483
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,740
All the tau enthusiasts get very mad at this point.

484
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,020
But again, hey, it's the convention.

485
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,940
This is the thing that you should come out of a trig class 

486
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,311
knowing in your head how to think in terms of radians measured in pi, 

487
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:53,200
because that's how we often write it down in tests and such.

488
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,220
So that one will be pi sixths.

489
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,760
So one thing I might ask you now is if you can leverage the symmetry of the setup, 

490
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,884
the fact that equilateral triangles are going to be very nice and that 

491
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:09,021
the right triangle coming about from it is very nice, 

492
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:13,900
to answer something like a very concrete calculation, what is the sine of pi sixths?

493
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,720
OK, what do you think it is?

494
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,378
And in fact, let's do this as another live question, 

495
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,660
which, as you can see, I'm like a kid in a candy shop.

496
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,540
I'm just very enthusiastic with my new toy.

497
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,720
So let's go ahead and use it.

498
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,100
Pull up another question here.

499
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,480
And what does our question ask?

500
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,740
What is the sine of pi sixths, of course?

501
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,280
So again, if you want, if you're just joining now, you can hop over to 3b1b.co.

502
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:40,940
Live.

503
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,360
You can answer that.

504
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,272
I imagine the best way to do this if you're doing it live is you might be answering 

505
00:33:46,272 --> 00:33:49,660
on your phone, watching on another screen, or if you want to switch between tabs.

506
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,480
That's also good.

507
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,750
Now, while those answers are rolling in, let's take 

508
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,380
a look to see if we have anything from the audience.

509
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,060
And we do.

510
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,220
When you do maths problems, do you use pen or pencil?

511
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,080
For sure I use pencil.

512
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,760
One, I'm very error prone, so I'm going to make mistakes all the time.

513
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,260
The only reason I'm writing in pen now is because it shows up better on the camera.

514
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,829
And let me just tell you, with every stroke that I write, 

515
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:16,920
I'm deeply terrified that there's about to be an error, because I know there will be.

516
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,735
So if that terror doesn't show in the shaking of my hands, 

517
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:23,920
then you'll start to notice it from this point forward.

518
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,159
Back to our question, though.

519
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,164
It looks like we've got pretty strong consensus now, 

520
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:33,190
around 2,091 people agreeing on one of the answers, 

521
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,100
and then a pretty even split among the other ones.

522
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,437
Oh, no, no, I guess the length of the bar is a little, 

523
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,540
whoever worked on the scaling, maybe a little bit misleading.

524
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,239
It looks like one of the answers is much less popular than the other two.

525
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,639
But I guess it's considering them to start from somewhere like that.

526
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,900
Maybe we should have some axes on there indicating that.

527
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,580
So there's one very unpopular answer, and then one very popular answer.

528
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,700
So let's go ahead and see what that turns out to be.

529
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,460
Correct answer is one half.

530
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,255
Congratulations to the 2800, no, no, 2915 of you coming 

531
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:14,180
into the last minute there to pull in a correct answer.

532
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,180
Okay, so why is that the case?

533
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,140
Why is that necessarily going to be one half?

534
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,700
Well, remember, sine of pi six, we're asking SOHCAHTOA.

535
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,957
So kind of remembering your head, sine is opposite over adjacent, 

536
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,280
opposite over hypotenuse, excuse me.

537
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,920
So with respect to this smaller angle, maybe I'll change colors.

538
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,460
With respect to this smaller angle, the opposite side is this segment here.

539
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,860
And because of the symmetry of our triangle, that's going to be one half.

540
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,733
Because each side length of the equilateral triangle is one, 

541
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,180
so half of it should be one half.

542
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,820
And divided by the hypotenuse, but by definition the hypotenuse was one here.

543
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,600
So one half divided by one, it's just the same as one half.

544
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,620
Now, slightly trickier is if I'd asked you the cosine of pi six.

545
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,280
And let's do this one again as a live quiz, but maybe a little bit more quickly this time.

546
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,345
I'm going to hop over, get to our next question, and as you might expect, 

547
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:18,200
the next question is going to ask you to find the cosine of pi divided by six.

548
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,020
There we go.

549
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,042
And your options are A, one half, B, square root of two divided by two, C, 

550
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:30,640
square root of three divided by two, or D, square root of five divided by two.

551
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,600
If you can, I would highly encourage you to be keeping your own notes, right?

552
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,969
So if you wanted to kind of check back on your own piece of paper, 

553
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:40,480
you could take a look through it as you're working out these questions.

554
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:44,024
But for right now, I'm just going to give you maybe 20 seconds 

555
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:47,120
or so to kind of noodle through it, think of what it might be.

556
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
Get a little pause and ponder music going.

557
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,920
Okay.

558
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,842
Once again, it looks like we have some pretty strong consensus 

559
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:19,600
from about the same number of people that we had before.

560
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,920
So let's go ahead and grade the answers.

561
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,860
And the correct one is C, square root of three divided by two.

562
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,010
So congratulations to the 3183 of you who knew 

563
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,860
that it was square root of three divided by two.

564
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,840
Now, how do you figure something like that out?

565
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,162
Well, the trick is basically if you have one of these right triangles, 

566
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,840
if you know one of their sides, then you know both of them.

567
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,060
So let me draw a little copy for ourselves here.

568
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,737
We know that the hypotenuse is one, one of the side lengths is one half, 

569
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:56,461
and the only thing that's missing if we're thinking the cosine of 30 degrees is this 

570
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:57,240
adjacent side.

571
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,840
So because we were doing it with the angle up there, adjacent side is here.

572
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,679
Now the Pythagorean theorem tells us that that adjacent value squared 

573
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,580
plus the other leg length squared is going to equal one squared.

574
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:19,790
A hypotenuse squared, which means that value is equal to the square root of one minus, 

575
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,140
well what's one half squared?

576
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,000
It's one fourth.

577
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,740
Which means it is the square root of one minus a fourth is three fourths.

578
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,251
So we can go ahead and take the square root of 

579
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:34,200
that bottom and just leave the radical in the top.

580
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,760
And what we get is the square root of three all divided by two.

581
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,860
Now this is a value that anybody coming out of a trig class becomes very familiar with.

582
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,712
They're like, okay, if the answer isn't one half, 

583
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:46,360
it's going to be square root of three over two.

584
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,920
Or root two over two also comes up in another circumstance.

585
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,900
But this is one of those that kind of becomes burned in your memory.

586
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,400
Square root of three divided by two.

587
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:01,952
And one very important fact that's come about here that's worth highlighting is that, 

588
00:39:01,952 --> 00:39:06,979
hmm, how does the Pythagorean theorem play into our trigonometry?

589
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,558
Because if we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is one, 

590
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:14,714
and we know that one of the side lengths, let me switch to thinking with respect to 

591
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:16,100
this lower left angle again.

592
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,774
If one of the side lengths is cosine of theta, and one of them is sine of theta, 

593
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:31,821
well the Pythagorean theorem tells us that cosine of x squared plus 

594
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:36,900
sine of x squared is always equal to one squared.

595
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,800
Okay?

596
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,400
Now this is a very important identity.

597
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,240
It basically tells you if you know cosine, you know sine.

598
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,080
If you know sine, you know cosine.

599
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,240
And it also is giving you a little reminder that 

600
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,080
it's all really about the Pythagorean theorem.

601
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,080
In fact, this is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem.

602
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,991
Because if you think of how cosine and sine are defined, 

603
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:58,131
it's just defined in terms of the leg lengths of a right triangle, 

604
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:00,100
and then everything scaled down as needed.

605
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,060
Now there's one very silly convention with how we write these things.

606
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,193
So we've already started to make friends with the cosine of x squared function, 

607
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:10,460
and the fact that it's a little more interesting than you might think at first sight.

608
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,272
But you never see it written down as open parenthesis 

609
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:16,520
cosine of x closed parenthesis squared.

610
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,934
Because people don't want to write too many parenthesis, 

611
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:27,280
instead they write cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x.

612
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,220
It's all very nice.

613
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,180
How lovely.

614
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,680
We don't have to write too many symbols.

615
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,180
What a wonderful convention.

616
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,877
Except for the fact that literally every other time in math you see 

617
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:45,500
something written as f squared of x, what that means is not f of x squared.

618
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,300
That's almost never what it means.

619
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,270
Instead, what it's supposed to mean for most of math is taking a 

620
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:57,240
function and applying it to itself, like layering it over itself.

621
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,100
That's what that 2 usually refers to.

622
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,188
Sometimes later on it refers to the second derivative, 

623
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:04,640
especially if it has some parenthesis around it.

624
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,640
But the idea is that it's very different from the convention in trigonometry.

625
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,892
Trigonometry is just flying by its own rules and saying, yeah, yeah, 

626
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:15,240
we've got our own conventions for what it means when you put a little 2 up there.

627
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,440
I understand some students will be confused, but I'm trigonometry.

628
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,180
I don't care.

629
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,880
I'm moving forward with my conventions.

630
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,400
And that's fine.

631
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,040
You get used to it.

632
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,120
This is the standard way that you'll end up seeing it.

633
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,264
What I was writing earlier when we were thinking about the cosine squared function, 

634
00:41:31,264 --> 00:41:36,385
which again is very interesting, you would almost always see it written as cos squared 

635
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:36,680
of x.

636
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,869
Now, very interesting is that this is not just a consequence of the 

637
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:46,200
Pythagorean theorem that gives us a relation between our trig functions.

638
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,580
At the end of the lecture, I want to show you how you can use 

639
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,760
trig functions to prove the Pythagorean theorem in a sneaky way.

640
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:53,900
And it's pretty sneaky.

641
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,762
Like it's not one of the common proofs that you'll see that's associated with, 

642
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:00,280
you know, rearranging triangles or anything like that.

643
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,160
But it is very visually satisfying.

644
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,040
So that's something that we'll get to by the end of the lecture.

645
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,972
But in the meantime, I want to think through a 

646
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,900
couple more of our of our trig function questions.

647
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,880
OK, so we kind of come back up here.

648
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,180
We just found cosine of pi six, which is square root of three over two.

649
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,120
But let's answer it for a couple more complicated ones.

650
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,528
So far, I'm dealing only with angles that were between zero and 90 degrees, 

651
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:28,740
or I should say between zero and pi halves.

652
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,900
But let's try a question that's a little bit different from that.

653
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:40,880
And what if I instead said cosine of negative two pi over three?

654
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,125
OK, now that's one that is hard to think of in terms of triangles, 

655
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,900
because what does it mean to have a negative angle?

656
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,036
So this is a good reminder that cosine and sine, 

657
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,640
even if you think they're about triangles, are really about circles.

658
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,319
And remember, if you walk all the way around the circle, and if it has a radius of one, 

659
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,120
walking all the way around the circle is going to take you a distance of two pi.

660
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,738
So if you want to think about two pi thirds, what you might start by doing is 

661
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:14,780
chopping the triangle into thirds and then using that to help guide the intuitions.

662
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,260
But again, I kind of want to do this as a live quiz.

663
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,200
So let's go ahead and pull up the next question.

664
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:26,940
And have you guys answer this for me.

665
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,600
What do you think the cosine of two pi divided by three?

666
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,580
Let's go ahead and pull it up.

667
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,220
Cosine of negative two pi divided by three.

668
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,460
So again, if you're keeping notes, that can be very helpful.

669
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,920
You reference your notes now.

670
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,587
But just to make sure that you have enough time to think this through, 

671
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:47,720
I'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit more of that pause and ponder music.

672
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,683
It looks like one of you figured out how to submit an 

673
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:07,500
answer that is not one of the four multiple choices.

674
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,872
So other than that, we've got a very strong lead with 1152 of you, 

675
00:44:12,872 --> 00:44:15,860
as I say this, agreeing on one of the answers.

676
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,480
And then second place by about a factor of four is going to sit on another one.

677
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm curious about actually what what all the answer distribution here is.

678
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,580
I'm very curious about.

679
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,920
Oh, now we have a sixth.

680
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,000
OK, so two of you have now gone outside the realm of the 

681
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,240
typical multiple choice universe and have entered your own things.

682
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,320
Two of you sit there and say, I don't want one of your choices.

683
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,380
I figured out my own answer and you just didn't put it in your form.

684
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,820
So I'm going to figure out a way to submit it differently.

685
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,100
If only you could do that on the SAT.

686
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,540
What is the answer?

687
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,260
A through E.

688
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,620
Sir, I think the answer is J.

689
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,580
1729.

690
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,000
We got Ramanujan's constant.

691
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,440
Oh, if I pause it now, though, it's not going to stay there for a brief, glorious moment.

692
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,160
We had a wonderful number.

693
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,300
Maybe I can pause it around the year, though, because it's 1999.

694
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:08,940
2031.

695
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,480
OK, well, I've paused it in the future.

696
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,620
So the correct answer in this context is negative one half.

697
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:15,320
OK.

698
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,596
And it looks like the second most common answer was D, 

699
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:20,640
which is negative root three over two.

700
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,962
OK, so that's very good because often it's kind of this back and forth 

701
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:29,610
between whether you think it's a half or whether you think it's root three over two, 

702
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,383
because it's sort of the difference between things that feel like 30 

703
00:45:33,383 --> 00:45:36,500
degree angles and things that feel like 60 degree angles.

704
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,280
So let's take a look back at our drawing and see how we might think about this.

705
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,080
So, like I said, negative two pi divided by three.

706
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,520
That's taking us a negative distance over here.

707
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,655
And this is why cosine will be a negative number, 

708
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:54,380
because the x coordinate is pointing in the negative direction.

709
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,328
And if you want to think of this in terms of triangles, 

710
00:45:59,328 --> 00:46:02,680
I might draw this triangle here and ask, what is this angle?

711
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,819
OK, we know that it's 90 degrees plus something or pi 

712
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:10,960
halves plus something and negative two pi over thirds.

713
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,261
If we wanted to think in terms of degrees, if that's something we're more comfortable 

714
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:23,080
with, that's negative 360 divided by three degrees, which is negative 120 degrees.

715
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,967
So if it takes 120 degrees to get around here, 

716
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:32,460
then that minus the 90 degree angle between the x and y axis gives us 30 degrees.

717
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,560
OK, so then the question is, what is the cosine of this value?

718
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,820
What is the x coordinate there?

719
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,059
With your 30, 60, 90 triangles, it's just kind of a nice thing to remember 

720
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:48,720
that the shorter side is one half and the longer side is root three over two.

721
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,503
And if you forget why, it's exactly the diagram that we 

722
00:46:52,503 --> 00:46:56,220
just drew before associated with equilateral triangles.

723
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,951
Because if you imagine taking the equilateral triangle and chopping it in half, 

724
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,874
then the shorter side has length one half and then the longer 

725
00:47:03,874 --> 00:47:05,760
side comes from the Pythagorean theorem.

726
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,340
So congratulations to those of you who correctly found that.

727
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,564
Now, I want to bring back that identity that you guys found at the very beginning, 

728
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:19,589
associated with cosine squared and cosine of two thetas, 

729
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:23,994
and show how that extends our capability for making some of these computations and 

730
00:47:23,994 --> 00:47:25,480
figuring out certain values.

731
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,860
So let's remind ourselves what that actually was.

732
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm going to go back here and I'm going to pull up again the Desmos graph.

733
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,368
And remember how what we said is that cosine squared, 

734
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:40,334
which looks like this little scaled down version of cosine, 

735
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:45,820
oscillating more quickly, is the same as cosine of two x, that quicker oscillation.

736
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,540
But we had to kind of shift it and rescale it to make them equal.

737
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,284
So now we're going to use that fact that you can discover just by playing around 

738
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:57,180
with graphs to make a computation that otherwise would be pretty tricky to make.

739
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,143
And I think that when you're able to make concrete computations, 

740
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,973
it's often a reflection of the fact that you have a deeper conceptual understanding 

741
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:04,840
of what's going on.

742
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,863
So even if it's always going to be your calculator computing this, 

743
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:10,526
you're not sitting here working out cosine values by hand, 

744
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:13,731
the fact that you can is an illustrate that you understand that cosine 

745
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:15,040
function a little bit better.

746
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,200
So over on our paper, let me write down again what that identity was.

747
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,120
Let's go back to black.

748
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,680
Good old friendly black.

749
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:33,100
Cosine squared of x, using the dumb dumb convention, is one plus cosine of two x.

750
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,480
So it's kind of oscillating more quickly, all divided by two.

751
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,658
OK, so now I'm going to ask you a trickier question, 

752
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:48,680
which is going to be what is the cosine of pi twelfths?

753
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:55,500
And for those of you keeping track, pi twelfths is the same as 15 degrees.

754
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,995
So if we were doing this with a unit circle, what you might think is, 

755
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:02,440
OK, a 30 degree angle.

756
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,700
It's looking like this.

757
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,260
That's 30 degrees.

758
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,140
I'm now going to be taking half of that.

759
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,340
Half of that.

760
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,142
And I want to know the cosine of this value, which 

761
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:18,220
is going to be the x coordinate of that value.

762
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,811
And right away, you can probably make a guess that it's very close to one, 

763
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:23,440
right, because it's a small angle.

764
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,687
And the small angle means that we haven't walked that far around a circle, 

765
00:49:28,687 --> 00:49:32,262
so we haven't gotten that far away from one, especially given the fact that 

766
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:36,120
as you start to walk, almost all of your velocity is in the up and down direction.

767
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,080
All right, so cosine of pi twelfths, 15 degrees.

768
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,460
You know what's about to happen.

769
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,520
You know that this is a live quiz dynamic.

770
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,860
So let's pull it up.

771
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,880
All right.

772
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,040
What is the cosine of pi divided by 12?

773
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,820
OK, lots of answers rolling in.

774
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,180
Very fun, very exciting.

775
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,611
Again, if you just happen to be tuning in now, 

776
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:09,840
you haven't been following along before, go to 3b1b.co slash live.

777
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,880
Your answers will become part of what you're seeing on screen.

778
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,860
It affects the overall distribution.

779
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,760
This one, unlike what we had before, much less overall consensus.

780
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,700
And it definitely seems to be taking a bit more time.

781
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,356
So I'm going to just stop talking and give you some some pause and ponder moments here, 

782
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:28,760
because this one is tricky.

783
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,720
This one takes time to think through.

784
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:50,980
So.

785
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,329
Now it looks like there's a total of five of you who 

786
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:20,960
have extended beyond the realm of usual multiple choice.

787
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,918
By the way, as you guys are entering answers here, 

788
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,240
let me just say a huge thanks to Ben Eater and Cam Christensen.

789
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,160
They're the ones who actually worked on the item 

790
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,720
pool website that is making all of this possible.

791
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,213
Eater, many of you might recognize from his own YouTube channel, 

792
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:44,340
named Ben Eater about computer engineering.

793
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
If you haven't checked it out, you absolutely should.

794
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,060
And then item pool is a pretty cool thing that will 

795
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,080
be unfolding over the next coming months and year.

796
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,220
So you might want to keep your eye on that.

797
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,540
It looks like some more consensus is starting to form.

798
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,100
So I'm going to go ahead and grade this question.

799
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,760
It looks like I'm getting a phone call.

800
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,500
Awesome.

801
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,140
So the correct answer is B, which is square root of it's a very complicated thing, right?

802
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,280
Square root of one plus the square root of three over two divided by two.

803
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:27,300
So congratulations to the two to two nine of you who two to two for two to four three.

804
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,800
Two thousand two hundred forty three of you.

805
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,200
How are the answers still changing?

806
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,320
Going to have to talk to Cam and Eater about that.

807
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,720
My hands are not on this.

808
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,220
Who got that correct?

809
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,060
Now it looks like the second most common answer was A, which is of a very similar form.

810
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,000
There's just a minus sign in there.

811
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,640
So it's probably the case that while doing the arithmetic, something got flipped.

812
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,440
We're going to walk through it in a moment so you can see.

813
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,208
And a special congratulations to the two of you 

814
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:54,280
who figured out how to submit an at sign on this.

815
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,440
Oh, the three of you who submitted an at sign.

816
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,560
That's not the correct answer, but well done.

817
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,960
Well done, four of you.

818
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,740
Very nice.

819
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:02,800
All right.

820
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,260
So clearly this is a complicated answer, but where does it come from?

821
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:12,202
Well, if we look at our identity here, the key is that 

822
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:15,500
it's relating two times an angle to the angle itself.

823
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,054
So if we just plug this in for 15 degrees or for pi twelfth, 

824
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:24,460
what we would get is that the cosine squared of pi twelfth.

825
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:34,907
OK, if we enter that as X is equal to one plus the cosine of two times that value, 

826
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,520
which is pi six.

827
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,900
Pi six.

828
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,440
All divided by two.

829
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,040
Now, the cosine of pi six.

830
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:43,820
We know.

831
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,700
That's the same as our 30 degree angle here.

832
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,928
Again, when you have a 30, 60, 90 triangle, the shorter side of that, 

833
00:53:52,928 --> 00:53:57,780
which is going to be the sign in this context, the shorter side is one half.

834
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,439
And then the longer side is square root of three over two, 

835
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,721
assuming that the hypotenuse is one, which in the context of the unit circle, 

836
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:07,820
we always do assume.

837
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:13,140
So that means that we now have one plus the square root of three over two.

838
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,520
That's what the cosine of pi six was all divided by two, which means our final answer.

839
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,142
When we just want to say cosine of pi twelfth, 

840
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:27,600
no squared about it is going to be the square root of this value.

841
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,820
OK, very interesting.

842
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,000
So this is showing us that cosine and sine can get complicated.

843
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,940
We've got a handful of values like pi six and pi thirds where we can figure them out.

844
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,012
We can have even more, I won't call them trivial values, 

845
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,567
but easier to compute values like cosine of pi, 

846
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,600
where you would look at your unit circle and say, oh, pi.

847
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,280
That means I've walked halfway around.

848
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,940
So my x coordinate is negative one.

849
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,700
But outside of just a handful of values like that, they're very hard to compute by hand.

850
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,377
And in the olden days, the only way that people could compute them by 

851
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:05,160
hand for something like the existence of calculus would be measuring it.

852
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,892
You like draw out with a protractor and you try to carefully see 

853
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:12,485
what the coordinates are or layering on usage of identities like 

854
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:16,520
this over and over in ways that you can get approximate values like this.

855
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,229
And just to check ourselves, we can actually go and plug this into a calculator 

856
00:55:21,229 --> 00:55:24,121
if we wanted to, something like Desmos and just see, one, 

857
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:28,560
how big the value is and kind of confirm for ourselves that they turn out to be the same.

858
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,520
So if we pop over here and I just type something like.

859
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,640
Cosine of pi over 12.

860
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,700
Point nine six five.

861
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,400
OK, so like I said, very close to one, and that's kind of what we would expect.

862
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,700
And the answer we just got was the square root of one plus the square root of three.

863
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,520
Got to make sure I do the divided by two correctly.

864
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,020
By two.

865
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:53,440
Right.

866
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,240
That looks correct.

867
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,460
But then all of that was divided by two.

868
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,400
All that stuff on the inside was divided by two.

869
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,220
And indeed, they're the same value.

870
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,580
So even just something like pi 12, we end up getting a very convoluted image.

871
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,391
Now, like I said, this is a reflection of the fact that our cosine identity that we found 

872
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:15,880
at the very beginning, just by playing through with graphs, it's definitely not obvious.

873
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,565
And what we'll find next time is that this is actually a shadow of 

874
00:56:19,565 --> 00:56:23,360
the fact that trigonometric functions are related to complex numbers.

875
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,996
And the idea of doubling the angle here corresponding to multiplying by something twice, 

876
00:56:27,996 --> 00:56:29,260
not at all a coincidence.

877
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,840
I think it's very fun.

878
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,660
I'm excited to show you guys all about that.

879
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,010
Now, what I wanted to do just to finish things off here, though, 

880
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,280
was to show two things that are not commonly shown about the unit circle.

881
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,640
OK, so we see where sine and cosine are, but there might be a couple of questions.

882
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,220
Where is tan?

883
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,600
OK, where in our picture do we see tangent of theta?

884
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:56,499
And then also, where is cosine of x or cosine of theta 

885
00:56:56,499 --> 00:57:02,400
squared or with the dumb convention, cosine squared of theta?

886
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,980
So pulling up another one of my infinite supply of unit circles here.

887
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,040
Actually, you know what?

888
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,513
This one's not going to have enough y axis, so I'm going to do something 

889
00:57:14,513 --> 00:57:18,380
that I really shouldn't do, which is to try to use a compass live on camera.

890
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,880
I'm sort of terrible at using compasses because it always slips out for me.

891
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,340
We're just going to do this.

892
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,120
I'm so nervous that this is going to somehow slip out.

893
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,860
Oh, yeah, that actually didn't turn out too badly.

894
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,560
Hopefully the pencil shows up OK on screen.

895
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,629
The reason I'm doing this is the tangent is going to demand that we think outside of 

896
00:57:37,629 --> 00:57:42,640
the box, that we think outside of the circle in order to geometrically interpret it.

897
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,030
You could just ask about the opposite divided by the adjacent, 

898
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,880
which is where that SOHCAHTOA TOA comes from.

899
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,768
But what I really want is a single length in our diagram that corresponds to 

900
00:57:55,768 --> 00:58:00,100
the tangent so we can kind of get that nice geometric intuitive feel for it.

901
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,204
And the idea is we take that radius, which is one, 

902
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:08,415
and if we think of the fact that tangent of theta, SOHCAHTOA, 

903
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:11,811
is supposed to be the opposite over the adjacent, 

904
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:15,480
I want a triangle where that adjacent is equal to one.

905
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,860
OK, so a right triangle such that this one is the adjacent side to our angle theta.

906
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,945
Well, in order to do that, let's just draw a right 

907
00:58:25,945 --> 00:58:29,140
angled perpendicular line off of our radial line.

908
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,892
And some of you might know that if you draw a perpendicular line 

909
00:58:33,892 --> 00:58:37,580
to the radius of a circle, it actually lies tangent to the circle.

910
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,340
So you see tangent, this is where the word comes from.

911
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,349
Then what we have is a triangle where the adjacent side to 

912
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:49,020
theta is one and then the opposite side is this length here.

913
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:53,520
So that length there is the tangent of theta.

914
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,995
And so right now you can kind of intuitively understand that as theta is very small, 

915
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:02,072
when the opposite over adjacent is very close to zero, 

916
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:06,100
because that opposite is close to zero and the adjacent is close to one.

917
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,160
Well, indeed, this length also is getting very close to zero.

918
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,740
And then you can also think through what happens as that angle approaches 90 degrees.

919
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:19,791
This is something I actually illustrated once before in a previous video, 

920
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:23,180
a lesser known video entitled Tattoos on Math.

921
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,740
That, fun fact, includes someone who is behind the scenes as we say all of this right now.

922
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,840
But the idea is that when you draw that tangent line, 

923
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,180
tangent is this length that I just pointed out to you.

924
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,660
And in that context, you could also think about cotangent.

925
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,687
There's this whole other triad of trigonometric functions that aren't worth teaching, 

926
00:59:42,687 --> 00:59:44,280
but are kind of historical quirks.

927
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,360
That's actually what that whole video was about.

928
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,415
But from here, you can just play around with moving the angle theta 

929
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:53,820
and seeing what that does to this tangent value, to that tangent length.

930
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,908
And using that intuition, actually, I want you to place a guess 

931
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:02,460
on what the graph of tangent of theta is going to look like.

932
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,260
So once again, let's go over to our live question dynamic.

933
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,060
Again, congratulations to those of you who got the last one right.

934
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,979
And as our final question before the end of this particular stream, 

935
01:00:12,979 --> 01:00:17,274
which is a rather tall question, so it might actually pop up over, 

936
01:00:17,274 --> 01:00:20,160
over below the values we have available here.

937
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,328
The final question, I just want you to guess what 

938
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,160
the tangent of theta looks like when we graph it.

939
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,900
And it should be pulled up now.

940
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,700
And oh, there we go.

941
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,160
It is rather tall, though.

942
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:34,780
OK.

943
01:00:35,919 --> 01:00:38,070
So let me go ahead and pull up a separate image 

944
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,400
for you here so that you can see all of the options.

945
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,080
Let's pop over here and take a look.

946
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:44,500
Great.

947
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:49,986
So again, if you go to 3b1b.co slash live, where the link is in the description, 

948
01:00:49,986 --> 01:00:52,060
you can submit your answers to this.

949
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,500
Basically, which one of these graphs shows you the tangent of theta?

950
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:03,640
Unfortunately, we're going to have to kind of switch back and forth to see the statistics.

951
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,118
It looks like there's pretty strong consensus in one direction, 

952
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:11,254
but I'm going to give you I'm going to give you a little bit more time to think about 

953
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:12,120
it if you want to.

954
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,080
Don't feel rushed.

955
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,240
Don't feel like you have to jump right into it.

956
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,040
I want a little ambient pause and ponder music while we're at it.

957
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,720
I'm mildly addicted to it.

958
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,280
All right.

959
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,700
So while you're answering.

960
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,859
So as we can see, some people are clearly messing with the website and having fun, 

961
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:15,440
or there's a bug in the website to answer various other things.

962
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,540
Other fun thing going on.

963
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:24,500
It seems like we've got a couple comments in the in the Json associated with the answers.

964
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:30,541
So to the person who decided to skip over my very draconian limits on the live 

965
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:36,660
chat dynamic and instead entered in Json comment through the answer forum forum.

966
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,620
I really enjoyed this class.

967
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,520
Thank you.

968
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,500
I appreciate that.

969
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,160
And I appreciate your your hacky instincts.

970
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,820
You're going to go far in life, my friend.

971
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,400
You're going to go very, very far.

972
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,920
So let's go ahead and grade this question here.

973
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,300
It looks like we have very strong consensus, hopefully around the correct answer.

974
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:59,642
And the correct answer is a again, maybe a little bit hard 

975
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:03,440
to see on our on our indication of the question over here.

976
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,620
But a is the graph that looks like this.

977
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,720
And what you'll notice is it starts at zero.

978
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,320
And then as you approach pi halves, it blows up to infinity.

979
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:18,142
OK, now, in terms of the animations and the geometric interpretation of tangent, 

980
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:23,246
that should actually make sense, because if we go back to what we were 

981
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:27,560
looking at as the angle blows up, the angle doesn't blow up.

982
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,020
The angle does a very modest thing of simply going to pi halves a fine number.

983
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,360
But the tangent of that angle is going to just get bigger and bigger.

984
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,560
And ultimately, it's it's not defined.

985
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,680
It's the same as dividing by zero once you get to pi halves.

986
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,627
And then after that, if you play the same game, 

987
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:46,024
it's going to be it's going to be considered a negative value, 

988
01:03:46,024 --> 01:03:50,499
which basically comes down to the fact that the opposite and adjacent sides of our 

989
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:53,680
triangle are going to be considered to have separate signs.

990
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:00,061
So the very last thing that I want to talk about, like I said, 

991
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:04,540
is the question of where does cosine squared of theta show up in our image?

992
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,860
Because this is the very thing that we opened with is trying to understand cosine squared.

993
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,888
And you might think, oh, if we can see that in our image somewhere, 

994
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:15,400
maybe it really reveals why it looks like a miniature version of the cosine wave.

995
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:19,681
Now, one of the naive things, not naive, but one of the first things you might 

996
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:23,661
try to do is pull up the original cosine animation that we had or something like 

997
01:04:23,661 --> 01:04:27,740
it and say, oh, well, I'm going to take that cosine length and literally square it.

998
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,580
I'm just going to draw the square based on that.

999
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:34,267
And if I were to do this, where I'm going to plot the length of that horizontal line 

1000
01:04:34,267 --> 01:04:38,520
and I'm also going to plot the area of that square, it's a little bit complicated.

1001
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,224
It certainly shows us what we already saw before, 

1002
01:04:44,224 --> 01:04:48,460
which is that the square of that value looks like another cosine wave.

1003
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,533
But this is something where just by staring at the image, 

1004
01:04:52,533 --> 01:04:54,520
it actually doesn't yield much insight.

1005
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,733
I think oftentimes in geometry or math, when you simply 

1006
01:04:57,733 --> 01:05:00,800
write down the definition of things, the answer pops out.

1007
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,940
This is a sign that again, it's not trivial.

1008
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,910
It's very unclear why the way that that square, 

1009
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:10,243
that literal square would oscillate is going to be related to cosine, 

1010
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:12,100
much less cosine of two theta.

1011
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,820
So it's going to come from somewhere else inside our image.

1012
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,740
And for that, let me go ahead and draw a much bigger triangle for ourselves.

1013
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,420
Let's say we've got one of these guys that was living inside the unit circle.

1014
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,760
This, by the way, I think is the most exciting part of the lecture.

1015
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,311
So if there was just one thing that you were going to stick around for, 

1016
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:40,020
I would say that this is the thing that you should.

1017
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,600
Because it gives a very sneaky proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

1018
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,260
It might feel like a circular argument at first, but I assure you that it's not.

1019
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,580
And I also assure you that the word circular was not meant as a pun there.

1020
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,722
So remember, if that's our angle theta, then one of our side 

1021
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:58,100
lengths is sine of theta and the other one is cosine of theta.

1022
01:05:59,879 --> 01:06:03,430
Let me ask you, if I draw, well, okay, so, you know, 

1023
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:07,583
the example we had earlier was this leaning tower thing where 

1024
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:12,540
we kind of imagined casting a shadow from a leaning tower onto the ground.

1025
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,333
This is sort of going to flip it on its head and say, well, 

1026
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:18,700
this angle theta between them, who's to say who's the tower and who's the ground?

1027
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,475
What if I wanted to have a light source over here and 

1028
01:06:21,475 --> 01:06:24,320
I wanted to cast a shadow from the ground onto the tower?

1029
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,320
A nice perpendicular line in this direction.

1030
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,360
That way my angle theta is going to do double duty for me.

1031
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,676
It's describing the angle between these two lines, 

1032
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:39,120
but in one context, this ground line was the adjacent side.

1033
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
It was the short side.

1034
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,260
But now, if I ask you a question like, what is this side length?

1035
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,165
The shadow that the ground lays down on the tower, 

1036
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:53,180
if that's not more confusing than I want it to be, what are we going to get?

1037
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,017
Well, in terms of this smaller right triangle that we've just created, 

1038
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:04,789
by definition, the cosine of that angle is going to be the adjacent side, 

1039
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:08,980
the thing we want to know, maybe I'll call it s for shadow again.

1040
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,300
I'm going to write down what it equals.

1041
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,100
It's going to be the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.

1042
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,760
But for this little triangle, the hypotenuse is cosine.

1043
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:24,126
So it's divided by the cosine of theta, which means cosine squared of theta, 

1044
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:27,820
dumb convention, is equal to the answer that we want.

1045
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,260
Let me just write it down in a different color to really emphasize.

1046
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,980
Cosine squared of theta.

1047
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,860
And let me emphasize, this is not using the Pythagorean theorem in any way.

1048
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,123
This is not having the cosine squared arrive because we were assuming 

1049
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:46,320
that this sits on a circle where x squared plus y squared equals one.

1050
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,730
We're just using the definition of cosine twice 

1051
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,940
to cast one shadow and then to cast another.

1052
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,840
Now, you can probably see where this is going, do the same thing for the sine of theta.

1053
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,840
So another place where theta shows up in our diagram is right here.

1054
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,760
And a way that you can see that is that this angle plus something must equal 90 degrees.

1055
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,520
But this other something plus r theta had to be the 

1056
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,760
remaining angles of the little right triangle that we had.

1057
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,560
Or you might think up here, I could just give it a different name.

1058
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,027
If I called this other angle alpha, then we know that alpha plus theta, 

1059
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:26,672
alpha plus theta plus 90 degrees, or pi halves, 

1060
01:08:26,672 --> 01:08:31,760
if you want to get used to the better conventions, has to equal pi.

1061
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,660
It's got to equal 180 degrees.

1062
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:36,359
This is maybe confusing.

1063
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,399
Just think alpha plus theta plus pi halves.

1064
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,761
In the back of your mind, you can go to 90 degrees 

1065
01:08:41,761 --> 01:08:43,580
if that's something you want for comfort.

1066
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,525
But that also implies that when we have a new right triangle sitting here, 

1067
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:52,751
this little angle here has got to be theta because it's alpha plus 90 plus something, 

1068
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:54,520
so that something's got to be theta.

1069
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,533
Now, the reason I have stated that so much is because we're going to 

1070
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:02,040
play our same shadow casting game to figure out what this side length is.

1071
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,935
Now, with respect to that, we have sine of theta of this theta 

1072
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:11,675
in particular is the opposite, the new shadow we don't know, 

1073
01:09:11,675 --> 01:09:16,960
I'll call it s prime, is equal to s prime divided by the hypotenuse.

1074
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,545
Well, on this smaller right triangle, what was the long side has become the hypotenuse, 

1075
01:09:22,545 --> 01:09:23,960
so that's sine of theta.

1076
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,920
Sine of theta.

1077
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,660
Which means sine squared of theta is our other shadow.

1078
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,620
This here is sine squared of theta.

1079
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,000
So that's kind of cool.

1080
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:41,517
The side length, which was by definition one, because we've always been 

1081
01:09:41,517 --> 01:09:44,793
rescaling our triangles such that the hypotenuse is one, 

1082
01:09:44,793 --> 01:09:48,930
can be broken down into one part that's cosine squared and another part 

1083
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,080
that's sine squared.

1084
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,327
And the way to break that down is to just draw a single line, 

1085
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:59,260
the perpendicular projection from our corner point onto that hypotenuse.

1086
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:05,037
So what that means is every time you see a unit circle out in the wild, 

1087
01:10:05,037 --> 01:10:10,180
which I'm sure you do pretty regularly, and you draw the standard triangle 

1088
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:14,774
to understand sine and cosine, so that height is going to be sine, 

1089
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:19,780
the x coordinate is going to be cosine, and our hypotenuse is always one.

1090
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,740
So that hypotenuse is one, this is theta.

1091
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,300
And you ask yourself, where is cosine squared in this diagram?

1092
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,520
Where is sine squared?

1093
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,701
You can just draw a little perpendicular line here, 

1094
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:40,220
and the part on the bottom is cosine squared.

1095
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,160
So, cos squared of theta is this length, this length here.

1096
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,168
And what we'll do in a future lecture, actually, 

1097
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:54,581
I want to talk about geometry and geometry proofs, and in particular, 

1098
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:57,799
one that comes up all the time, I've used it in many past videos, 

1099
01:10:57,799 --> 01:11:00,968
it's high time we just sit down and say, how would you prove it, 

1100
01:11:00,968 --> 01:11:02,480
is the inscribed angle theorem.

1101
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:06,800
So, after showing you how complex numbers play into things next time, 

1102
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,967
I want to turn back to this particular diagram to give another very intuitive 

1103
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:15,402
understanding for the identity that you found simply by playing around with graphs 

1104
01:11:15,402 --> 01:11:19,356
at the very beginning here, which, again, is a very non-trivial identity, 

1105
01:11:19,356 --> 01:11:23,577
that the cosine squared of some value is one plus the cosine of two times that 

1106
01:11:23,577 --> 01:11:24,700
value divided by two.

1107
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:30,399
The more standard way you see it, by the way, if you were to look this up in a textbook, 

1108
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:34,451
instead of writing this as x, this is commonly written as something like 

1109
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:37,560
alpha halves for some angle, and then 2x would be alpha.

1110
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:45,072
And the whole thing ends up looking like cosine of alpha divided by two 

1111
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:52,480
is equal to the square root of one plus cosine of alpha divided by two.

1112
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,917
I, for one, I have such trouble memorizing the trig identities, 

1113
01:11:56,917 --> 01:11:59,580
and I always would just sort of re-derive them on the fly.

1114
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:03,126
And this is one where I think the easiest way to re-derive is to practice 

1115
01:12:03,126 --> 01:12:07,008
kind of smooshing around graphs in your head, when you have the one key insight, 

1116
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:09,980
which is that squaring cosine gets you a smaller cosine graph.

1117
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,906
And the next time I'll show you how complex numbers help 

1118
01:12:12,906 --> 01:12:15,440
you kind of re-derive a bunch of other identities on the fly.

1119
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,160
But this one in particular, I just always had trouble remembering.

1120
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,940
It's called the half-angle identity.

1121
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:24,174
And I just think it's delightful that before you even know any trigonometry, 

1122
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:28,410
simply hopping over to something like Desmos and being a little bit playful, 

1123
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,600
that, I mean, that lands you on a highly non-trivial fact.

1124
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,620
And once again, it's one that indicates that cosine is related to exponentials.

1125
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,240
That's not obvious, and hopefully next time we can start to get a glimpse of why.

1126
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,180
Thanks for sticking around this long.

1127
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,441
Thank you once again to Cam and Ben Eater, who have been making 

1128
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:49,780
the item pool magic behind the scenes to get us our live statistics.

1129
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,980
And I'll see you go at the very end.

1130
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,960
I had almost everything down until the very end.

1131
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,840
I will see you all on Friday.
