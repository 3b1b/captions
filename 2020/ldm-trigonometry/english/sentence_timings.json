  495.94

  500.76

  502.3,
  504.76

  513.24

  513.24,
  515.02

  "But it still cycles once every 2 pi, right?",

  "You have to go from 0 all the way up to 2 pi before this blue graph that we're looking at goes through the cycle from 1 down to 0 now, back up to 1.",
  525.62,
  535.84

 [
  "So the last step is going to be to squish it in the x direction.",
  536.42,
  539.52

  "And sometimes people find this very counterintuitive that you scale up that input, that you multiply it by 2 in order to squish it.",
  540.44,
  547.86
 ],
 [
  "But what's really going on, if you think it through, is we want to say instead of taking 2 pi to go through your full cycle, I want you to go through that cycle as x ranges from 0 to pi.",
  547.94,
  557.76
 ],
 [
  "So if we make that input 2x, then the thing being plugged into cosine will go from 0 to 2 pi as x goes from 0 up to pi.",
  558.14,
  565.18

 [
  "And what you'll look at is the graphs are right on top of each other, right?",
  565.62,
  568.8

 [
  "Which is very cool, right on top of each other, and that means you've discovered a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometry.",
  569.0,
  574.6

 [
  "And it's worth writing down because it's one of those things that comes up later in a very hard to memorize way.",

  581.1
 ],
 [
  "I always had a little bit of trouble actually remembering what this thing is.",
  581.1,
  584.32
 ],
 [
  "So, writing down what you just found, cosine of x squared, okay, is equal to 1 plus cosine of 2x, which is basically saying increase its frequency.",
  584.9,
  602.42

 [
  "So we're going to double its frequency and then add 1 to it.",
  602.42,
  605.04

 [
  "So it's going to shift above that y-axis, and then we're going to divide that by 2, okay?",
  605.04,
  610.5
 ],
 [
  "So this is a fact that we're going to turn back to at the very end of the lecture, and as you start to get an appreciation for what the cosine means, it becomes clearer and clearer just how non-obvious this is.",
  610.5,
  621.58

  633.5

  946.86,
  950.04

  "So if we think through what this might mean in the context of our graphs here, the cosine, which remember is measuring the x-coordinate of your little dot as you walk around the circle.",

  1140.92,
  1143.32

 [
  "This is really the way to think about pi is you've got a unit circle, it takes you halfway around.",

  1153.06,
  1156.66

  1163.76

  1168.9

  1183.04

  1183.04,
  1186.14

 [
  "When you walk almost halfway around, which is to say almost pi radians, well, there's still a little bit of height left.",
  1186.32,
  1195.26
 ],
 [
  "And importantly, it's positive because you're still above that x-axis.",
  1195.56,
  1198.3

 [
  "So when we turn back to our question, the only thing differentiating our answers was that some of them would switch whether sine or cosine was the one that's close to negative 1.",
  1199.1,
  1208.32

  "So then SOH CAH TOA, if that's a phrase that you remember running through your head, tells you that the sine of this angle, this is the definition of sine for some kind of angle that we input, is for such a right triangle, it's the opposite over the hypotenuse.",
  1280.62,

 ],
 [
  "That's not necessarily how far its new top is off of the ground.",
  1522.16,

  "That's what gives us our nice right triangle.",

  1542.52,
  1549.9

  "I'll just call it x, or maybe I'll call it s for shadow, try to give our variables readable meanings, divided by the hypotenuse, which is 100.",

 [
  "When we think about like sound with decibels, which scales a whole bunch and it's got this crazy exponential pattern to it, we logarithmically change it and we have this very awkward system that's really twisting the math behind its back, so that we can think of whole numbers between 0 and 100.",

  1660.78,
  1670.62
 ],
 [
  "So we might as well say, okay, let's scale this so that the hypotenuse is 1, meaning we divide everything by h, and what that's going to get us is the opposite side is now O over h, whatever that was, and then the adjacent side is A over h, meaning that the vertical component here is sine of theta, where theta was our angle down here, and then that bottom part is cosine of theta.",
  1670.62,
  1701.4
 ],
 [
  "And if we want to think about all possible right triangles who have a hypotenuse of 1, what you might think of is taking a unit circle, because that's saying every point is a distance of 1 away, so think of that line as the hypotenuse of a triangle.",

  1772.1

  "So that one will be pi sixths.",
  1974.12,
  1976.22
 ],

  "So one thing I might ask you now is if you can leverage the symmetry of the setup, the fact that equilateral triangles are going to be very nice and that the right triangle coming about from it is very nice, to answer something like a very concrete calculation, what is the sine of pi sixths?",

  "Okay, so why is that the case?",
  2114.92,
  2116.18

  2116.38,
  2118.14
 ],
 [
  "Well, remember, sine of pi six, we're asking SOHCAHTOA.",
  2118.78,

 [
  "With respect to this smaller angle, the opposite side is this segment here.",
  2135.48,

 ],
 [
  "And because of the symmetry of our triangle, that's going to be one half.",
  2142.0,
  2144.86
 ],
 [
  "Because each side length of the equilateral triangle is one, so half of it should be one half.",

 ],
 [
  "And divided by the hypotenuse, but by definition the hypotenuse was one here.",
  2150.68,
  2154.82
 ],
 [
  "So one half divided by one, it's just the same as one half.",
  2154.84,
  2157.6

  "There we go.",
  2178.2,
  2179.02

  "If you can, I would highly encourage you to be keeping your own notes, right?",

  "So let's go ahead and grade the answers.",
  2240.16,

  "Now, how do you figure something like that out?",
  2254.48,
  2256.84
 ],
 [
  "Well, the trick is basically if you have one of these right triangles, if you know one of their sides, then you know both of them.",
  2257.94,
  2263.84
 ],
 [
  "So let me draw a little copy for ourselves here.",
  2263.92,
  2266.06
 ],
 [
  "We know that the hypotenuse is one, one of the side lengths is one half, and the only thing that's missing if we're thinking the cosine of 30 degrees is this adjacent side.",
  2267.68,
  2277.24
 ],
 [
  "So because we were doing it with the angle up there, adjacent side is here.",
  2277.24,
  2280.84
 ],
 [
  "Now the Pythagorean theorem tells us that that adjacent value squared plus the other leg length squared is going to equal one squared.",
  2281.32,
  2291.58
 ],
 [
  "A hypotenuse squared, which means that value is equal to the square root of one minus, well what's one half squared?",
  2292.74,
  2302.14
 ],
 [
  "It's one fourth.",
  2302.34,
  2303.0
 ],
 [
  "Which means it is the square root of one minus a fourth is three fourths.",
  2304.12,
  2309.74
 ],
 [
  "So we can go ahead and take the square root of that bottom and just leave the radical in the top.",
  2310.42,
  2314.2
 ],
 [
  "And what we get is the square root of three all divided by two.",
  2314.82,
  2317.76
 ],
 [
  "Now this is a value that anybody coming out of a trig class becomes very familiar with.",
  2317.76,
  2322.86
 ],
 [
  "They're like, okay, if the answer isn't one half, it's going to be square root of three over two.",
  2322.96,
  2326.36
 ],
 [
  "Or root two over two also comes up in another circumstance.",
  2326.98,
  2329.92
 ],
 [
  "But this is one of those that kind of becomes burned in your memory.",
  2330.34,
  2332.9
 ],
 [
  "Square root of three divided by two.",
  2333.26,
  2334.4
 ],
 [
  "And one very important fact that's come about here that's worth highlighting is that, hmm, how does the Pythagorean theorem play into our trigonometry?",
  2335.3,
  2346.98
 ],
 [
  "Because if we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is one, and we know that one of the side lengths, let me switch to thinking with respect to this lower left angle again.",
  2347.54,
  2356.1
 ],
 [
  "If one of the side lengths is cosine of theta, and one of them is sine of theta, well the Pythagorean theorem tells us that cosine of x squared plus sine of x squared is always equal to one squared.",
  2356.38,
  2376.9
 ],
 [
  "Okay?",
  2377.4,
  2377.8
 ],
 [
  "Now this is a very important identity.",
  2378.82,
  2380.4
 ],
 [
  "It basically tells you if you know cosine, you know sine.",
  2380.56,
  2383.24
 ],
 [
  "If you know sine, you know cosine.",
  2383.42,
  2385.08
 ],
 [
  "And it also is giving you a little reminder that it's all really about the Pythagorean theorem.",
  2385.28,
  2389.08
 ],
 [
  "In fact, this is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem.",
  2389.66,
  2392.08
 ],
 [
  "Because if you think of how cosine and sine are defined, it's just defined in terms of the leg lengths of a right triangle, and then everything scaled down as needed.",
  2392.32,
  2400.1
 ],
 [
  "Now there's one very silly convention with how we write these things.",
  2400.1,
  2404.06
 ],
 [
  "So we've already started to make friends with the cosine of x squared function, and the fact that it's a little more interesting than you might think at first sight.",
  2404.12,
  2410.46
 ],
 [
  "But you never see it written down as open parenthesis cosine of x closed parenthesis squared.",
  2411.16,
  2416.52
 ],
 [
  "Because people don't want to write too many parenthesis, instead they write cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x.",
  2417.02,
  2427.28
 ],
 [
  "It's all very nice.",
  2428.02,
  2429.22

 [
  "How lovely.",
  2430.4,
  2431.18

 [
  "What a wonderful convention.",
  2433.08,
  2434.18
 ],
 [
  "Except for the fact that literally every other time in math you see something written as f squared of x, what that means is not f of x squared.",
  2434.78,
  2445.5
 ],
 [
  "That's almost never what it means.",
  2445.66,
  2447.3
 ],
 [
  "Instead, what it's supposed to mean for most of math is taking a function and applying it to itself, like layering it over itself.",
  2447.3,
  2457.24
 ],
 [
  "That's what that 2 usually refers to.",
  2457.38,
  2459.1
 ],
 [
  "Sometimes later on it refers to the second derivative, especially if it has some parenthesis around it.",
  2459.38,
  2464.64
 ],
 [
  "But the idea is that it's very different from the convention in trigonometry.",
  2464.88,
  2468.64
 ],
 [
  "Trigonometry is just flying by its own rules and saying, yeah, yeah, we've got our own conventions for what it means when you put a little 2 up there.",

 [
  "You get used to it.",
  2482.7,

  2496.68

  "Now, very interesting is that this is not just a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem that gives us a relation between our trig functions.",
  2497.78,
  2506.2

  "At the end of the lecture, I want to show you how you can use trig functions to prove the Pythagorean theorem in a sneaky way.",

  "And it's pretty sneaky.",
  2513.18,
  2513.9

  2520.28
 ],
 [
  "But it is very visually satisfying.",

 [
  "But let's try a question that's a little bit different from that.",
  2548.74,
  2551.9

 [
  "And what if I instead said cosine of negative two pi over three?",
  2553.34,
  2560.88

  "OK, now that's one that is hard to think of in terms of triangles, because what does it mean to have a negative angle?",
  2562.48,
  2568.9

  "So this is a good reminder that cosine and sine, even if you think they're about triangles, are really about circles.",
  2569.44,
  2575.64

 [
  "And remember, if you walk all the way around the circle, and if it has a radius of one, walking all the way around the circle is going to take you a distance of two pi.",
  2576.14,
  2584.12
 ],
 [
  "So if you want to think about two pi thirds, what you might start by doing is chopping the triangle into thirds and then using that to help guide the intuitions.",
  2585.0,

  "But again, I kind of want to do this as a live quiz.",
  2595.12,

  "You reference your notes now.",
  2619.54,
  2620.92

 [
  "It looks like one of you figured out how to submit an answer that is not one of the four multiple choices.",
  2639.72,

  2668.92

  2711.64,
  2714.62
 ],
 [
  "OK.",
  2715.26,
  2715.32
 ],
 [
  "And it looks like the second most common answer was D, which is negative root three over two.",
  2715.64,
  2720.64
 ],
 [
  "OK, so that's very good because often it's kind of this back and forth between whether you think it's a half or whether you think it's root three over two, because it's sort of the difference between things that feel like 30 degree angles and things that feel like 60 degree angles.",
  2721.08,
  2736.5
 ],
 [
  "So let's take a look back at our drawing and see how we might think about this.",
  2736.5,
  2740.28
 ],
 [
  "So, like I said, negative two pi divided by three.",
  2741.4,
  2744.08
 ],
 [
  "That's taking us a negative distance over here.",
  2744.16,
  2747.52
 ],
 [
  "And this is why cosine will be a negative number, because the x coordinate is pointing in the negative direction.",
  2747.7,
  2754.38
 ],
 [
  "And if you want to think of this in terms of triangles, I might draw this triangle here and ask, what is this angle?",
  2756.2,
  2762.68
 ],
 [
  "OK, we know that it's 90 degrees plus something or pi halves plus something and negative two pi over thirds.",
  2762.68,
  2770.96
 ],
 [
  "If we wanted to think in terms of degrees, if that's something we're more comfortable with, that's negative 360 divided by three degrees, which is negative 120 degrees.",
  2771.16,
  2783.08
 ],
 [
  "So if it takes 120 degrees to get around here, then that minus the 90 degree angle between the x and y axis gives us 30 degrees.",
  2783.78,
  2792.46
 ],
 [
  "OK, so then the question is, what is the cosine of this value?",
  2793.72,
  2797.56
 ],
 [
  "What is the x coordinate there?",
  2797.62,
  2798.82
 ],
 [
  "With your 30, 60, 90 triangles, it's just kind of a nice thing to remember that the shorter side is one half and the longer side is root three over two.",
  2799.52,
  2808.72
 ],
 [
  "And if you forget why, it's exactly the diagram that we just drew before associated with equilateral triangles.",
  2808.72,
  2816.22
 ],
 [
  "Because if you imagine taking the equilateral triangle and chopping it in half, then the shorter side has length one half and then the longer side comes from the Pythagorean theorem.",
  2817.18,
  2825.76
 ],
 [
  "So congratulations to those of you who correctly found that.",
  2828.5,
  2831.34
 ],
 [
  "Now, I want to bring back that identity that you guys found at the very beginning, associated with cosine squared and cosine of two thetas, and show how that extends our capability for making some of these computations and figuring out certain values.",
  2832.16,
  2845.48
 ],
 [
  "So let's remind ourselves what that actually was.",
  2846.04,
  2847.86
 ],
 [
  "I'm going to go back here and I'm going to pull up again the Desmos graph.",
  2848.32,
  2851.8
 ],
 [
  "And remember how what we said is that cosine squared, which looks like this little scaled down version of cosine, oscillating more quickly, is the same as cosine of two x, that quicker oscillation.",
  2852.8,
  2865.82
 ],
 [
  "But we had to kind of shift it and rescale it to make them equal.",
  2865.82,
  2868.54
 ],
 [
  "So now we're going to use that fact that you can discover just by playing around with graphs to make a computation that otherwise would be pretty tricky to make.",
  2869.34,
  2877.18
 ],
 [
  "And I think that when you're able to make concrete computations, it's often a reflection of the fact that you have a deeper conceptual understanding of what's going on.",
  2877.18,
  2884.84
 ],
 [
  "So even if it's always going to be your calculator computing this, you're not sitting here working out cosine values by hand, the fact that you can is an illustrate that you understand that cosine function a little bit better.",
  2884.84,
  2895.04
 ],
 [
  "So over on our paper, let me write down again what that identity was.",
  2895.72,
  2899.2
 ],
 [
  "Let's go back to black.",
  2900.02,
  2901.12
 ],
 [
  "Good old friendly black.",
  2901.6,
  2902.68
 ],
 [
  "Cosine squared of x, using the dumb dumb convention, is one plus cosine of two x.",
  2904.06,
  2913.1
 ],
 [
  "So it's kind of oscillating more quickly, all divided by two.",
  2913.76,
  2917.48
 ],
 [
  "OK, so now I'm going to ask you a trickier question, which is going to be what is the cosine of pi twelfths?",
  2918.82,
  2928.68
 ],
 [
  "And for those of you keeping track, pi twelfths is the same as 15 degrees.",
  2930.26,
  2935.5
 ],
 [
  "So if we were doing this with a unit circle, what you might think is, OK, a 30 degree angle.",
  2936.4,
  2942.44
 ],
 [
  "It's looking like this.",
  2944.22,
  2945.7
 ],
 [
  "That's 30 degrees.",
  2947.3,
  2948.26
 ],
 [
  "I'm now going to be taking half of that.",
  2948.84,
  2951.14
 ],
 [
  "Half of that.",
  2952.58,
  2953.34
 ],
 [
  "And I want to know the cosine of this value, which is going to be the x coordinate of that value.",
  2953.84,
  2958.22
 ],
 [
  "And right away, you can probably make a guess that it's very close to one, right, because it's a small angle.",
  2958.22,
  2963.44
 ],
 [
  "And the small angle means that we haven't walked that far around a circle, so we haven't gotten that far away from one, especially given the fact that as you start to walk, almost all of your velocity is in the up and down direction.",
  2965.16,
  2976.12
 ],
 [
  "All right, so cosine of pi twelfths, 15 degrees.",
  2977.0,
  2979.08
 ],
 [
  "You know what's about to happen.",
  2979.34,
  2980.46

  2984.86
 ],
 [
  "All right.",
  2990.98,
  2991.88

  "It affects the overall distribution.",
  3012.98,
  3014.86

 [
  "This one, unlike what we had before, much less overall consensus.",
  3014.86,
  3019.76

 [
  "And it definitely seems to be taking a bit more time.",
  3020.54,
  3022.7

 [
  "Awesome.",
  3130.08,
  3130.5

  3131.0,
  3135.14

  "Who got that correct?",
  3154.58,
  3155.22

  3160.06
 ],
 [
  "There's just a minus sign in there.",
  3160.58,

  3181.74
 ],
 [
  "All right.",
  3182.38,
  3182.8
 ],
 [
  "So clearly this is a complicated answer, but where does it come from?",
  3183.24,
  3187.26
 ],
 [
  "Well, if we look at our identity here, the key is that it's relating two times an angle to the angle itself.",
  3188.78,
  3195.5
 ],
 [
  "So if we just plug this in for 15 degrees or for pi twelfth, what we would get is that the cosine squared of pi twelfth.",
  3195.5,
  3204.46
 ],
 [
  "OK, if we enter that as X is equal to one plus the cosine of two times that value, which is pi six.",
  3206.54,
  3216.52
 ],
 [
  "Pi six.",
  3217.78,
  3218.9
 ],
 [
  "All divided by two.",
  3220.16,
  3221.44
 ],
 [
  "Now, the cosine of pi six.",
  3221.86,
  3223.04
 ],
 [
  "We know.",
  3223.32,
  3223.82
 ],
 [
  "That's the same as our 30 degree angle here.",
  3225.02,
  3227.7
 ],
 [
  "Again, when you have a 30, 60, 90 triangle, the shorter side of that, which is going to be the sign in this context, the shorter side is one half.",
  3228.46,
  3237.78
 ],
 [
  "And then the longer side is square root of three over two, assuming that the hypotenuse is one, which in the context of the unit circle, we always do assume.",
  3239.2,
  3247.82
 ],
 [
  "So that means that we now have one plus the square root of three over two.",
  3247.82,
  3253.14
 ],
 [
  "That's what the cosine of pi six was all divided by two, which means our final answer.",
  3253.52,
  3258.52
 ],
 [
  "When we just want to say cosine of pi twelfth, no squared about it is going to be the square root of this value.",
  3259.92,
  3267.6
 ],
 [
  "OK, very interesting.",
  3268.56,
  3269.82
 ],
 [
  "So this is showing us that cosine and sine can get complicated.",
  3269.96,
  3274.0
 ],
 [
  "We've got a handful of values like pi six and pi thirds where we can figure them out.",
  3274.0,
  3278.94
 ],
 [
  "We can have even more, I won't call them trivial values, but easier to compute values like cosine of pi, where you would look at your unit circle and say, oh, pi.",
  3278.98,
  3287.6
 ],
 [
  "That means I've walked halfway around.",
  3287.82,
  3289.28
 ],
 [
  "So my x coordinate is negative one.",
  3289.4,
  3291.94
 ],
 [
  "But outside of just a handful of values like that, they're very hard to compute by hand.",
  3292.74,
  3297.7
 ],
 [
  "And in the olden days, the only way that people could compute them by hand for something like the existence of calculus would be measuring it.",
  3297.7,
  3305.16
 ],
 [
  "You like draw out with a protractor and you try to carefully see what the coordinates are or layering on usage of identities like this over and over in ways that you can get approximate values like this.",
  3305.3,
  3316.52
 ],
 [
  "And just to check ourselves, we can actually go and plug this into a calculator if we wanted to, something like Desmos and just see, one, how big the value is and kind of confirm for ourselves that they turn out to be the same.",
  3317.24,
  3328.56
 ],
 [
  "So if we pop over here and I just type something like.",
  3329.3,
  3332.52
 ],
 [
  "Cosine of pi over 12.",
  3334.02,
  3336.64
 ],
 [
  "Point nine six five.",
  3338.22,
  3339.7
 ],
 [
  "OK, so like I said, very close to one, and that's kind of what we would expect.",
  3340.36,
  3343.4
 ],
 [
  "And the answer we just got was the square root of one plus the square root of three.",
  3343.62,
  3347.7
 ],
 [
  "Got to make sure I do the divided by two correctly.",
  3348.56,
  3351.52
 ],
 [
  "By two.",
  3352.22,
  3353.02
 ],
 [
  "Right.",
  3353.34,
  3353.44
 ],
 [
  "That looks correct.",
  3353.5,
  3354.24

  "But then all of that was divided by two.",
  3355.54,
  3357.46

 [
  "All that stuff on the inside was divided by two.",
  3357.62,
  3359.4
 ],
 [
  "And indeed, they're the same value.",
  3359.9,
  3361.22
 ],
 [
  "So even just something like pi 12, we end up getting a very convoluted image.",
  3361.46,
  3365.58

 [
  "Now, like I said, this is a reflection of the fact that our cosine identity that we found at the very beginning, just by playing through with graphs, it's definitely not obvious.",
  3366.8,
  3375.88

  "And what we'll find next time is that this is actually a shadow of the fact that trigonometric functions are related to complex numbers.",
  3375.88,
  3383.36

 [
  "And the idea of doubling the angle here corresponding to multiplying by something twice, not at all a coincidence.",

  "I think it's very fun.",
  3389.78,

  3390.9,
  3392.66

  3480.74,
  3495.48

  "OK, so a right triangle such that this one is the adjacent side to our angle theta.",
  3495.94,
  3501.86

 [
  "Well, in order to do that, let's just draw a right angled perpendicular line off of our radial line.",
  3502.62,

  4013.18

  4028.98

  "I'm going to write down what it equals.",

 [
  "It's going to be the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.",
  4032.38,
  4035.1

 [
  "But for this little triangle, the hypotenuse is cosine.",
  4035.56,
  4038.76

  "Cosine squared of theta.",

  4059.86

  "This is not having the cosine squared arrive because we were assuming that this sits on a circle where x squared plus y squared equals one.",

 ],
 [
  "Now, you can probably see where this is going, do the same thing for the sine of theta.",

 [
  "So another place where theta shows up in our diagram is right here.",
  4076.42,
  4079.84
 ],

  "And a way that you can see that is that this angle plus something must equal 90 degrees.",
  4080.28,
  4085.76
 ],
 [
  "But this other something plus r theta had to be the remaining angles of the little right triangle that we had.",

 ],
 [
  "Or you might think up here, I could just give it a different name.",
  4094.76,
  4097.56
 ],
 [
  "If I called this other angle alpha, then we know that alpha plus theta, alpha plus theta plus 90 degrees, or pi halves, if you want to get used to the better conventions, has to equal pi.",

  "In the back of your mind, you can go to 90 degrees if that's something you want for comfort.",
  4119.5,
  4123.58
 ],
 [
  "But that also implies that when we have a new right triangle sitting here, this little angle here has got to be theta because it's alpha plus 90 plus something, so that something's got to be theta.",
  4124.84,
  4134.52
 ],
 [
  "Now, the reason I have stated that so much is because we're going to play our same shadow casting game to figure out what this side length is.",
  4135.22,
  4142.04
 ],
 [
  "Now, with respect to that, we have sine of theta of this theta in particular is the opposite, the new shadow we don't know, I'll call it s prime, is equal to s prime divided by the hypotenuse.",
  4142.04,
  4156.96
 ],
 [
  "Well, on this smaller right triangle, what was the long side has become the hypotenuse, so that's sine of theta.",
  4157.36,
  4163.96
 ],
 [
  "Sine of theta.",
  4164.84,
  4165.92
 ],
 [
  "Which means sine squared of theta is our other shadow.",
  4165.92,
  4171.66
 ],
 [
  "This here is sine squared of theta.",
  4172.42,
  4175.62
 ],
 [
  "So that's kind of cool.",
  4176.3,
  4177.0
 ],
 [
  "The side length, which was by definition one, because we've always been rescaling our triangles such that the hypotenuse is one, can be broken down into one part that's cosine squared and another part that's sine squared.",
  4177.38,
  4190.08
 ],
 [
  "And the way to break that down is to just draw a single line, the perpendicular projection from our corner point onto that hypotenuse.",
  4190.08,
  4199.26
 ],
 [
  "So what that means is every time you see a unit circle out in the wild, which I'm sure you do pretty regularly, and you draw the standard triangle to understand sine and cosine, so that height is going to be sine, the x coordinate is going to be cosine, and our hypotenuse is always one.",
  4200.1,
  4219.78
 ],
 [
  "So that hypotenuse is one, this is theta.",
  4221.32,

  4228.3
 ],
 [
  "Where is sine squared?",
  4228.54,
  4229.52

 [
  "You can just draw a little perpendicular line here, and the part on the bottom is cosine squared.",
  4230.48,

 [
  "So, cos squared of theta is this length, this length here.",
  4240.88,
  4247.16
 ],
 [
  "And what we'll do in a future lecture, actually, I want to talk about geometry and geometry proofs, and in particular, one that comes up all the time, I've used it in many past videos, it's high time we just sit down and say, how would you prove it, is the inscribed angle theorem.",
  4248.78,
  4262.48

 [
  "So, after showing you how complex numbers play into things next time, I want to turn back to this particular diagram to give another very intuitive understanding for the identity that you found simply by playing around with graphs at the very beginning here, which, again, is a very non-trivial identity, that the cosine squared of some value is one plus the cosine of two times that value divided by two.",
  4263.06,
  4284.7
 ],
 [
  "The more standard way you see it, by the way, if you were to look this up in a textbook, instead of writing this as x, this is commonly written as something like alpha halves for some angle, and then 2x would be alpha.",
  4285.46,
  4297.56

  4319.58
 ],
 [
  "And this is one where I think the easiest way to re-derive is to practice kind of smooshing around graphs in your head, when you have the one key insight, which is that squaring cosine gets you a smaller cosine graph.",

  4329.98

  4338.16

  "It's called the half-angle identity.",
  4338.52,
  4339.94
