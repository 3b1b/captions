1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
My end goal for this lecture and the following lecture is to draw for you a connection between trigonometry and complex numbers.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,120
And I really do think when you understand that connection between the two, it strengthens your understanding of both of them.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,480
So for this lecture, we're just going to go back to the basics on some of the trigonometric functions,

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,480
how to think about them, what they mean.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,500
And to dive into it, what I want to first do is imagine that you don't actually know any trigonometry yet,

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:32,140
but show how just playing around with a graphing calculator can lead you to come to some pretty non-trivial facts about trig.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,480
So for example, let's say you've never heard of the cosine function.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,040
But then one day, you know, it comes up, you hear someone talking about physics,

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,060
and they mention a sinusoidal wave and the cosine function and things like that.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,180
So you go to a graphing calculator, something like Desmos, and you just poke it in and say, okay,

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,780
what does this thing look like? Now before seeing its definition, you can understand,

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,020
oh, yeah, I can see how this might be relevant to waves and wave type dynamics that people might want to study.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,640
It's got kind of a cycling phenomenon to it.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,740
So maybe anytime people are studying something associated with cycling,

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,840
you could play around with the graph and do all the things that you can with any normal function.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,980
If I tweak the input, it kind of squishes it, right?

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,020
So as I put a bigger constant in front of that input X, it squishes things, gives it a higher frequency.

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,840
Okay, that's all well and good. You could stretch it out in the Y direction by messing with the output.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,380
Now what I want to do though is point out something very interesting about the cosine graph that

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
is something you might want to take note of.

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,220
So what I'm going to do is square it, and I don't want to show you what it looks like yet.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,680
I want you to predict what it's going to look like when we take cosine of X squared, okay?

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,240
And in particular, I'm just going to have you focus in on the region from 0 up to 2 pi.

24
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,400
So again, if you're just playing around, what you would notice is cosine is clearly related to pi and

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,280
probably circles in some way. So it takes a dip down to pi,

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,940
down to negative 1 at pi, excuse me, and then it comes right back up to 1 at the input 2 pi.

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,880
So what I want you to do is predict what it looks like when we take cosine of X squared.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,760
And let's actually do this as one of our fun live question dynamics, okay?

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,220
So getting rid of our Randy, which was a very informative thing for me,

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,800
let's dump into our very first genuinely mathematical quiz question.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,060
What does it say here?

32
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,760
What will the graph of f of X equals cosine of X squared look like?

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,780
Okay, and it looks like A as an option has these sort of valleys where in all of these

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,060
it might be a little small to read, but the range is going from 0 to about 2 pi.

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,420
So in A it hits 1 and then it goes down and hits 1 again at the input pi and kind of goes down with these flat valleys.

36
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,980
B has a similar behavior for when it hits 1 and 0, but it's a little spikier.

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,140
So it's kind of bouncing right off that x-axis.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,420
C looks just like a sinusoidal wave.

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,780
It looks like the same kind of wave, but it's all positive and it goes from 1 down to 0,

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
then up to 1 in the span of pi.

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:10,720
And then D kind of gets scrunched together in the x-direction and starts going more rapidly as you move farther to the right.

42
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,380
Okay, so it looks like we've got a lot of answers coming in.

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:21,020
A fair bit of consensus towards the top, but it's not definitely not a unanimous decision on this one where people are going.

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,600
So it seems like there's one most popular answer and then two that kind of tie closely for

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,900
the silver and the bronze medals.

46
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,920
So I'm going to give you just a couple more seconds here if you want to change your mind or if you want to go

47
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,540
to 3b1b.co

48
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,340
slash live and answer this as we're going. The link is also in the description if you just want to clink it there.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,020
Clink. Click it there.

50
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,420
Alright, I think that's probably enough time. Let's go ahead and grade this.

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
What do you think it will be?

52
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,500
Alright, it looks like a majority of you went with C, which is the one that looks like a sinusoidal wave.

53
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,340
The second most common one was A, which has a similar shape, but it's kind of more flattened out on the bottom.

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,000
Third most common was B, and then the the last most common was D.

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,600
And I think that's pretty good instincts because A, B, and C, which were the top three choices there, if we go back and look

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
at our actual cosine graph itself,

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,160
what you'll notice is that at the input 0 it's 1, so when you square that 1 squared should stay 1.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Similarly, negative 1 when you square that, that should come up to 1 as well. And then

59
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,420
positive 1 at the end of its cycle, again that's 1. So the idea that no matter what you're going to get something that

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,120
dips down to 0, then up to 1, down to 0, and up to 1 should make sense.

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,080
But the specific shape is what we don't know. Turns out, as you just saw, the answer is C. So if we go over here and reveal,

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,440
it looks just like a little cosine wave.

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Which is weird, if you think about it, because what we're doing when we square something is

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,960
affecting the output. It's affecting stuff happening in the y-direction, right? But to get another cosine wave that's oscillating more quickly,

65
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,160
it's not at all clear that that's what would happen. And

66
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,280
using this, even before you know what the cosine of x means, if you're just playing around being kind of

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,480
childlike with your graphing calculator, you can discover a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometric functions.

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,280
And then as we start defining them and getting into them,

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,540
you will appreciate just how non-trivial it is, because it really is not obvious. So for this,

70
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,540
I want to take us to a second question.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay, and I look at this graph hard, okay,

72
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,320
remember that it looks like a scaled-down version of the cosine graph. And what I'm going to want you to do is

73
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,640
basically come up with an identity based on that, okay?

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
So question number two,

75
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,920
what does it say?

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,240
Working from the assumption that the graph of cosine of x squared looks like a scaled-down version of the graph of cosine of x,

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,100
which of the following equations is true?

78
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,040
Okay, now because this might take a little moment for you guys to work out, pencil and paper,

79
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,400
highly encourage you to actively work it out.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm just going to give you maybe 30 to 60 seconds to start penciling through,

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,840
noodling it out, and let's introduce a little bit of pause and ponder music, just to put us in the problem-solving mood, I think.

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,600
So which one of these reflects the fact the cosine of x squared is kind of a scaled version of itself?

83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
So,

84
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
so

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,240
it looks like we still have a fair bit of answers rolling in and I don't want you to feel rushed,

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,720
so I'm going to give you time to figure it out for yourself if you want to.

87
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,380
While you're answering this, it looks like we've got ourselves a question that's rolled in, okay? So Diego

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,080
Mathemagician, love the name, asks, what is the new music?

89
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Great question. So the guy who usually composes the music for the channel, his name is Vince, Vince Rubenetti.

90
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,440
I told him that we were doing these streams and I mentioned I wanted kind of a jeopardy.

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,000
Here, I'll turn it down so that I can talk over it. Vince, your music is great,

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
but I want to talk about it a little bit more.

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,560
I wanted just a jeopardy type theme, but mixed with the usual three blue and brown vibe,

94
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,980
so a little clock ticking, and I think it really puts you in the problem-solving mood.

95
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Now that is probably enough to noodle this one out, so I'm going to go ahead and grade this.

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
And I'm guessing the majority have gotten it correct. Okay, great job.

97
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,180
So to the 3,165 of you that answered B, which is that it's one half cosine of 2x plus 1,

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,640
congratulations, you're absolutely correct.

99
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,800
But let's think about how you might do that in a step-by-step way.

100
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,860
And this is one of those things that, again, if you're just noodling around on a graphing calculator, you can come to.

101
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,680
So what I might do is take, here, I'll just, I'll go ahead and write a new cosine function, okay?

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,800
And then I'm going to start manipulating it. So cosine of x, we won't look at the original.

103
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,600
The first thing you'd notice is, okay,

104
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,520
we want to make it entirely positive because that's what the other one is, so maybe I'm going to shift it up by one.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,760
Okay, and that makes it all positive.

106
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,600
But now it's twice as high as the other graph we're looking at, so if we want to make it equal,

107
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
we might chop it in half.

108
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,580
But it still cycles once every 2 pi, right?

109
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,660
You have to go from 0 all the way up to 2 pi before this blue graph that we're looking at

110
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,740
goes through the cycle from 1 down to 0 now, back up to 1.

111
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,220
So the last step is going to be to squish it in the x direction.

112
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,980
And sometimes people find this very

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,540
counterintuitive that you scale up that input, that you multiply it by 2 in order to squish it.

114
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,820
But what's really going on if you think it through is we want to say, instead of taking

115
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,660
2 pi to go through your full cycle, I want you to go through that cycle as x ranges from 0 to pi.

116
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,900
So if we make that input 2x,

117
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,380
then the thing being plugged into cosine will go from 0 to 2 pi as x goes from 0 up to pi.

118
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,700
And what you'll look at is the graphs are right on top of each other, right?

119
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,300
Which is very cool, right on top of each other, and that means you've discovered a pretty non-trivial fact about trigonometry.

120
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,020
And it's worth writing down because it's one of those things that comes up later in a very hard to memorize way.

121
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,700
I always had a little bit of trouble actually remembering what this thing is.

122
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:53,100
So, writing down what you just found, cosine of x squared,

123
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,740
okay, is equal to 1 plus cosine of 2x,

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,460
which is basically saying increase its frequency.

125
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,020
So we're going to double its frequency and then add 1 to it.

126
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,460
So it's going to shift above that y-axis, and then we're going to divide that by 2, okay?

127
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,980
So this is a fact that we're going to turn back to at the very end of the lecture,

128
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,860
and as you start to get an appreciation for what the cosine means,

129
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,620
it becomes clearer and clearer just how non-obvious this is.

130
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,420
And in particular, the one thing I want you to take note of is the weird fact that we've got this function that when you square it,

131
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,460
it's not equal to, but it's somewhat related to the idea of scaling up that input.

132
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,540
Now if you were clever,

133
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,060
there is another function that behaves very similarly to this,

134
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,260
where when you square it, it's the same as doing something to its input.

135
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,660
And this actually takes us to our next question.

136
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
So let's go ahead and move past from this one,

137
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,100
okay, and I'm going to ask you something that seems very unrelated to trigonometry,

138
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,980
and it'll take us until the next lecture to realize just how related it is.

139
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
What does our question say?

140
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,980
Okay, so when you plug in 2x, it should be the same as f of x squared.

141
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,340
Option A, square root of 1 minus x squared,

142
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
option B, log of x,

143
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
option C, x squared,

144
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,260
and option D, 2 to the x.

145
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,940
Okay, so I'm going to give you a couple minutes, a little bit to answer that.

146
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
We won't take too long on this one.

147
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,060
Oh, it looks like I accidentally graded it right away.

148
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,420
Okay, well, sorry for everyone who felt a little bit rushed there, my finger slipped.

149
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,220
Well, in either case, it's now been revealed that the answer is D, 2 to the x, okay?

150
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,780
And we can see this again if we go and just play around a little bit in our Desmos graphs.

151
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
So what we might do is pop over here,

152
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,820
and let me plug in 2 to the x, look at what that graph looks like.

153
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,260
So let's not look at our cosines anymore, 2 to the x.

154
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,020
And indeed if I take this whole thing and I square it,

155
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,900
on the one hand squaring usually does a kind of stretching motion in the y direction.

156
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,460
But what's neat about this shape is that it's exactly the same as taking 2 to the 2x.

157
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,540
And if you know anything about exponents, this kind of makes sense, because that 2 up here can get distributed into that x.

158
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
But what this means is that

159
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,980
exponents have this funny property that when you square them, it's a lot like scaling the input.

160
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,300
And of course the reason I bring that up is that you're looking at something very similar when it comes to cosine.

161
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,060
Just before, just by playing around with graphs, before you even know what they mean,

162
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,940
you can have this tiny little instinct in your head that says,

163
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,620
maybe,

164
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,380
just maybe,

165
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,780
cosine is somehow related to exponents.

166
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,220
It's not at all obvious how it is, but it absolutely is.

167
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,580
And that's one of the things that I'd like to get to by the end of the

168
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,420
end of the second lecture. We won't get the end of there today.

169
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,380
So with all of that, I think it's high time that we actually talk about what sine and cosine actually are.

170
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,500
I don't want to come in assuming that you necessarily know that already. So let's have a little moment to go back to the basics.

171
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,820
I think one of the best summaries of trigonometry that I ever heard,

172
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,780
and this was on Reddit, but I cannot for the life of me find it or remember who originally said this,

173
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,020
is you think that it's about triangles, but really it's about circles.

174
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,660
And this is absolutely true. I think between the time when I very first learned about trigonometry and now,

175
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:37,860
I think my mind shifted from fundamentally thinking of a triangular-based definition, which we'll talk about in a moment, to circles.

176
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,940
And let me just show you what I mean with respect to the circles, because that's the one that

177
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,100
explains how it comes up in physics and often how to get intuitions about where the values will be.

178
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,780
So instead of our Desmos graph, I'm going to go ahead and pull up a couple animations here.

179
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,180
So in this one,

180
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,420
I'll explain what sine of theta is,

181
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,420
where theta is the input, and it's going to be a measure of how far you've walked around a circle.

182
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,180
So I want you to imagine that you've started on the rightmost side of a circle that has a radius of one, okay?

183
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,900
And then as you walk around at a constant rate,

184
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
as a function of how far you've walked,

185
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,500
we're going to graph your height, which is to say your y-axis on this grid.

186
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,020
Maybe you'd think of it as the distance between u and the x-axis.

187
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,500
And as you do that, you get this wave that oscillates. And it kind of makes sense how it's just going to oscillate

188
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,380
on and on no matter how far you walk, which is why when we go back over to the Desmos graph,

189
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
and you think of something like cosine of x,

190
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,900
not the squared version, let's just do the plain vanilla cosine x, you know, it goes on forever continuing to cycle like this.

191
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,420
And I guess here I'm explaining sine of x, but it works the same way. If instead I type

192
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,940
sine of x, we get a similar looking shape. The only difference is that it starts at zero.

193
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,280
And we can take a look to explain why here, because

194
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,500
if by definition, if it's giving your y-coordinate when you start off to the right, it starts at zero before slowly increasing, okay?

195
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,740
Now by contrast,

196
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,620
cosine, it's defined very similarly, but it's giving you the x-coordinate as you walk around that circle.

197
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,500
So the distance to the vertical line, and in that context it starts off at one, and then as you walk around the circle,

198
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,420
your distance

199
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:31,940
from that y-axis, your x-coordinate, is going to get lower. It ultimately gets down to negative one before it starts increasing again.

200
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,060
Okay.

201
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,820
So this is how you might think of sine and cosine with respect to circles. The input is a kind of,

202
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,740
it's a kind of distance around a unit circle,

203
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,940
but you could think of that as an angle, and we're going to talk in a moment about the difference between degrees and radians.

204
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,460
But when you're thinking about walking around the circle, if it has a radius of one,

205
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,540
you can think of that input as being the literal distance that you walk. So as an example,

206
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,820
notice what happens when we get to the distance pi.

207
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,500
Okay.

208
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,540
Pi

209
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,940
gives you the semi-circumference of

210
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,580
one of these circles. If it's got a radius of one,

211
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,780
then the distance that it takes to get halfway around is pi, which is why at that input pi,

212
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
you see the output go to negative one.

213
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,700
At half of that, if you turn to 90 degree angle, which means walking around a distance of pi halves,

214
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,580
that's why cosine is zero at that point.

215
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
So now I'm going to ask you another question

216
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,660
where we're going to consider the input in terms of this idea of a distance around the unit circle.

217
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,460
Okay, and I'm just going to have you guess at some of the values for sine and cosine.

218
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
So we'll go ahead and pull up our quiz again.

219
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
And this time,

220
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
let's get it up on here.

221
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,300
What does our question say?

222
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,620
Without looking it up or using a calculator,

223
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
which of the following is true?

224
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,340
And it's reminding us that that input 3 is going to be considered in radians, which is to say the distance around

225
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,980
the unit circle, if you're just walking along at the arc length.

226
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,980
Okay, option A, the sine of 3 is around 0.14 and the cosine of 3 is around 0.99.

227
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,740
B,

228
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,740
the sine of 3 is around 0.14 and the cosine of 3 is around negative 0.99.

229
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,420
C, sine of 3 is around 0.99, cosine of 3 is around 0.14.

230
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:31,160
And D, sine of 3 is around negative 0.99 and cosine of 3 is around 0.14.

231
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,260
Okay, so just to give you a little moment to

232
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,620
think that through, it seems like there's not a hundred percent consensus on this question and answers are still rolling in.

233
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,780
So I'm going to go ahead and

234
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
give you a little bit of pause and ponder music.

235
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,880
I'll let you just think about it. I don't want you to feel rushed here.

236
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
So,

237
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
so

238
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,260
Okay, so I think this is probably a pretty good time to start grading things.

239
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
So the correct answer

240
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,020
is B, and it looks like the majority of you got the correct answer,

241
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,460
which is to say that sine is 0.14 and cosine is negative 0.99.

242
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,820
Now the specific numbers here don't matter. What's actually relevant is just kind of whether it's positive or negative,

243
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,020
and whether it's very close to one or if it's closer to zero.

244
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,940
So if we think through what this might mean in the context of our graphs here,

245
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,500
the cosine, which remember is measuring the x-coordinate of your little dot as you walk around the circle,

246
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,260
what is that going to be when you input 3?

247
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,300
Well, what does it mean to walk three units around the circle?

248
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, like I just mentioned, walking pi units around the circle gets you halfway around.

249
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,980
This is really the way to think about pi is it's you've got a unit circle, it takes you halfway around.

250
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,340
So to walk three units is going to be something a little bit shy of that.

251
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,100
Okay.

252
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,700
And if you notice, there's very little change in the x direction as you're at that left side of the circle.

253
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,740
So when it approaches one, it gets really close to one and then it doesn't really change that much.

254
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,460
So maybe it shouldn't be too surprising that our cosine of three turned out to be around 0.99.

255
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,340
What's relevant is that it's negative, right? It's very close to negative one. So it's close to negative 0.99.

256
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,020
Now on the other hand, if we were doing this with sine, which same game, but it's measuring your y-coordinate,

257
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
when you walk almost halfway around,

258
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,500
which is to say almost pi radians,

259
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,280
well, there's still a little bit of height left and importantly it's positive because you're still above that x-axis.

260
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,020
So when we turn back to our question, the only thing differentiating our answers was that some of them

261
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,100
would switch whether sine or cosine was the one that's close to negative one and the others would just switch the sine,

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,380
s-i-g-n, whether it's positive or negative.

263
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,580
So congratulations to the 3152 of you who got that one correct.

264
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,820
So that's loosely how you might think about sine and cosine if we're coming at it from the direction of circles.

265
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,180
But this is very different from how it's usually taught if we're doing things

266
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,300
like in a typical high school class where you start off thinking about right triangles. One is not better,

267
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,260
they're just very different and worth understanding the connection.

268
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,220
So the classic thing when it comes to trig functions is

269
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,440
a little statement that everyone has ringing through their head called so-ka-toa.

270
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,660
Okay, and what you're supposed to remember from this is if we have a right triangle, so let me go ahead and draw

271
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
a right triangle.

272
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,100
So we know one of the angles is 90 degrees and if you know another one of the angles, theta,

273
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,520
then consider one of the sides to be the hypotenuse.

274
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,980
And then you ask

275
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,860
what of the other two legs is adjacent to that angle and we label it a for adjacent and which of them is opposite.

276
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,460
So then so-ka-toa, if that's a phrase that you remember running through your head, tells you that

277
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,020
the sine

278
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,100
of this angle, this is the definition of sine for some kind of angle that we input,

279
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,220
is for such a right triangle, it's the opposite over the hypotenuse. That's what this is telling us, opposite over hypotenuse.

280
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Similarly, the cosine

281
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,020
of that angle

282
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
is going to equal the

283
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,600
adjacent over the hypotenuse. So that would be adjacent over hypotenuse.

284
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
Okay, and then the tangent

285
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
of that angle

286
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,260
is going to be the opposite over the adjacent. Okay, so that opposite side o

287
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,420
over the adjacent side.

288
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
So there's the classic thing to remember.

289
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,980
If students come out of a trig class, if they know one thing, they typically know so-ka-toa.

290
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
And to give us an example of

291
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,420
how you might apply this, I'm going to go ahead and pull up another question here for you,

292
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,660
which is going to ask us about a leaning tower, a leaning tower of Pisa.

293
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,980
Clearing out the last one, let's read what our new question has to say.

294
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,460
Suppose that a tower is 100 meters high.

295
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,380
After several years, the tower starts to lean, so instead of making a 90 degree angle with the ground, it makes an 80 degree angle.

296
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
When the sun is directly overhead,

297
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,900
what is the length of the shadow cast by this leaning tower?

298
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,260
Okay, the length of the shadow cast by this leaning tower.

299
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,700
I would highly encourage you to try drawing this out yourself.

300
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,700
I'm absolutely going to draw it for you in a moment, but it's more fun if you're engaged and if you have a pencil and paper

301
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,700
to noodle it out. You could also try to imagine it in your head if you want, but

302
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,580
for me at least, I always think much more clearly once I have pencil and paper, no matter how much I think I can think

303
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,580
things through in my head.

304
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,800
So let's give you a little pause and ponder time on this one.

305
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
So

306
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,260
Looks like we have some very strong consensus on this one, which is very reassuring.

307
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,100
And I guess one thing that should maybe go without saying, especially given that I've turned the

308
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,780
Super Chat or the Live Chat into the very aggressive slow mode.

309
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,340
This is most fun if you don't know what the majority of people are already thinking.

310
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,940
The whole idea of the statistics is right now you can see there's a bandwagon.

311
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:15,460
There's 2,600 people who are voting for one of the answers who think that's it, but we don't know what one of those answers is.

312
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,420
So if you have the answer, try not to just blurt it out in the Live Chat.

313
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,180
That's kind of the equivalent of a student in a classroom where when the teacher asks something

314
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,580
rather than raising their hand to ask it or submitting it quietly, just shouting.

315
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,100
I get it, you're excited, you really want to do it. But in this case,

316
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
it's a little bit more fun if we have the slow reveal.

317
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,060
All right, so that's probably enough time for people to have rolled their answers in. Now let's go ahead and see what they

318
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
see what the majority has submitted.

319
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,940
And

320
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,860
the correct answer is B,

321
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,020
which is 100 times the cosine of 80.

322
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,660
And it looks like the second most common answer was A, which is 100 times the sine of 80.

323
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
So it looks like you guys correctly

324
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,500
knew that you were multiplying it by one of these trigonometric functions,

325
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,060
but there might have just been a little swap up for which one was which. So let's think this through, okay?

326
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,060
Let's go back to our paper.

327
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,860
And our question had us imagine a tower,

328
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,140
which is 100 meters tall.

329
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,220
And specifically it said it was 100 meters tall and then it started tilting, so we can think of the length of the tower

330
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,100
as 100 meters. That's not necessarily how far its new top is off of the ground.

331
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,300
And then it has us imagine that there's the sun directly overhead, okay?

332
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,660
So it's going to be casting a shadow perpendicular to the ground. That's what gives us our nice right triangle.

333
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,260
And it further specified that the angle here was 80 degrees, okay?

334
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,420
So the thing we want to know is this side here, the length of the shadow, which if we look at our SOHCAHTOA,

335
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,380
that's the adjacent side. So we might write for ourselves

336
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
cosine of this angle, which is 80 degrees,

337
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,100
is equal to

338
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,980
that adjacent side, the thing that we want to know, I'll just call it x, or maybe I'll call it s for shadow,

339
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
try to give our variables readable meanings,

340
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,740
divided by the hypotenuse, which is 100.

341
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:18,100
So that means that the shadow, once we rearrange, is 100 times the cosine of 80 degrees.

342
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,700
Now already this feels very different from the thought of trigonometry via circles.

343
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,460
Like I said, you start to think about it in terms of triangles later it comes to circles.

344
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,940
One of the main differences here is that

345
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
we're dealing with a different unit, right?

346
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,060
Here I was saying degrees, and that's very natural when we're in the context of triangles.

347
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,900
We could also talk about angles in terms of radians, like I'll say in a moment, but

348
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,780
when humans assign numbers and numerical systems to things, we really like whole numbers between 0 and 100.

349
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,900
We just love that. Instead of thinking of proportions, we think in terms of percentages, which is the same thing,

350
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,380
but it just turns it to whole numbers between 0 and 100.

351
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,700
When we think about like sound with decibels, which scales a whole bunch and it's got this crazy exponential pattern to it,

352
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,980
we logarithmically change it and we have this very awkward system

353
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,380
that's really twisting the math behind its back so that we can think of whole numbers between 0 and 100.

354
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,460
Same deal with what's going on with degrees, but mathematicians don't really like that.

355
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,020
They don't really like to think in terms of degrees because it's so unnatural. Instead,

356
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,980
they want some sort of natural unit, something where you imagine if you talk to an alien civilization about math, they would have the same conventions.

357
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,300
So how does any of this connect to the unit circle and the idea of the distance around that unit circle that we were walking,

358
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,980
like we saw earlier?

359
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,580
Well,

360
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,220
let me just pull up a pre-printed unit circle because trust me, you don't want to see me try to draw a circle.

361
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,300
What's neat here is we can, for each of these triangles, imagine rescaling it

362
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,500
so that that hypotenuse is really 1 because all we care about are ratios of lengths of sides.

363
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,900
So we might as well say, okay, let's scale this so that the hypotenuse is 1, meaning we divide everything by h.

364
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
And what that's going to get us

365
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:07,140
is the opposite side is now o over h, whatever that was, and then the adjacent side is a over h,

366
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,540
meaning that the y, or the vertical component here, is

367
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,660
sine of theta,

368
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
where theta was our angle down here.

369
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,100
Okay.

370
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,740
And then that bottom part is cosine of theta.

371
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,580
Okay.

372
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,340
And if we want to think about all possible right triangles who have a hypotenuse of 1,

373
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,980
what you might think of is taking a unit circle because that's saying every point is a distance of 1 away,

374
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,860
so think of that line as the hypotenuse of a triangle. If you have a triangle with a bigger angle,

375
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,060
it shows up there. If you have a triangle with a smaller angle,

376
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,800
it shows up there. And it's as if you take all possible right triangles,

377
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,300
and you fix them so that their points are all in common, and such that their hypotenuses are all 1, you scale them down.

378
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,020
And the other tip of the triangle is going to trace out a unit circle like this.

379
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,760
And each one of these points for the corresponding angle is going to have coordinates

380
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,900
cosine of theta as the x-coordinate, and then sine of theta for the y-coordinate.

381
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,060
And I'm just writing it vertically so I can fit it all on here. Okay.

382
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,940
Now typically, like I said, mathematicians like to think in terms of radians,

383
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,820
which is really a way of saying if we know that the radius of our circle is 1,

384
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
what is the distance that you've walked

385
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:36,900
along the outside here? Okay. So for example, if you were to say 180 degrees,

386
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:44,500
excuse me, degrees, which is walking halfway around the circle, that's the same as pi radians.

387
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,620
And if you were to take something like 60 degrees,

388
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,300
okay, which would maybe end up, oh, I don't know, around here,

389
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
that might be 60 degrees.

390
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,900
Well, that's a third of that. You're walking a third of the half turn around the circle.

391
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,700
Everyone who's an enthusiast about tau is sort of yelling right now because it would make the conventions easier.

392
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,300
But pi is the standard, so we're working with it. It's pi thirds radians.

393
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,220
Okay, so from this point forward, and really for a lot of your math career,

394
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,100
I would encourage you to, every time you want to think in terms of degrees, where that makes the angle intuitive,

395
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,420
try to translate it to radians because that's going to be the more natural way to understand it.

396
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,420
And the farther you get down the road when it comes to how sine and cosine play into calculus, how you actually find values of them,

397
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,260
almost all of the time it's easier to think of that input in terms of radians.

398
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,700
So I think it's high time I ask you a couple questions about these.

399
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,900
And you might wonder, you know, how do we actually compute some of the values, right? How to compute.

400
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
And the honest answer is that it's hard.

401
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:59,140
If there was an easy answer to say, oh, well, this is the formula that shows you what sine of theta is,

402
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,620
we wouldn't have given sine of theta a fancy name.

403
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,740
We would just always work in terms of that formula, and we would call it the circle y coordinate formula.

404
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,160
And it might get a name, but it wouldn't be a special function. It wouldn't have a special button on your calculator.

405
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Because effectively what you have to do

406
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,900
is,

407
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:21,800
before you know fancy techniques associated with calculus or associated with even fancier things like what's known as the quartic algorithm,

408
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,420
you just have to have a handful of values that you do know that come from geometric settings where there's enough symmetry.

409
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,660
So for example, let's say I try to draw an equilateral triangle.

410
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,220
Okay.

411
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
An equilateral triangle will be nice and symmetric.

412
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:46,680
And we're going to be able to leverage that symmetry to figure out a concrete value of sine and cosine.

413
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
This looks roughly equilateral, wouldn't you say?

414
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,980
And let's say each of those side lengths is one because, you know, if we get to choose our side lengths,

415
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,180
why not one?

416
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,700
Because remember sine and cosine have everything to do with just ratios.

417
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
So on an equilateral triangle,

418
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,740
this angle here is a third of the total. The total is 180 degrees, so you might think of this as 60 degrees.

419
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:20,100
But like I said earlier, I would encourage you to try to get in the habit of thinking of that instead of 60 degrees,

420
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,700
say, okay, the full angle is pi, so a third of that is going to be pi thirds.

421
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,260
And then similarly this one up here is half that angle. Here's where we're leveraging that symmetry to some extent.

422
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,660
That one is 30 degrees,

423
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:42,660
which in terms of radians is now a sixth of a half turn. All the tau enthusiasts get very mad at this point.

424
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,020
But again, hey, it's the convention.

425
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,300
This is the thing that you should come out of a trig class knowing in your head

426
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:53,060
how to think in terms of radians measured in pi because that's how we often write it down in tests and such.

427
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180
So that one will be pi sixths.

428
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,580
So one thing I might ask you now is if you can leverage the symmetry of the setup,

429
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,420
the fact that equilateral triangles are going to be very nice and that the right triangle coming about from it is very nice,

430
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,580
to answer something like

431
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
a very concrete calculation,

432
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,380
what is the sine of pi sixths?

433
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,940
Okay, what do you think it is?

434
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,580
And in fact, let's do this as another live question, which as you can see I'm like a kid in a candy shop.

435
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
I'm just very enthusiastic with my new toy.

436
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,620
So,

437
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,900
let's go ahead and use it. Pull up another question here.

438
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
And what does our question ask?

439
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,700
What is the sine of pi sixths, of course?

440
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,900
So again, if you want, if you're just joining now, you can hop over to 3b1b.co.live.

441
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,580
You can answer that.

442
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,860
I imagine the best way to do this if you're doing it live is you might be answering on your phone, watching on another screen,

443
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,420
or if you want to switch between tabs, that's also good.

444
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,260
Now while those answers are rolling in,

445
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,860
let's take a look to see if we have anything from the audience. And we do.

446
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,220
When you do maths problems, do you use pen or pencil?

447
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:07,620
For sure, I use pencil. I mean, one, I'm very error prone. So I'm going to make mistakes all the time.

448
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,220
The only reason I'm writing in pen now is because it shows up better on the camera.

449
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,780
And let me just tell you, with every stroke that I write, I'm deeply terrified that there's about to be an error,

450
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,420
because I know there will be. So if that terror doesn't show in the shaking of my hands, then

451
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,860
you'll start to notice it from this point forward.

452
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,900
Back to our question though,

453
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,460
it looks like we've got pretty strong consensus now, around 2,091 people agreeing on one of the answers,

454
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,220
and then a pretty even split among the other ones. Oh, no, no, I guess

455
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,260
the length of the bar is a little, whoever worked on the scaling,

456
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,940
maybe a little bit misleading. It looks like one of the answers is much less popular than the other two.

457
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,180
But I guess the,

458
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,140
it's considering them to start from somewhere like that.

459
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:57,460
Maybe we should have some axes on there indicating that. So there's one very unpopular answer, and then one very popular answer.

460
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
So let's go ahead and see what that turns out to be.

461
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,380
Correct answer is one half.

462
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Congratulations to the

463
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:14,180
2800, no, no, 2915 of you coming into the last minute there to pull in a correct answer.

464
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,140
Okay, so why is that the case? Why is that necessarily going to be one half? Well, remember,

465
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,740
sine of pi six, we're asking SOHCAHTOA. So kind of remember in your head, sine is opposite over adjacent,

466
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
opposite over hypotenuse, excuse me.

467
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,780
So with respect to this smaller angle, maybe I'll change colors,

468
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,700
with respect to this smaller angle, the opposite side is

469
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,820
this segment here. And because of the symmetry of our triangle, that's going to be one half.

470
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,100
Because each side length of the equilateral triangle is one, so half of it should be one half.

471
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,540
And divided by the hypotenuse, but by definition the hypotenuse was one here. So one half divided by one, it's just the same as one half.

472
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,380
Now,

473
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,780
slightly trickier is if I'd asked you the cosine of pi six.

474
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,180
And let's do this one again as a live quiz, but maybe a little bit more quickly this time.

475
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,980
I'm going to hop over, get to our next question.

476
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:18,660
And as you might expect, the next question is going to ask you to find the cosine of pi divided by six. There we go.

477
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,540
And your options are a, one half,

478
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,500
b, square root of two divided by two,

479
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,580
c, square root of three divided by two, or d, square root of five divided by two.

480
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,460
If you can, I would highly encourage you to be keeping your own notes, right?

481
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,860
So if you wanted to kind of check back on your own piece of paper,

482
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,580
you could take a look through it as you're working out these questions. But for right now, I'm just going to give you

483
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,820
maybe 20 seconds or so to kind of noodle through it, think of what it might be.

484
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Get a little pause and ponder music going.

485
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Okay.

486
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:19,540
Once again, it looks like we have some pretty kind of strong consensus from about the same number of people that we had before.

487
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,180
So let's go ahead and grade the answers.

488
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:31,060
And the correct one is c, square root of three divided by two. So congratulations to the 3183 of you,

489
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,780
who knew that it was square root of three divided by two.

490
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,660
Now, how do you figure something like that out?

491
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,760
Well, the trick is basically if you have one of these right triangles,

492
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,780
if you know one of their sides, then you know both of them. So let me draw a little copy for ourselves here.

493
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,780
We know that the hypotenuse is one, one of the side lengths is one half,

494
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,140
and the only thing that's missing if we're thinking the cosine of 30 degrees is this adjacent side.

495
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,660
So because we were doing it with the angle up there, adjacent side is here.

496
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,540
Now the Pythagorean theorem tells us that

497
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,020
that adjacent value squared plus the other leg length squared

498
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,860
is going to equal one squared,

499
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,820
or hypotenuse squared.

500
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,740
Which means

501
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,980
that value is equal to the square root

502
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,900
of one minus, well, what's one half squared? It's one fourth.

503
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Which means it is the square root

504
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,980
of one minus a fourth is three fourths.

505
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,020
So we can go ahead and take the square root of that bottom and just leave the radical in the top.

506
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,700
And what we get is the square root of three all divided by two.

507
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,100
Now this is a value that

508
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,500
anybody coming out of a trig class becomes very familiar with. They're like, okay, if the answer isn't one half,

509
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,740
it's going to be square root of three over two.

510
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,720
Or root two over two also comes up in another circumstance.

511
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,340
But this is one of those that kind of becomes burned in your memory. Square root of three divided by two.

512
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,180
And one very important fact that's come about here that's worth highlighting is that, hmm,

513
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,500
how does the Pythagorean theorem play into

514
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,260
our trigonometry? Because if we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is one, and we know that one of the side lengths...

515
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,020
Let me switch to thinking with respect to this lower left angle again.

516
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,540
If one of the side lengths is cosine of theta,

517
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,060
and one of them is sine of theta,

518
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,020
well, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that cosine of x squared

519
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,820
plus sine of x squared is always equal to one squared.

520
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,820
Okay?

521
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,500
Now this is a very important identity.

522
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,900
It basically tells you if you know cosine, you know sine. If you know sine, you know cosine.

523
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,060
And it also is giving you a little reminder that it's all really about the Pythagorean theorem.

524
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,340
In fact, this is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem, because if you think of how cosine and sine are defined,

525
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:00,100
it's just defined in terms of the leg lengths of a right triangle, and then everything scaled down as needed.

526
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,940
Now there's one very silly convention with how we write these things.

527
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,300
So we've already started to make friends with the cosine of x squared function, and the fact that it's a little more interesting than

528
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,060
you might think at first sight.

529
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,500
But you never see it written down as open parenthesis cosine of x closed parenthesis squared,

530
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,300
because people don't want to write too many parentheses.

531
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,220
Instead, they write cosine squared of x

532
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,060
plus sine squared of x.

533
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
It's all very nice.

534
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,100
How lovely. We don't have to write too many symbols. What a wonderful convention.

535
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,300
Except for the fact that literally every other time in math, you see something written as f

536
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,220
squared of x, what that means is not

537
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,740
f of x squared. That's almost never what it means. Instead, what it's supposed to mean for most of math

538
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,460
is taking a function and applying it to itself,

539
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:02,020
like layering it over itself. That's what that 2 usually refers to. Sometimes later on it refers to the second derivative,

540
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:08,360
especially if it has some parentheses around it. But the idea is that it's very different from the convention in trigonometry.

541
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,120
Trigonometry is just flying by its own rules and saying, yeah, yeah,

542
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,160
we've got our own conventions for what it means when you put a little 2 up there.

543
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,860
I understand some students will be confused, but I'm trigonometry. I don't care. I'm moving forward with my conventions.

544
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,720
And that's fine, right? You get used to it.

545
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,800
This is the standard way that you'll end up seeing it. What I was writing earlier when we were thinking about the cosine squared function,

546
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
which again is very interesting,

547
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,600
you would almost always see it written as cos squared of x.

548
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:43,960
Now, very interesting is that this is not just a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem

549
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,320
that gives us a relation between our trig functions. At the end of the lecture,

550
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,680
I want to show you how you can use trig functions to prove the Pythagorean theorem in a sneaky way.

551
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,520
And it's pretty sneaky. Like it's not one of the common proofs that you'll see that's associated with, you know, rearranging

552
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,920
triangles or anything like that, but it is very visually satisfying. So that's something that we'll get to by the end of the lecture.

553
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,320
But in the meantime, I want to think through a couple more of our

554
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,800
of our trig function questions. Okay, so we kind of come back up here. We just found cosine of pi sixths,

555
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
which is square root of three over two.

556
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,440
But let's answer it for a couple more complicated ones, right?

557
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,760
So far I'm dealing only with angles that were between zero and 90 degrees, or I should say between zero and pi halves.

558
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,560
But let's try a question that's a little bit different from that.

559
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
And what if I instead said

560
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,000
cosine

561
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
of negative two pi

562
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,560
over three?

563
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,160
Okay.

564
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,840
Now that's one that is hard to think of in terms of triangles, because what does it mean to have a negative angle?

565
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
So this is a good reminder that

566
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,640
cosine and sine, even if you think they're about triangles, are really about circles.

567
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,520
And remember, if you walk all the way around the circle, and if it has a radius of one,

568
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,120
walking all the way around the circle is going to take you a distance of two pi.

569
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,960
Okay, so if you want to think about two pi thirds, what you might start by doing is chopping the triangle

570
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,840
into thirds,

571
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,160
and then using that to help guide the intuitions. But again, I kind of want to do this as a live quiz.

572
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
So let's go ahead and pull up the next question.

573
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,520
And have you guys answer this for me. What do you think the cosine of two pi divided by three?

574
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,920
Now let's go ahead and pull it up.

575
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,200
Cosine of negative two pi divided by three.

576
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,520
Okay. So again, if you're keeping notes, that can be very helpful. You reference your notes now.

577
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,120
But just to make sure that you have enough time to think this through,

578
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,820
I'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit more of that pause and ponder music.

579
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,880
It looks like one of you

580
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,920
figured out how to submit an answer that is not

581
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,960
one of the four multiple choices.

582
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,760
So other than that, we've got a very strong lead

583
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,720
with 1152 of you as I say this agreeing on one of the answers.

584
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,680
And then

585
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,880
second place

586
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,640
by about a factor of four is going to sit on another one. I'm curious about actually what

587
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,840
what all the answer distribution here is. I'm very curious about oh now we have a sixth. Okay, so two of you have now

588
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,160
gone outside the realm of the typical multiple choice universe and have entered your own things.

589
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,280
Two of you sit there and say I don't want one of your choices.

590
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,320
I figured out my own answer and you just didn't put it in your form.

591
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,800
So I'm going to figure out a way to submit it differently.

592
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
If only you could do that on the SAT.

593
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
What is the answer? A through E.

594
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
Sir, I think the answer is J.

595
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,400
1729! We got Ramanujan's constant. Oh, if I pause it now though, it's not going to stay there.

596
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
For a brief glorious moment

597
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,420
we had a wonderful number. Maybe I can pause it around the year though because it's 1999.

598
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,420
2031. Okay. Well, I've paused it in the future.

599
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,680
So the correct answer in this context is negative one half.

600
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,600
Okay, and it looks like the second most common answer was D which is negative root three over two.

601
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,400
Okay, so that's very good because often it's kind of this back and forth between whether you think it's

602
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,760
a half or whether you think it's root three over two.

603
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Because it's sort of the difference between

604
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,440
things that feel like 30 degree angles and things that feel like 60 degree angles.

605
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,720
So let's take a look back at our drawing and see how we might think about this.

606
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,040
So like I said negative two pi divided by three that's taking us a negative distance

607
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,080
over here and this is why cosine will be a negative number because the x coordinate

608
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,360
is pointing in the negative direction.

609
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:02,600
And if you want to think of this in terms of triangles I might draw this triangle here and ask what is this angle?

610
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,040
Okay, we know that it's 90 degrees plus something

611
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
or pi halves plus something.

612
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:16,220
And negative two pi over thirds if we wanted to think in terms of degrees if that's something we're more comfortable with that's negative 360

613
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,680
divided by three.

614
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,280
You know degrees

615
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,920
which is negative 120 degrees.

616
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,200
So if it takes 120 degrees to get around here then that minus the 90 degree angle between the x and y axis

617
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,760
gives us 30 degrees.

618
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Okay, so then the question is

619
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,680
what is the cosine of this value? What is the x coordinate there?

620
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,600
With your 30, 60, 90 triangles it's just kind of a nice thing to remember that the shorter side

621
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,680
is one half and the longer side is root three over two.

622
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,520
And if you forget y it's exactly the diagram that we just drew before.

623
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,980
Associated with

624
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,120
equilateral triangles, right? Because if you imagine taking an equilateral triangle and chopping it in half

625
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,720
then the shorter side has length one half and then the longer side comes from the Pythagorean theorem.

626
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,220
So

627
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,320
congratulations to those of you who correctly found that.

628
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,120
Now I want to bring back that identity that you guys found at the very beginning, okay?

629
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,440
Associated with cosine squareds and cosine of two thetas and show how that extends our capability for

630
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,120
making some of these computations and figuring out certain values. So let's remind ourselves what that actually was, okay?

631
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm going to go back here. I'm going to pull up again the Desmos graph

632
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,720
and remember how what we said is that cosine squared

633
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,340
which looks like this little scaled down version of cosine

634
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,840
oscillating more quickly is the same as

635
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,520
cosine of two x, that quicker oscillation, but we had to kind of shift it and rescale it to make them equal.

636
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,080
So now we're going to use that fact that you can discover just by playing around with graphs

637
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,080
to make a computation that otherwise would be pretty tricky to make.

638
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,140
And I think that when you're able to make concrete computations

639
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,680
it's often a reflection of the fact that you have a deeper conceptual understanding of what's going on.

640
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,280
So even if it's always going to be your calculator computing this, you're not sitting here working out cosine values by hand,

641
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,000
the fact that you can is an illustrate that you understand that cosine function a little bit better.

642
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,080
So over on our paper, let me write down again what that identity was.

643
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,440
Let's go back to black, good old friendly black.

644
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Cosine squared of x,

645
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
using the dumb-dumb convention,

646
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,840
is one plus

647
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,380
cosine of two x.

648
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,480
This is kind of oscillating more quickly, all divided by two.

649
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,800
Okay.

650
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,680
So now I'm going to ask you a trickier question, which is going to be

651
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,640
what is the cosine of

652
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,800
pi

653
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,320
twelfths?

654
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,440
Okay.

655
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,400
And for those of you keeping track, pi twelfths is the same as 15 degrees.

656
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,560
So if we were doing this with a unit circle, what you might think is,

657
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,520
okay, a 30 degree angle

658
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,200
sits looking like this.

659
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,920
That's 30 degrees.

660
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,920
I'm now going to be taking half of that,

661
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,720
okay, half of that,

662
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,720
and I want to know the cosine of this value,

663
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,000
which is going to be the x coordinate of that value. And right away,

664
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,320
you can probably make a guess that it's very close to one, right, because it's a small angle,

665
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,640
and

666
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
the small angle means that our,

667
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,320
we haven't walked that far around a circle,

668
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
so we haven't gotten that far away from one,

669
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,120
especially given the fact that as you start to walk, almost all of your velocity is in the up and down direction.

670
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,460
All right, so cosine of pi twelfths, 15 degrees, you know what's about to happen, you know that this is a live quiz dynamic,

671
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
so let's pull it up.

672
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,000
All right.

673
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
What is the cosine of pi divided by 12?

674
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,400
Okay.

675
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,000
Lots of answers rolling in, very fun, very exciting. Again, if you just happen to be tuning in now,

676
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,800
you haven't been following along before, go to 3b1b.co.live.

677
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,780
Your answers will become part of what you're seeing on screen. It affects the overall distribution.

678
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,640
This one, unlike what we had before,

679
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,280
much less overall consensus,

680
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,840
and it definitely seems to be taking a bit more time, so

681
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,600
I'm going to just stop talking and give you some some pause and ponder moments here because

682
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,680
this one is tricky. This one takes time to think through.

683
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So

684
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Now

685
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,920
it looks like there's a total of five of you who have extended beyond the realm of usual multiple choice.

686
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,880
By the way,

687
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,280
as you guys are entering answers here, let me just say a huge thanks to Ben Eater and Cam Christensen.

688
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,480
They're the ones who actually worked on the item pool website that is making all of this possible.

689
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,640
Eater, many of you might recognize from his own YouTube channel

690
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,120
named Ben Eater about computer engineering. If you haven't checked it out, you absolutely should.

691
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,400
And then item pool is a pretty cool thing that will be unfolding

692
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,880
over the next coming months and year, so you might want to keep your eye on that.

693
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,800
It looks like some more consensus is starting to form, so I'm going to go ahead and grade this question.

694
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,200
All right, it looks like I'm getting a phone call.

695
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,720
Awesome. So the correct answer is b, which is square root of, it's a very complicated thing, right?

696
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,720
Square root of one plus the square root of three over two divided by two.

697
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:25,720
So congratulations to the two two two nine of you who, two two two four two two four three,

698
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,920
two thousand two hundred forty three of you. How are the answers still changing?

699
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,520
How are the answers still changing? Gonna have to talk to Cam and Eater about that.

700
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,800
My hands are not on this. Who got that correct? Now it looks like the second most common answer

701
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,920
was a, which is of a very similar form. There's just a minus sign in there, so it's probably the

702
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,360
case that while doing the arithmetic, something got flipped. We're going to walk through it in a

703
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,600
moment so you can see. And a special congratulations to the two of you who figured out how to submit

704
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,360
an at sign on this. Ooh, the three of you who submitted an at sign. It's not the correct answer,

705
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:05,880
but well done, well done, four of you. Very nice. All right, so clearly this is a complicated answer,

706
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:13,160
but where does it come from? Well, if we look at our identity here, the key is that it's relating

707
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:20,120
two times an angle to the angle itself. So if we just plug this in for 15 degrees or for pi twelfths,

708
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,440
what we would get is that the cosine squared of pi twelfths,

709
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:36,200
okay, if we enter that as x, is equal to one plus the cosine of two times that value, which is pi

710
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:45,960
sixths. Pi sixths, all divided by two. Now the cosine of pi sixths, we know, right? That's the same as

711
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,440
our 30 degree angle here. Again, when you have a 30, 60, 90 triangle, the shorter side of that,

712
00:53:52,440 --> 00:54:00,440
which is going to be the sign in this context, the shorter side is one half, and then the longer side

713
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,960
is square root of three over two, assuming that the hypotenuse is one, which in the context of the

714
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,520
unit circle we always do assume. So that means that we now have one plus the square root of three

715
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:18,200
over two, that's what the cosine of pi sixths was, all divided by two, which means our final answer,

716
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,800
when we just want to say cosine of pi twelfths, no squared about it,

717
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:32,200
is going to be the square root of this value. Okay, very interesting. So this is showing us that

718
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,160
cosine and sine can get complicated, right? We've got a handful of values like pi sixths and pi

719
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:42,440
thirds, where we can figure them out. We can have even more, I won't call them trivial values, but

720
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,560
easier to compute values, like cosine of pi, where you would look at your unit circle and say, oh pi,

721
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:53,640
that means I've walked halfway around, so my x coordinate is negative one, right? But outside of

722
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,080
just a handful of values like that, they're very hard to compute by hand, and in the olden days,

723
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,640
the only way that people could compute them by hand, before something like the existence of calculus,

724
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,960
would be measuring it, right? You like draw out with a protractor and you try to carefully see what

725
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,960
the coordinates are, or layering on usage of identities like this over and over in ways that

726
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,320
you can get approximate values like this. And just to check ourselves, we can actually go and plug

727
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:25,720
this into a calculator if we wanted to, something like Desmos, and just see, one, how big the value

728
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,200
is, and kind of confirm for ourselves that they turn out to be the same. So if we pop over here,

729
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:42,120
and I just type something like, cosine of pi over 12, 0.965. Okay, so like I said, very close to one,

730
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,680
and that's kind of what we would expect, and the answer we just got was the square root of one plus

731
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,320
the square root of three, I gotta make sure I do the divided by two correctly,

732
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:58,040
divided by two, right? That looks correct, but then all of that was divided by two, all that stuff on

733
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,680
the inside was divided by two, and indeed they're the same value, right? So even just something like

734
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:09,240
pi 12, we end up getting a very convoluted image. Now like I said, this is a reflection of the fact

735
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,480
that our cosine identity that we found at the very beginning just by playing through with graphs,

736
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:19,320
it's definitely non-obvious, and what we'll find next time is that this is actually a shadow of the

737
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:25,000
fact that trigonometric functions are related to complex numbers, and the idea of doubling the

738
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,200
angle here corresponding to multiplying by something twice, not at all a coincidence. I think

739
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,920
it's very fun, I'm excited to show you guys all about that. Now what I wanted to do just to finish

740
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,800
things off here though, was to show two things that are not commonly shown about the unit circle, okay?

741
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,640
So we see where sine and cosine are, but there might be a couple questions. Where is tan? Okay,

742
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,880
where in our picture do we see tangent of theta, and then also where

743
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:02,280
is cosine of x or cosine of theta squared, or with the dumb convention cosine squared of theta.

744
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,760
So pulling up another one of my infinite supply of unit circles here,

745
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,400
actually you know what? This one's not going to have enough y-axis, so I'm going to do something that

746
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,520
I really shouldn't do, which is to try to use a compass live on camera. I'm sort of terrible

747
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,040
at using compasses because it always slips out for me, but we're just going to do this.

748
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:28,360
I'm so nervous that this is going to somehow slip out. Oh yeah, that actually didn't turn out too

749
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,560
badly. Hopefully the pencil shows up okay on screen. The reason I'm doing this is the tangent

750
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:39,240
is going to demand that we think outside of the box, that we think outside of the circle

751
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:47,560
in order to geometrically interpret it. You could just ask about the opposite divided by

752
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,000
the adjacent, which is where that SOHCAHTOA TOA comes from, but what I really want is a single

753
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,600
length in our diagram that corresponds to the tangent, so we can kind of get that nice geometric

754
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:05,400
intuitive feel for it. And the idea is we take that radius, which is one, and if we think of the

755
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,840
fact that tangent of theta, SOHCAHTOA, is supposed to be the opposite over the adjacent, I want a

756
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:18,600
triangle where that adjacent is equal to one. Okay, so a right triangle such that this one

757
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:26,360
is the adjacent side to our angle theta. Well, in order to do that, let's just draw a right angled

758
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:32,600
perpendicular line off of our radial line, and some of you might know that if you draw a

759
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,040
perpendicular line to the radius of a circle, it actually lies tangent to the circle. So you see

760
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,680
tangent, this is where the word comes from. Then what we have is a triangle where the adjacent side

761
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:52,440
to theta is one, and then the opposite side is this length here. So that length there is the tangent

762
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,600
of theta. And so right now you can kind of intuitively understand that as theta is very small,

763
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,120
when the opposite over adjacent is very close to zero, because that opposite is close to zero and

764
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,400
the adjacent is close to one, well indeed this length also is getting very close to zero. And

765
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,360
then you can also think through what happens as that angle approaches 90 degrees. This is something

766
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:21,880
I actually illustrated once before in a previous video, a lesser known video entitled tattoos on

767
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,960
math, that a fun fact includes someone who is behind the scenes as we say all of this right now.

768
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,800
But the idea is that when you draw that tangent line, tangent is this length that I just pointed

769
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,280
out to you. And in that context you could also think about cotangent, there's this whole other

770
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,160
triad of trigonometric functions that aren't worth teaching but are kind of historical quirks.

771
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,960
That's actually what that whole video was about. But from here you can just play around with moving

772
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:53,000
the angle theta and seeing what that does to this tangent value, to that tangent length. Okay.

773
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,400
And using that intuition actually I want you to place a guess on what the graph of tangent of theta

774
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,120
is going to look like. So once again let's go over to our live question dynamic. Again congratulations

775
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,520
to those of you who got the last one right. And as our final question before the end of this

776
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:14,040
particular stream, which is a rather tall question so it might actually pop up

777
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,520
over over below the values we have available here, is the final question. I just want you to guess

778
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:28,520
what the tangent of theta looks like when we graph it. Okay. And it should be pulled up now.

779
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:36,040
And oh there we go. It is rather tall though. Okay. All right so let me go ahead and pull up a

780
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,440
separate image for you here so that you can see all of the options. Let's pop over here

781
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,880
and take a look. Great. So again if you go to 3b1b.co.live where the link is in the description,

782
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,520
you can submit your answers to this. Basically which one of these graphs

783
01:00:53,320 --> 01:01:00,600
shows you the tangent of theta. Okay. Unfortunately we're going to have to kind of switch back and

784
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,160
forth to see the statistics. It looks like there's pretty strong consensus in one direction.

785
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,800
But I'm going to give you I'm going to give you a little bit more time to think about it if you

786
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,840
want to. Don't feel rushed. Don't feel like you have to jump right into it.

787
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,840
Hmm.

788
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,840
I want a little ambient pause and ponder music while we're at it.

789
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,840
I'm mildly addicted to it.

790
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,840
Okay.

791
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:12,040
All right. So while you're answering. So as we can see some people are clearly messing with the

792
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,600
website and having fun or there's a bug in the website to answer various other things. Other fun

793
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:23,960
thing going on. It seems like we've got a couple comments in the in the JSON associated with the

794
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:31,240
answers. So to the person who decided to skip over my very draconian limits on the live chat

795
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:38,040
dynamic and instead entered in JSON comment through the answer forum form. I really enjoyed

796
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:43,480
this class. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I appreciate your your hacky instincts. You're

797
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:49,000
going to go far in life, my friend. You're going to go very, very far. So let's go ahead and grade

798
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,880
this question here. It looks like we have very strong consensus, hopefully around the correct

799
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:02,280
answer. And the correct answer is a again, maybe a little bit hard to see on our on our indication

800
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,880
of the question over here. But a is the graph that looks like this. And what you'll notice is it

801
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:14,200
starts at zero. And then as you approach pi halves, it blows up to infinity. OK, now, in terms of the

802
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:21,000
animations and the geometric interpretation of tangent, that should actually make sense, because

803
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,640
if we go back to what we were looking at as the angle blows up, the angle doesn't blow up. The

804
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,360
angle does a very modest thing of simply going to pi halves, a fine number. But the tangent of that

805
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,920
angle is going to just get bigger and bigger. And ultimately, it's it's not defined. It's the same

806
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,280
as dividing by zero once you get to pi halves. And then after that, if you play the same game,

807
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:47,160
it's going to be it's going to be considered a negative value, which basically comes down to

808
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:52,760
the fact that the opposite and adjacent sides of our triangle are going to be considered to have

809
01:03:52,760 --> 01:04:00,760
separate signs. So the very last thing that I want to talk about, like I said, is the question of

810
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,960
where does cosine squared of theta show up in our image? Because this is the very thing that we open

811
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,840
with is trying to understand cosine squared. And you might think, oh, if we can see that in our

812
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,320
image somewhere, maybe it really reveals why it looks like a miniature version of the cosine wave.

813
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:19,320
Now, one of the naive things, not naive, but one of the first things you might try to do

814
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,440
is pull up the original cosine animation that we had or something like it and say, oh, well,

815
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm going to take that cosine length and literally square it. I'm just going to draw the square based

816
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,880
on that. And if I were to do this, where I'm going to plot the length of that horizontal line,

817
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,440
and I'm also going to plot the area of that square, it's a little bit complicated.

818
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:44,040
It certainly shows us what we already saw before, which is that the square of that value

819
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:49,400
looks like another cosine wave. But this is something where just by staring at the image,

820
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:55,400
it actually doesn't yield much insight. I think oftentimes in geometry or math, when you simply

821
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,560
write down the definition of things, the answer pops out. This is a sign that again, it's not

822
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:05,000
trivial. It's very unclear why the way that that square, that literal square would oscillate,

823
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,440
is going to be related to cosine, much less cosine of two theta. So it's going to come from

824
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:17,640
somewhere else inside our image. Okay. And for that, let me go ahead and draw a much bigger

825
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:25,240
triangle for ourselves. Let's say we've got one of these guys that was living inside the unit circle.

826
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,240
This, by the way, I think is the most exciting part of the lecture. So if there was just one

827
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,600
thing that you were going to stick around for, I would say that this is the thing that you should.

828
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,880
Because it gives a very sneaky proof of the Pythagorean theorem. It might feel like a circular

829
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,960
argument at first, but I assure you that it's not. And I also assure you that the word circular was

830
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,720
not meant as a pun there. So remember, if that's our angle theta, then one of our side lengths is

831
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,000
sine theta. And that's the angle theta. And that's the angle theta. And that's the angle theta.

832
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,880
Then one of our side lengths is sine of theta. And the other one is cosine of theta.

833
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:06,600
Let me ask you, if I draw, well okay, so you know, the the example we had earlier was this

834
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:12,040
leaning tower thing where we kind of imagined casting a shadow from a leaning tower onto the

835
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,840
ground. This is sort of going to flip it on its head and say, well this angle theta between them,

836
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,480
who's to say who's the tower and who's the ground? What if I wanted to have a light source over here

837
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,600
and I wanted to cast a shadow from the ground onto the tower? A nice perpendicular line in

838
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:33,400
this direction. That way my angle theta is going to do double duty for me. It's describing the

839
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:39,400
angle between these two lines, but in one context this ground line was the adjacent side, it was the

840
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,800
short side. But now if I ask you a question like, what is this side length? The shadow that the

841
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:51,080
ground lays down on the tower, if that's not more confusing than I want it to be,

842
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:59,640
what are we going to get? Well, in terms of this smaller right triangle that we've just created,

843
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:05,800
by definition the cosine of that angle is going to be the adjacent side, the thing we want to know,

844
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:12,760
maybe I'll call it s for shadow again. I'm going to write down what it equals. It's going to be

845
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:18,920
the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse, but for this little triangle the hypotenuse is cosine,

846
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:24,920
so it's divided by the cosine of theta, which means cosine squared of theta, dumb convention,

847
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,600
is equal to the answer that we want. Let me just write it down in a different color to really

848
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:39,080
emphasize. Cosine squared of theta. And let me emphasize, this is not using the Pythagorean

849
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,880
theorem in any way. This is not having the cosine squared arrive because we were assuming that this

850
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,720
sits on a circle where x squared plus y squared equals one. We're just using the definition of

851
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:53,160
cosine twice to cast one shadow and then to cast another. Now you can probably see where this is

852
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:58,440
going. Do the same thing for the sine of theta. So another place where theta shows up in our

853
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:04,680
diagram is right here, and a way that you can see that is that this angle plus something must

854
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:12,840
equal 90 degrees, right? But this other something plus r theta had to be the remaining angles of

855
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,240
the little right triangle that we had. Or you might think up here, I could just give it a different

856
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:25,880
name. If I called this other angle alpha, then we know that alpha plus theta plus 90 degrees,

857
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:33,160
or pi halves if you want to get used to the better conventions, has to equal pi. It's got to equal

858
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:40,120
180 degrees. This is maybe confusing. Just think alpha plus theta plus pi halves. In the back of

859
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:45,720
your mind you can go to 90 degrees if that's something you want for comfort. But that also

860
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,040
implies that when we have a new right triangle sitting here, this little angle here has got to

861
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,560
be theta because it's alpha plus 90 plus something, so that something's got to be theta. Now the reason

862
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,520
I have stated that so much is because we're going to play our same shadow casting game to figure

863
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:08,520
out what this side length is. Now with respect to that we have sine of theta of this theta in

864
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:15,080
particular is the opposite the new shadow we don't know. I'll call it s prime is equal to s prime

865
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:21,160
divided by the hypotenuse. Well on this smaller right triangle what was the long side has become

866
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:29,000
the hypotenuse so that's sine of theta. Sine of theta. Which means sine squared of theta

867
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:38,600
is our other shadow. This here is sine squared of theta. So that's kind of cool. The side length

868
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,080
which was by definition one because we've always been rescaling our triangles such that the

869
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:49,560
hypotenuse is one can be broken down into one part that's cosine squared and another part that's sine

870
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:55,240
squared and the way to break that down is to just draw a single line the perpendicular projection

871
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:01,960
from our corner point onto that hypotenuse. So what that means is every time you see a unit

872
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,400
circle out in the wild which I'm sure you do pretty regularly and you draw the standard triangle to

873
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:14,840
understand sine and cosine so that height is going to be sine the x coordinate is going to be cosine

874
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:22,840
and our hypotenuse is always one so that hypotenuse is one

875
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:29,080
but this is theta and you ask yourself where is cosine squared in this diagram where is sine

876
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:39,800
squared you can just draw a little perpendicular line here and the part on the bottom is cosine

877
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:50,360
squared so cos squared the theta is this length this length here and what we'll do in a future

878
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,880
lecture actually I want to talk about geometry and geometry proofs and in particular one that

879
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,400
comes up all the time I've used it in many past videos it's high time we just sit down and say

880
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:05,400
how would you prove it is the inscribed angle theorem so after showing you how complex numbers

881
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:10,760
play into things next time I want to turn back to this particular diagram to give another very

882
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,400
intuitive understanding for the identity that you found simply by playing around with graphs at the

883
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,200
very beginning here which again is a very non-trivial identity that the cosine squared of

884
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:26,200
some value is one plus the cosine of two times that value divided by two the more standard way

885
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:31,880
you see it by the way if you were to look this up in a textbook instead of writing this as x this is

886
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:38,520
commonly written as something like alpha halves for some angle and then 2x would be alpha and the

887
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:47,960
whole thing ends up looking like cosine of alpha divided by two is equal to the square root of one

888
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:57,400
plus cosine of alpha divided by two I for one I have such trouble memorizing the trig identities

889
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,560
and I always would just sort of re-derive them on the fly and this is one where I think the

890
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,720
easiest way to re-derive is to practice kind of smooshing around graphs in your head when you have

891
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:11,240
the one key insight which is that squaring cosine gets you a smaller cosine graph and the next time

892
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,720
I'll show you how complex numbers help you kind of re-derive a bunch of other identities on the fly

893
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,400
but this one in particular I just always had trouble remembering it's called the half angle

894
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,520
identity and I just think it's delightful that before you even know any trigonometry

895
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,720
simply hopping over to something like Desmos and being a little bit playful

896
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:34,200
that I mean that lands you on a highly non-trivial fact and once again it's one that indicates that

897
