1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,920
The months ahead of you hold within them a lot of hard work, some neat examples, some

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,180
not-so-neat examples, beautiful connections to physics, not-so-beautiful piles of formulas

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,580
to memorize, plenty of moments of getting stuck and banging your head into a wall, a

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,560
few nice aha moments sprinkled in as well, and some genuinely lovely graphical intuition

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,240
to help guide you through it all.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,960
But if the course ahead of you is anything like my first introduction to calculus, or

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,100
any of the first courses I've seen in the years since, there's one topic you will

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,400
not see, but which I believe stands to greatly accelerate your learning.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,620
You see, almost all of the visual intuitions from that first year are based on graphs.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,660
The derivative is the slope of a graph, the integral is a certain area under that graph.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,580
But as you generalize calculus beyond functions whose inputs and outputs are simply numbers,

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,020
it's not always possible to graph the function you're analyzing.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,320
So if all your intuitions for the fundamental ideas, like derivatives, are rooted too rigidly

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,160
in graphs, it can make for a very tall and largely unnecessary conceptual hurdle between

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,460
you and the more quote-unquote advanced topics like multivariable calculus and complex analysis,

16
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,580
differential geometry.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,360
What I want to share with you is a way to think about derivatives, which I'll refer

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,520
to as the transformational view, that generalizes more seamlessly into some of those more general

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,640
contexts where calculus comes up.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,860
And then we'll use this alternate view to analyze a fun puzzle about repeated fractions.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,960
But first off, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page about what the standard

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,660
visual is.

23
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,380
If you were to graph a function, which simply takes real numbers as inputs and outputs,

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,860
one of the first things you learn in a calculus course is that the derivative gives you the

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,840
slope of this graph, where what we mean by that is that the derivative of the function

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
is a new function which for every input x returns that slope.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,560
Now I'd encourage you not to think of this derivative as slope idea as being the definition

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,440
of a derivative.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,180
Instead think of it as being more fundamentally about how sensitive the function is to tiny

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,420
little nudges around the input.

31
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,780
And the slope is just one way to think about that sensitivity relevant only to this particular

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,900
way of viewing functions.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,960
I have not just another video, but a full series on this topic if it's something you

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
want to learn more about.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,080
The basic idea behind the alternate visual for the derivative is to think of this function

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,420
as mapping all of the input points on the number line to their corresponding outputs

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,820
on a different number line.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,420
In this context, what the derivative gives you is a measure of how much the input space

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,220
gets stretched or squished in various regions.

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,200
That is, if you were to zoom in around a specific input and take a look at some evenly spaced

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,200
points around it, the derivative of the function of that input is going to tell you how spread

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,600
out or contracted those points become after the mapping.

43
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,400
Here, a specific example helps.

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,920
Take the function x2, it maps 1 to 1, 2 to 4, 3 to 9, and so on.

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,220
You can also see how it acts on all of the points in between.

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,840
If you were to zoom in on a little cluster of points around the input 1, and see where

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,160
they land around the relevant output, which for this function also happens to be 1, you'd

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,900
notice that they tend to get stretched out.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,020
In fact, it roughly looks like stretching out by a factor of 2.

50
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,000
The closer you zoom in, the more this local behavior looks just like multiplying by a

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,820
This is what it means for the derivative of x2 at the input x equals 1 to be 2.

52
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,400
It's what that fact looks like in the context of transformations.

53
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,480
If you looked at a neighborhood of points around the input 3, they would get stretched

54
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,160
out by a factor of 6.

55
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,440
This is what it means for the derivative of this function at the input 3 to equal 6.

56
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,100
Around the input 1 fourth, a small region tends to get contracted specifically by a

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,360
factor of 1 half, and that's what it looks like for a derivative to be smaller than 1.

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
The input 0 is interesting.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,580
Zooming in by a factor of 10, it doesn't really look like a constant stretching or

60
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:17,960
squishing.

61
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,680
For one thing, all of the outputs end up on the right positive side of things.

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:34,080
As you zoom in closer and closer, by 100x or by 1000x, it looks more and more like a

63
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,960
And this is what it looks like for the derivative to be 0.

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,020
The local behavior looks more and more like multiplying the whole number line by 0.

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,060
It doesn't have to completely collapse everything to a point at a particular zoom level, instead

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,840
it's a matter of what the limiting behavior is as you zoom in closer and closer.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,960
It's also instructive to take a look at the negative inputs here.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,360
Things start to feel a little cramped since they collide with where all the positive input

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,780
values go, and this is one of the downsides of thinking of functions as transformations.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,600
But for derivatives, we only really care about the local behavior anyway, what happens in

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,640
a small range around a given input.

72
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,660
Here, notice that the inputs in a little neighborhood around, say, negative 2, don't just get

73
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,100
stretched out, they also get flipped around.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,900
Specifically, the action on such a neighborhood looks more and more like multiplying by negative

75
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,820
4 the closer you zoom in.

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
This is what it looks like for the derivative of a function to be negative.

77
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,980
And I think you get the point, this is all well and good, but let's see how this is

78
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,660
actually useful in solving a problem.

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,400
A friend of mine recently asked me a pretty fun question about the infinite fraction 1

80
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,040
plus 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided by 1, and clearly you watch math

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,900
videos online, so maybe you've seen this before, but my friend's question actually

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,120
cuts to something you might not have thought about before, relevant to the view of derivatives

83
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,220
we're looking at here.

84
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,180
The typical way you might evaluate an expression like this is to set it equal to x, and then

85
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,640
notice that there is a copy of the full fraction inside itself.

86
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,780
So you can replace that copy with another x, and then just solve for x.

87
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,580
That is, what you want is to find a fixed point of the function 1 plus 1 divided by x.

88
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,720
But here's the thing, there are actually two solutions for x, two special numbers where

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,380
1 plus 1 divided by that number gives you back the same thing.

90
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:44,720
One is the golden ratio, phi, around 1.618, and the other is negative 0.618, which happens

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,540
to be negative 1 divided by phi.

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,080
I like to call this other number phi's little brother, since just about any property that

93
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,900
phi has, this number also has.

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,880
And this raises the question, would it be valid to say that the infinite fraction we

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,600
saw is somehow also equal to phi's little brother, negative 0.618?

96
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,560
Maybe you initially say, obviously not, everything on the left hand side is positive, so how

97
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,260
could it possibly equal a negative number?

98
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Well, first we should be clear about what we actually mean by an expression like this.

99
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,100
One way you could think about it, and it's not the only way, there's freedom for choice

100
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,760
here, is to imagine starting with some constant, like 1, and then repeatedly applying the function

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,260
1 plus 1 divided by x, and then asking, what is this approach as you keep going?

102
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,440
I mean, certainly symbolically what you get looks more and more like our infinite fraction,

103
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,980
so maybe if you wanted to equal a number, you should ask what this series of numbers

104
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,420
approaches.

105
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,900
And if that's your view of things, maybe you start off with a negative number, so it's

106
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,300
not so crazy for the whole expression to end up negative.

107
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,080
After all, if you start with negative 1 divided by phi, then applying this function 1 plus

108
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,340
1 over x, you get back the same number, negative 1 divided by phi, so no matter how many times

109
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,740
you apply it, you're staying fixed at this value.

110
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,420
But even then, there is one reason you should view phi as the favorite brother in this pair.

111
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,980
Here, try this, pull up a calculator of some kind, then start with any random number, and

112
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,440
plug it into this function, 1 plus 1 divided by x, and plug that number into 1 plus 1 over

113
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,040
x, and again, and again, and again, and again.

114
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,160
No matter what constant you start with, you eventually end up at 1.618.

115
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,940
Even if you start with a negative number, even one that's really close to phi's

116
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,400
little brother, eventually it shies away from that value and jumps back over to phi.

117
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,460
So, what's going on here?

118
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Why is one of these fixed points favored above the other one?

119
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,740
Maybe you can already see how the transformational understanding of derivatives is helpful for

120
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,420
understanding this setup, but for the sake of having a point of contrast, I want to show

121
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,080
you how a problem like this is often taught using graphs.

122
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,980
If you were to plug in some random input to this function, the y value tells you the corresponding

123
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,040
output, right?

124
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,360
So to think about plugging that output back into the function, you might first move horizontally

125
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,440
until you hit the line y equals x, and that's going to give you a position where the x value

126
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
corresponds to your previous y value, right?

127
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,240
So then from there, you can move vertically to see what output this new x value has, and

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,880
then you repeat.

129
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,640
You move horizontally to the line y equals x to find a point whose x value is the same

130
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,760
as the output you just got, and then you move vertically to apply the function again.

131
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,740
Now personally, I think this is kind of an awkward way to think about repeatedly applying

132
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,780
a function, don't you?

133
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,400
I mean, it makes sense, but you kind of have to pause and think about it to remember which

134
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,540
way to draw the lines.

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,100
And you can, if you want, think through what conditions make this spiderweb process narrow

136
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,280
in on a fixed point, versus propagating away from it.

137
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,900
In fact, go ahead, pause right now, and try to think it through as an exercise.

138
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,460
It has to do with slopes.

139
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,980
Or if you want to skip the exercise for something that I think gives a much more satisfying

140
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,620
understanding, think about how this function acts as a transformation.

141
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,740
So I'm going to go ahead and start here by drawing a bunch of arrows to indicate where

142
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
the various sampled input points will go.

143
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
And side note, don't you think this gives a neat emergent pattern?

144
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,020
I wasn't expecting this, but it was cool to see it pop up when animating.

145
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,660
I guess the action of 1 divided by x gives this nice emergent circle, and then we're

146
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,280
just shifting things over by 1.

147
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,280
Anyway, I want you to think about what it means to repeatedly apply some function, like

148
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,720
1 plus 1 over x, in this context.

149
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,020
Well after letting it map all of the inputs to the outputs, you could consider those as

150
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,600
the new inputs, and then just apply the same process again, and then again, and do it however

151
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,520
many times you want.

152
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,200
Notice, in animating this with a few dots representing the sample points, it doesn't

153
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,000
take many iterations at all before all of those dots kind of clump in around 1.618.

154
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,580
Now remember, we know that 1.618 and its little brother, negative 0.618 on and on, stay fixed

155
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,860
in place during each iteration of this process.

156
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,480
But zoom in on a neighborhood around phi.

157
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,900
During the map, points in that region get contracted around phi, meaning that the function

158
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,120
1 plus 1 over x has a derivative with a magnitude less than 1 at this input.

159
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,200
In fact, this derivative works out to be around negative 0.38.

160
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,920
So what that means is that each repeated application scrunches the neighborhood around this number

161
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,400
smaller and smaller, like a gravitational pull towards phi.

162
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,620
So now tell me what you think happens in the neighborhood of phi's little brother.

163
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,500
Over there, the derivative actually has a magnitude larger than 1, so points near the

164
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,920
fixed point are repelled away from it.

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,600
And when you work it out, you can see that they get stretched by more than a factor of

166
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
2 in each iteration.

167
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,240
They also get flipped around, because the derivative is negative here, but the salient

168
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,840
fact for the sake of stability is just the magnitude.

169
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
Mathematicians would call this right value a stable fixed point, and the left one is

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
an unstable fixed point.

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,700
Something is considered stable if when you perturb it just a little bit, it tends to

172
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,100
come back towards where it started, rather than going away from it.

173
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,180
So what we're seeing is a very useful little fact, that the stability of a fixed point

174
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,060
is determined by whether or not the magnitude of its derivative is bigger or smaller than

175
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,300
1.

176
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,820
This explains why phi always shows up in the numerical play, where you're just hitting

177
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,800
enter on your calculator over and over, but phi's little brother never does.

178
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,540
As to whether or not you want to consider phi's little brother a valid value of the

179
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,880
infinite fraction, well that's really up to you.

180
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,280
Everything we just showed suggests that if you think of this expression as representing

181
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,220
a limiting process, then because every possible seed value other than phi's little brother

182
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,160
gives you a series converging to phi, it does feel silly to put them on equal footing with

183
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,740
each other.

184
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,360
But maybe you don't think of it as a limit, maybe the kind of math you're doing lends

185
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,920
itself to treating this as a purely algebraic object, like the solutions of a polynomial,

186
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,220
which simply has multiple values.

187
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,400
Anyway, that's beside the point, and my point here is not that viewing derivatives

188
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,780
as this change in density is somehow better than the graphical intuition on the whole.

189
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,660
In fact, picturing an entire function this way can be kind of clunky and impractical

190
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,760
as compared to graphs.

191
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,760
My point is that it deserves more of a mention in most of the introductory calculus courses,

192
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,940
because it can help make a student's understanding of the derivative a little more flexible.

193
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,120
Like I mentioned, the real reason I'd recommend you carry this perspective with you as you

194
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,360
learn new topics is not so much for what it does with your understanding of single variable

195
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
calculus, it's for what comes after.
