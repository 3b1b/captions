1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
The months ahead of you hold within them a lot of hard work, some neat examples, some

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,160
not-so-neat examples, beautiful connections to physics, not-so-beautiful piles of formulas

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,440
to memorize, plenty of moments of getting stuck and banging your head into a wall, a

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,580
few nice aha moments sprinkled in as well, and some genuinely lovely graphical intuition

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,840
to help guide you through it all.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,880
But if the course ahead of you is anything like my first introduction to calculus, or

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,060
any of the first courses I've seen in the years since, there's one topic you will

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,300
not see, but which I believe stands to greatly accelerate your learning.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,080
You see, almost all of the visual intuitions from that first year are based on graphs.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,320
The derivative is the slope of a graph, the integral is a certain area under that graph.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
But as you generalize calculus beyond functions whose inputs and outputs are simply numbers,

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,580
it's not always possible to graph the function you're analyzing.

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,220
So if all your intuitions for the fundamental ideas, like derivatives, are rooted too rigidly

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,100
in graphs, it can make for a very tall and largely unnecessary conceptual hurdle between

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,620
you and the more quote-unquote advanced topics, like multivariable calculus and complex analysis,

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,040
differential geometry.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,260
What I want to share with you is a way to think about derivatives, which I'll refer

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,480
to as the transformational view that generalizes more seamlessly into some of those more general

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,020
contexts where calculus comes up.

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,600
And then we'll use this alternate view to analyze a fun puzzle about repeated fractions.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,900
But first off, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page about what the standard

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,160
visual is.

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,840
If you were to graph a function, which simply takes real numbers as inputs and outputs,

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,640
one of the first things you learn in a calculus course is that the derivative gives you the

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,140
slope of this graph, where what we mean by that is that the derivative of the function

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,540
is a new function which for every input x returns that slope.

27
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,740
Now I'd encourage you not to think of this derivative as slope idea as being the definition

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,240
of a derivative.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,100
Instead think of it as being more fundamentally about how sensitive the function is to tiny

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,060
little nudges around the input.

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,740
And the slope is just one way to think about that sensitivity relevant only to this particular

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,480
way of viewing functions.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,900
I have not just another video, but a full series on this topic if it's something you

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,100
want to learn more about.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,060
Now the basic idea behind the alternate visual for the derivative is to think of this function

36
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,580
as mapping all of the input points on the number line to their corresponding outputs

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,020
on a different number line.

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,340
In this context, what the derivative gives you is a measure of how much the input space

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,380
gets stretched or squished in various regions.

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,220
That is, if you were to zoom in around a specific input and take a look at some evenly spaced

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,560
points around it, the derivative of the function of that input will tell you how spread out

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,200
or contracted those points become after the mapping.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,840
Here, a specific example helps.

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Take the function x2, it maps 1 to 1, 2 to 4, 3 to 9, and so on.

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,960
You can also see how it acts on all of the points in between.

46
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,540
If you zoom in on a little cluster of points around the input 1, and see where they land

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,300
around the relevant output, you'd notice that they tend to get stretched out.

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,700
In fact, it roughly looks like stretching out by a factor of 2.

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,860
The closer you zoom in, the more this local behavior looks just like multiplying by a

50
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,500
factor of 2.

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,900
This is what it means for the derivative of x2 at the input x equals 1 to be 2.

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
It's what that fact looks like in the context of transformations.

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,780
If you looked at a neighborhood of points around the input 3, they would get stretched

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,800
out by a factor of 6.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,240
This is what it means for the derivative of this function at the input 3 to equal 6.

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,720
Around the input 1 fourth, a small region tends to get contracted by a factor of 1 half,

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,120
and that's what it looks like for a derivative to be smaller than 1.

58
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,300
The input 0 is interesting.

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,580
Zooming in by a factor of 10, it doesn't really look like a constant stretching or

60
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,580
squishing.

61
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,380
For one thing, all of the outputs end up on the right positive side of things.

62
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,060
As you zoom in closer and closer, by 100x, or by 1000x, it looks more and more like a

63
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,660
small neighborhood of points around 0 just gets collapsed into 0 itself.

64
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,500
This is what it looks like for the derivative to be 0.

65
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,720
The local behavior looks more and more like multiplying the whole number line by 0.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,040
It doesn't have to completely collapse everything to a point at a particular zoom level, instead

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,560
it's a matter of what the limiting behavior is as you zoom in closer and closer.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,120
It's also instructive to take a look at the negative inputs here.

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,360
Things start to feel a little cramped since they collide with where all the positive input

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,400
values go, and this is one of the downsides of thinking of functions as transformations.

71
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,540
But for derivatives, we only really care about the local behavior anyway, what happens in

72
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,260
a small range around a given input.

73
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,460
Here, notice that the inputs in a little neighborhood around, say, negative 2, they don't just

74
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,580
get stretched out, they also get flipped around.

75
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,900
Specifically, the action on such a neighborhood looks more and more like multiplying by negative

76
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,260
4 the closer you zoom in.

77
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,140
This is what it looks like for the derivative of a function to be negative.

78
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,720
I think you get the point, this is all well and good, but let's see how this is useful

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
in solving a problem.

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,520
A friend of mine recently asked me a pretty fun question about the infinite fraction 1

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,960
plus 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided by 1, and clearly you watch math

82
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,860
videos online, so maybe you've seen this before, but my friend's question actually

83
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,120
cuts to something you might not have thought about before, relevant to the view of derivatives

84
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
that we're looking at here.

85
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,100
The typical way you might evaluate an expression like this is to set it equal to x, and then

86
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,160
notice that there's a copy of the full fraction inside itself.

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,300
So you can replace that copy with another x, and then just solve for x.

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,080
That is, what you want is to find a fixed point of the function 1 plus 1 divided by

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,620
x.

90
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,920
But here's the thing, there are actually two solutions for x, two special numbers where

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,200
1 plus 1 divided by that number gives you back the same thing.

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,740
One is the golden ratio, phi, around 1.618, and the other is negative 0.618, which happens

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,940
to be negative 1 divided by phi.

94
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,000
I like to call this other number phi's little brother, since just about any property that

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,740
phi has, this number also has.

96
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,820
And this raises the question, would it be valid to say that the infinite fraction we

97
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:04,840
saw is somehow also equal to phi's little brother, negative 0.618?

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,460
Maybe you initially say, obviously not, everything on the left hand side is positive, so how

99
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,120
could it possibly equal a negative number?

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,980
Well, first we should be clear about what we actually mean by an expression like this.

101
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,040
One way you could think about it, and it's not the only way, there's freedom for choice

102
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,680
here, is to imagine starting with some constant, like 1, and then repeatedly applying the function

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,100
1 plus 1 divided by x, and then asking, what is this approach as you keep going?

104
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,900
I mean, certainly symbolically what you get looks more and more like our infinite fraction,

105
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,940
so maybe if you wanted to equal a number, you should ask what this series of numbers

106
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,340
approaches.

107
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,820
And if that's your view of things, maybe you start off with a negative number, so it's

108
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,220
not so crazy for the whole expression to end up negative.

109
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,240
After all, if you start with negative 1 divided by phi, then applying this function, 1 plus

110
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,400
1 over x, you get back the same number, negative 1 divided by phi.

111
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,980
So no matter how many times you apply it, you're staying fixed at this value.

112
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,620
But even then, there is one reason you should probably view phi as the favorite brother

113
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
in this pair.

114
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,960
Here, try this, pull up a calculator of some kind, then start with any random number, and

115
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,380
plug it into this function, 1 plus 1 divided by x, and plug that number into 1 plus 1 over

116
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,860
x, and again, and again, and again, and again.

117
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,080
No matter what constant you start with, you eventually end up at 1.618.

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,060
Even if you start with a negative number, even one that's really close to phi's little

119
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,300
brother, eventually it shies away from that value and jumps back over to phi.

120
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,840
So, what's going on here?

121
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,740
Why is one of these fixed points favored above the other one?

122
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,700
Maybe you can already see how the transformational understanding of derivatives is helpful for

123
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,360
understanding this setup, but for the sake of having a point of contrast, I want to show

124
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
you how a problem like this is often taught using graphs.

125
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,040
If you were to plug in some random input to this function, the y value tells you the corresponding

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,980
output, right?

127
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,060
So to plug that output back into the function, you might first move horizontally until you

128
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,480
hit the line y equals x, and that's going to give you a position where the x value corresponds

129
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,980
to your previous y value, right?

130
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,260
So then from there, you can move vertically to see what output this new x value has, and

131
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,560
then you repeat, you move horizontally to the line y equals x to find a point whose

132
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,860
x value is the same as the output you just got, and then you move vertically to apply

133
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,340
the function again.

134
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,380
Personally, I think this is an awkward way to think about repeatedly applying a function,

135
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
don't you?

136
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,780
I mean, it makes sense, but you have to pause and think about it to remember which way to

137
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
draw the lines.

138
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,100
And you can, if you want, think through what conditions make this spiderweb process narrow

139
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,460
in on a fixed point, versus propagating away from it.

140
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,460
In fact, go ahead, pause right now and try to think it through as an exercise.

141
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,380
It has to do with slopes.

142
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,020
Or if you want to skip the exercise for something that I think gives a much more satisfying

143
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,020
understanding, think about how this function acts as a transformation.

144
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,140
So I'm going to start here by drawing a bunch of arrows to indicate where the various

145
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,260
sampled input points will go.

146
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,860
And side note, don't you think this gives a neat emergent pattern?

147
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,820
I wasn't expecting this, but it was cool to see it pop up when animating.

148
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,220
The action of 1 divided by x gives this nice emergent circle, and then we're just shifting

149
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,500
things over by one.

150
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,220
Anyway, I want you to think about what it means to repeatedly apply some function, like

151
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,180
1 plus 1 over x, in this context.

152
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,940
Well, after letting it map all the inputs to the outputs, you could consider those as

153
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,620
the new inputs, and then just apply the same process again, and then again, and do it however

154
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,140
many times you want.

155
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,540
Notice in animating this with a few dots representing the sample points, it doesn't take many

156
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,660
iterations at all before all of those dots kind of clump in around 1.618.

157
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,580
Now remember, we know that 1.618 and its little brother, negative 0.618 on and on, stay fixed

158
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,940
in place during each iteration of this process.

159
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,500
But zoom in on a neighborhood around phi.

160
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,900
During the map, points in that region get contracted around phi, meaning that the function

161
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,940
1 plus 1 over x has a derivative with a magnitude less than 1 at this input.

162
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,180
In fact, this derivative works out to be around negative 0.38.

163
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,900
So what that means is that each repeated application scrunches the neighborhood around this number

164
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,340
smaller and smaller, like a gravitational pull towards phi.

165
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,420
So now, tell me what you think happens in the neighborhood of phi's little brother.

166
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,300
Over there, the derivative has a magnitude larger than 1, so points near the fixed point

167
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,660
are repelled away from it.

168
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,500
And when you work it out, you can see that they get stretched by more than a factor of

169
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,460
2 in each iteration.

170
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,740
They also get flipped around because the derivative is negative here, but the salient fact for

171
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,420
the sake of stability is just the magnitude.

172
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,940
Mathematicians would call this right value a stable fixed point, and the left one is

173
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,180
an unstable fixed point.

174
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,660
Everything is considered stable if when you perturb it just a little bit, it tends to

175
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,220
come back towards where it started, rather than going away from it.

176
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,540
So what we're seeing is a very useful little fact, that the stability of a fixed point

177
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,220
is determined by whether or not the magnitude of its derivative is bigger or smaller than

178
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
1.

179
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,800
This explains why phi always shows up in the numerical play, where you're just hitting

180
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,580
enter on your calculator over and over, but phi's little brother never does.

181
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,780
Whether or not you want to consider phi's little brother a valid value of the infinite

182
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,520
fraction is up to you.

183
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,280
Everything we just showed suggests that if you think of this expression as representing

184
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,340
a limiting process, then because every possible seed value other than phi's little brother

185
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,080
gives you a series converging to phi, it does feel silly to put them on equal footing with

186
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,420
each other.

187
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,340
But maybe you don't think of it as a limit, maybe the kind of math you're doing lends

188
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,380
itself to treating this as a purely algebraic object, like the solutions of a polynomial,

189
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,700
which simply has multiple values.

190
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,400
Anyway, that's beside the point, and my point here is not that viewing derivatives

191
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,620
as this change in density is somehow better than the graphical intuition on the whole.

192
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,680
In fact, picturing an entire function this way can be kind of clunky and impractical

193
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
as compared to graphs.

194
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,160
My point is that it deserves more of a mention in most of the introductory calculus courses,

195
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,000
because it can help make a student's understanding of the derivative a little more flexible.

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,040
Like I mentioned, the real reason I'd recommend you carry this perspective with you as you

197
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,320
learn new topics is not so much for what it does with your understanding of single variable

198
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,520
calculus, it's for what comes after.
