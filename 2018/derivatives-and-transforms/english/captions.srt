1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,853
The months ahead of you hold within them a lot of hard work, some neat examples, 

2
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:14,950
some not-so-neat examples, beautiful connections to physics, 

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,388
not-so-beautiful piles of formulas to memorize, 

4
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:20,943
plenty of moments of getting stuck and banging your head into a wall, 

5
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:24,548
a few nice aha moments sprinkled in as well, and some genuinely lovely 

6
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:27,240
graphical intuition to help guide you through it all.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,700
But if the course ahead of you is anything like my first introduction to calculus, 

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,544
or any of the first courses I've seen in the years since, 

9
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:38,713
there's one topic you will not see, but which I believe stands to greatly accelerate 

10
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:39,400
your learning.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,620
You see, almost all of the visual intuitions from that first year are based on graphs.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,660
The derivative is the slope of a graph, the integral is a certain area under that graph.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,035
But as you generalize calculus beyond functions whose inputs and outputs are 

14
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:58,020
simply numbers, it's not always possible to graph the function you're analyzing.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,653
So if all your intuitions for the fundamental ideas, like derivatives, 

16
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:08,794
are rooted too rigidly in graphs, it can make for a very tall and largely 

17
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:13,159
unnecessary conceptual hurdle between you and the more quote-unquote advanced 

18
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,580
topics like multivariable calculus and complex analysis, differential geometry.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,205
What I want to share with you is a way to think about derivatives, 

20
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:24,717
which I'll refer to as the transformational view, 

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,434
that generalizes more seamlessly into some of those more general contexts 

22
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:29,640
where calculus comes up.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,860
And then we'll use this alternate view to analyze a fun puzzle about repeated fractions.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,539
But first off, I just want to make sure we're all 

25
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,660
on the same page about what the standard visual is.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,937
If you were to graph a function, which simply takes real numbers as inputs and outputs, 

27
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:49,593
one of the first things you learn in a calculus course is that the derivative gives 

28
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:54,138
you the slope of this graph, where what we mean by that is that the derivative of 

29
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:58,240
the function is a new function which for every input x returns that slope.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,979
Now I'd encourage you not to think of this derivative 

31
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,440
as slope idea as being the definition of a derivative.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,555
Instead think of it as being more fundamentally about how 

33
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,419
sensitive the function is to tiny little nudges around the input.

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,058
And the slope is just one way to think about that sensitivity 

35
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:16,900
relevant only to this particular way of viewing functions.

36
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,816
I have not just another video, but a full series on this 

37
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:22,120
topic if it's something you want to learn more about.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,023
The basic idea behind the alternate visual for the derivative is to 

39
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:29,295
think of this function as mapping all of the input points on the 

40
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:32,820
number line to their corresponding outputs on a different number line.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,810
In this context, what the derivative gives you is a measure of how 

42
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,220
much the input space gets stretched or squished in various regions.

43
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,673
That is, if you were to zoom in around a specific input and take a look at some 

44
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:51,486
evenly spaced points around it, the derivative of the function of that input is 

45
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:56,600
going to tell you how spread out or contracted those points become after the mapping.

46
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,400
Here, a specific example helps.

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,920
Take the function x2, it maps 1 to 1, 2 to 4, 3 to 9, and so on.

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,220
You can also see how it acts on all of the points in between.

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,761
If you were to zoom in on a little cluster of points around the input 1, 

50
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:19,640
and see where they land around the relevant output, 

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,737
which for this function also happens to be 1, you'd notice that they tend 

52
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,900
to get stretched out.

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,020
In fact, it roughly looks like stretching out by a factor of 2.

54
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,629
The closer you zoom in, the more this local behavior looks just like multiplying 

55
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:41,820
by a This is what it means for the derivative of x2 at the input x equals 1 to be 2.

56
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,400
It's what that fact looks like in the context of transformations.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,732
If you looked at a neighborhood of points around the input 3, 

58
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:52,160
they would get stretched out by a factor of 6.

59
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,440
This is what it means for the derivative of this function at the input 3 to equal 6.

60
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,614
Around the input 1 fourth, a small region tends to get contracted specifically by a 

61
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:08,360
factor of 1 half, and that's what it looks like for a derivative to be smaller than 1.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
The input 0 is interesting.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,618
Zooming in by a factor of 10, it doesn't really 

64
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,959
look like a constant stretching or squishing.

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,680
For one thing, all of the outputs end up on the right positive side of things.

66
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,720
As you zoom in closer and closer, by 100x or by 1000x, 

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:39,960
it looks more and more like a And this is what it looks like for the derivative to be 0.

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,020
The local behavior looks more and more like multiplying the whole number line by 0.

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,783
It doesn't have to completely collapse everything to a point at a particular zoom level, 

70
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:53,840
instead it's a matter of what the limiting behavior is as you zoom in closer and closer.

71
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,960
It's also instructive to take a look at the negative inputs here.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,536
Things start to feel a little cramped since they collide with where all the positive 

73
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:08,057
input values go, and this is one of the downsides of thinking of functions as 

74
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,780
transformations.

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,094
But for derivatives, we only really care about the local behavior anyway, 

76
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,640
what happens in a small range around a given input.

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,189
Here, notice that the inputs in a little neighborhood around, say, 

78
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,100
negative 2, don't just get stretched out, they also get flipped around.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,132
Specifically, the action on such a neighborhood looks more 

80
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:31,820
and more like multiplying by negative 4 the closer you zoom in.

81
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
This is what it looks like for the derivative of a function to be negative.

82
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,952
And I think you get the point, this is all well and good, 

83
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,660
but let's see how this is actually useful in solving a problem.

84
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,305
A friend of mine recently asked me a pretty fun question about the infinite 

85
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:52,137
fraction 1 plus 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided by 1, 

86
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:56,182
and clearly you watch math videos online, so maybe you've seen this before, 

87
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:59,961
but my friend's question actually cuts to something you might not have 

88
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:04,220
thought about before, relevant to the view of derivatives we're looking at here.

89
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,661
The typical way you might evaluate an expression like this is to set it equal to x, 

90
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,640
and then notice that there is a copy of the full fraction inside itself.

91
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,780
So you can replace that copy with another x, and then just solve for x.

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,580
That is, what you want is to find a fixed point of the function 1 plus 1 divided by x.

93
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,970
But here's the thing, there are actually two solutions for x, 

94
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,380
two special numbers where 1 plus 1 divided by that number gives you back the same thing.

95
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,949
One is the golden ratio, phi, around 1.618, and the other is negative 0.618, 

96
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,540
which happens to be negative 1 divided by phi.

97
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,682
I like to call this other number phi's little brother, 

98
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:52,900
since just about any property that phi has, this number also has.

99
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,413
And this raises the question, would it be valid to say that the infinite 

100
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:03,600
fraction we saw is somehow also equal to phi's little brother, negative 0.618?

101
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,813
Maybe you initially say, obviously not, everything on the left hand side is positive, 

102
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:11,260
so how could it possibly equal a negative number?

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Well, first we should be clear about what we actually mean by an expression like this.

104
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,316
One way you could think about it, and it's not the only way, 

105
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:26,186
there's freedom for choice here, is to imagine starting with some constant, like 1, 

106
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:30,940
and then repeatedly applying the function 1 plus 1 divided by x, and then asking, 

107
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,260
what is this approach as you keep going?

108
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,552
I mean, certainly symbolically what you get looks more and more 

109
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:41,300
like our infinite fraction, so maybe if you wanted to equal a number, 

110
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,420
you should ask what this series of numbers approaches.

111
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,510
And if that's your view of things, maybe you start off with a negative number, 

112
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,300
so it's not so crazy for the whole expression to end up negative.

113
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,837
After all, if you start with negative 1 divided by phi, 

114
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:59,986
then applying this function 1 plus 1 over x, you get back the same number, 

115
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:03,803
negative 1 divided by phi, so no matter how many times you apply it, 

116
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:05,740
you're staying fixed at this value.

117
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,620
But even then, there is one reason you should 

118
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,420
view phi as the favorite brother in this pair.

119
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,331
Here, try this, pull up a calculator of some kind, then start with any random number, 

120
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:22,728
and plug it into this function, 1 plus 1 divided by x, 

121
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:28,040
and plug that number into 1 plus 1 over x, and again, and again, and again, and again.

122
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,159
No matter what constant you start with, you eventually end up at 1.618.

123
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,482
Even if you start with a negative number, even one that's really close to phi's 

124
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:43,400
little brother, eventually it shies away from that value and jumps back over to phi.

125
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,460
So, what's going on here?

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Why is one of these fixed points favored above the other one?

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,159
Maybe you can already see how the transformational understanding of derivatives 

128
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,984
is helpful for understanding this setup, but for the sake of having a point of contrast, 

129
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:07,080
I want to show you how a problem like this is often taught using graphs.

130
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,115
If you were to plug in some random input to this function, 

131
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:14,040
the y value tells you the corresponding output, right?

132
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,863
So to think about plugging that output back into the function, 

133
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:22,050
you might first move horizontally until you hit the line y equals x, 

134
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,783
and that's going to give you a position where the x value corresponds to your 

135
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,240
previous y value, right?

136
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,554
So then from there, you can move vertically to see what output this new x value has, 

137
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:35,880
and then you repeat.

138
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,598
You move horizontally to the line y equals x to find a point whose x value is the same 

139
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:44,760
as the output you just got, and then you move vertically to apply the function again.

140
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,286
Now personally, I think this is kind of an awkward way 

141
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:50,780
to think about repeatedly applying a function, don't you?

142
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,804
I mean, it makes sense, but you kind of have to pause 

143
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:56,540
and think about it to remember which way to draw the lines.

144
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,426
And you can, if you want, think through what conditions make this spiderweb 

145
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:05,280
process narrow in on a fixed point, versus propagating away from it.

146
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,900
In fact, go ahead, pause right now, and try to think it through as an exercise.

147
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,460
It has to do with slopes.

148
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,819
Or if you want to skip the exercise for something that I think gives a much more 

149
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:19,620
satisfying understanding, think about how this function acts as a transformation.

150
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,924
So I'm going to go ahead and start here by drawing a bunch of 

151
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,740
arrows to indicate where the various sampled input points will go.

152
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
And side note, don't you think this gives a neat emergent pattern?

153
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,020
I wasn't expecting this, but it was cool to see it pop up when animating.

154
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,797
I guess the action of 1 divided by x gives this nice emergent circle, 

155
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:41,280
and then we're just shifting things over by 1.

156
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,622
Anyway, I want you to think about what it means to repeatedly apply some function, 

157
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,720
like 1 plus 1 over x, in this context.

158
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,590
Well after letting it map all of the inputs to the outputs, 

159
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,504
you could consider those as the new inputs, and then just apply the same process again, 

160
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:01,520
and then again, and do it however many times you want.

161
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,729
Notice, in animating this with a few dots representing the sample points, 

162
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:11,775
it doesn't take many iterations at all before all of those dots kind of clump in around 1.

163
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:12,000
618.

164
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,355
Now remember, we know that 1.618 and its little brother, 

165
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:23,860
negative 0.618 on and on, stay fixed in place during each iteration of this process.

166
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,480
But zoom in on a neighborhood around phi.

167
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,788
During the map, points in that region get contracted around phi, 

168
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:39,404
meaning that the function 1 plus 1 over x has a derivative with a magnitude less 

169
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:41,120
than 1 at this input.

170
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,200
In fact, this derivative works out to be around negative 0.38.

171
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,312
So what that means is that each repeated application scrunches the neighborhood 

172
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:54,400
around this number smaller and smaller, like a gravitational pull towards phi.

173
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,620
So now tell me what you think happens in the neighborhood of phi's little brother.

174
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,426
Over there, the derivative actually has a magnitude larger than 1, 

175
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:08,920
so points near the fixed point are repelled away from it.

176
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,599
And when you work it out, you can see that they get 

177
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,800
stretched by more than a factor of 2 in each iteration.

178
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,675
They also get flipped around, because the derivative is negative here, 

179
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:20,840
but the salient fact for the sake of stability is just the magnitude.

180
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,970
Mathematicians would call this right value a stable fixed point, 

181
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,360
and the left one is an unstable fixed point.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,409
Something is considered stable if when you perturb it just a little bit, 

183
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,100
it tends to come back towards where it started, rather than going away from it.

184
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,778
So what we're seeing is a very useful little fact, 

185
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:45,312
that the stability of a fixed point is determined by whether or not the magnitude of its 

186
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:47,300
derivative is bigger or smaller than 1.

187
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,480
This explains why phi always shows up in the numerical play, 

188
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,922
where you're just hitting enter on your calculator over and over, 

189
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:55,800
but phi's little brother never does.

190
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,621
As to whether or not you want to consider phi's little brother a 

191
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:02,880
valid value of the infinite fraction, well that's really up to you.

192
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,970
Everything we just showed suggests that if you think of this expression 

193
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,525
as representing a limiting process, then because every possible seed 

194
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:14,442
value other than phi's little brother gives you a series converging to phi, 

195
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:17,740
it does feel silly to put them on equal footing with each other.

196
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,773
But maybe you don't think of it as a limit, maybe the kind of math 

197
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:25,601
you're doing lends itself to treating this as a purely algebraic object, 

198
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:29,220
like the solutions of a polynomial, which simply has multiple values.

199
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,485
Anyway, that's beside the point, and my point here is not that viewing derivatives 

200
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:38,780
as this change in density is somehow better than the graphical intuition on the whole.

201
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,204
In fact, picturing an entire function this way can be 

202
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,760
kind of clunky and impractical as compared to graphs.

203
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,222
My point is that it deserves more of a mention in most of the 

204
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:50,918
introductory calculus courses, because it can help make a 

205
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,940
student's understanding of the derivative a little more flexible.

206
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,358
Like I mentioned, the real reason I'd recommend you carry this perspective 

207
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:01,817
with you as you learn new topics is not so much for what it does with your 

208
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:05,000
understanding of single variable calculus, it's for what comes after.
