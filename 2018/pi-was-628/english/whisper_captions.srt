1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,540
I'm sure you're already familiar with the whole pi vs. tau debate.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,420
A lot of people say that the fundamental circle constant we hold up should be the ratio of

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,200
a circle's circumference to its radius, which is around 6.28, not the ratio to its

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,500
diameter, the more familiar 3.14.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,160
These days we often call that larger constant tau, popularized by Michael Hartle's tau

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,460
manifesto, although personally I'm quite partial to Robert Palace's proposed notation

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,880
of a pi with three legs.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,880
In either of these manifestos, and on many other places of the internet, you can read

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,800
to no end about how many formulas look a lot cleaner using tau, largely because the number

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,960
of radians describing a given fraction of a circle is actually that fraction of tau.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,340
That dead horse is beat, I'm not here to make that case further.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,420
Instead, I'd like to talk about the seminal moment in history when pi as we know it became

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,920
the standard.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,640
For this, one fruitful place to look is at the old notes and letters by one of history's

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,500
most influential mathematicians, Leonhard Euler.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,960
Luckily, we now have an official 3b1 brown Switzerland correspondent, Ben Hambrecht,

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,800
who was able to go to the library in Euler's hometown and get his hands on some of the

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,780
original documents.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,480
And in looking through some of those, it might surprise you to see Euler write,

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,580
Let pi be the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1,

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,840
that is, the 6.28 constant we would now call tau,

22
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,800
and it's likely he was using the Greek letter pi as a p for perimeter.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,480
So was it the case that Euler, genius of the day, was more notationally enlightened than

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,140
the rest of the world, fighting the good fight for 6.28?

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,620
And if so, who's the villain of our story, pushing the 3.1415 constant shoved in front

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,640
of most students today?

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,880
The work that really established pi as we now know it as the commonly recognized circle

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,060
constant was an early calculus book from 1748.

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,240
At the start of chapter 8, in describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,920
1, and after expanding out a full 128 digits of this number, one of them wrong, by the

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,080
way, the author adds, which for the sake of brevity I may write pi.

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,720
There were other texts and letters here and there with varying conventions for the notation

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,540
of various circle constants, but this book, and this section in particular, was really

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,000
the one to spread the notation throughout Europe, and eventually the world.

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,700
So what monster wrote this book with such an unprincipled take towards circle constants?

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
Well, Euler again.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,740
In fact, if you look further, you can find instances of Euler using the symbol pi to

38
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,000
represent a quarter turn of the circle, what we would call today pi halves, or tau fourths.

39
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,900
In fact, Euler's use of the letter pi seems to be much more analogous to our use of the

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,820
Greek letter theta.

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,300
It's typical for us to let it represent an angle, but no one angle in particular.

42
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,840
Sometimes it's 30 degrees, maybe other times it's 135, and most times it's just a variable

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
for a general statement.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,920
It depends on the problem and the context before us.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,100
Likewise, Euler let pi represent whatever circle constant best suited the problem before

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,920
him, though it's worth pointing out that he typically framed things in terms of unit

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,480
circles with radius one, so the 3.1415 constant would almost always have been thought of as

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,540
the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, none of this circumference

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,840
to its diameter nonsense.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,740
And I think Euler's use of this symbol carries with it a general lesson about how we should

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,400
approach math.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,000
The thing you have to understand about Euler is that this man solved problems, a lot of

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,420
problems.

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,640
I mean, day in, day out, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he was just churning out puzzles

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,240
and formulas and having insights and creating entire new fields, left and right.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,440
Over the course of his life, he wrote over 500 books and papers, which amounted to a

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,100
rate of 800 pages per year, and these are dense math pages.

58
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,840
And then after his death, another 400 publications surfaced.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,580
It's often joked that formulas and math have to be named after the second person to prove

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,940
them, because the first is always going to be Euler.

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,240
His mind was not focused on what circle constant we should take as fundamental, it was on solving

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,460
the task sitting in front of him in a particular moment, and writing a letter to the Bernoullis

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,900
to boast about doing so afterwards.

64
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,500
For some problems, the quarter circle constant was most natural to think about, for others

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,760
the full circle constant, and for others still, say at the start of chapter 8 of his famous

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,220
calculus book, maybe the half circle constant was most natural to think about.

67
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,560
Too often in math education, the focus is on which of multiple competing views about

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,000
a topic is right.

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,720
Is it correct to say that the sum of all positive integers is negative 1 12th, or is it correct

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,300
to say that it diverges to infinity?

71
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,180
Can the infinitesimal values of calculus be taken literally, or is it only correct to

72
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,160
speak in terms of limits?

73
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Are you allowed to divide a number by zero?

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,800
These questions in isolation just don't matter.

75
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,460
Our focus should be on specific problems and puzzles, both those of practical application

76
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,400
and those of idle pondering for knowledge's own sake.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,440
Then, when questions of standards arise, you can answer them with respect to a given context.

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,640
And inevitably, different contexts will lend themselves to different answers of what seems

79
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,320
most natural.

80
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,560
But that's okay.

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,200
Outputting 800 pages a year of dense transformative insights seems to be more correlated with

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,400
a flexibility towards conventions than it does with focusing on which standards are

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,460
objectively right.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,080
So on this Pi Day, the next time someone tells you that, you know, we should really be celebrating

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,580
math on June 28th, see how quickly you can change the topic to one where you're actually

86
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,980
talking about a piece of math.
