1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm sure you're already familiar with the whole pi vs.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,540
tau debate.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,489
A lot of people say that the fundamental circle constant we hold up 

4
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:14,666
should be the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius, 

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:18,500
which is around 6.28, not the ratio to its diameter, the more familiar 3.14.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,542
These days we often call that larger constant tau, 

7
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,904
popularized by Michael Hartle's tau manifesto, 

8
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:28,221
although personally I'm quite partial to Robert Palace's proposed 

9
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,880
notation of a pi with three legs.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,601
In either of these manifestos, and on many other places of the internet, 

11
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:38,844
you can read to no end about how many formulas look a lot cleaner using tau, 

12
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:43,802
largely because the number of radians describing a given fraction of a circle is actually 

13
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:44,960
that fraction of tau.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,340
That dead horse is beat, I'm not here to make that case further.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,320
Instead, I'd like to talk about the seminal moment 

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,920
in history when pi as we know it became the standard.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,985
For this, one fruitful place to look is at the old notes and letters 

18
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:01,500
by one of history's most influential mathematicians, Leonhard Euler.

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,774
Luckily, we now have an official 3b1 brown Switzerland correspondent, 

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,752
Ben Hambrecht, who was able to go to the library in Euler's 

21
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,780
hometown and get his hands on some of the original documents.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,161
And in looking through some of those, it might surprise you to see Euler write, 

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:22,582
Let pi be the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1, that is, 

24
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:28,239
the 6.28 constant we would now call tau, and it's likely he was using the Greek letter 

25
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,800
pi as a p for perimeter.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,828
So was it the case that Euler, genius of the day, 

27
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:36,642
was more notationally enlightened than the rest of the world, 

28
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,140
fighting the good fight for 6.28?

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,700
And if so, who's the villain of our story, pushing the 

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,640
3.1415 constant shoved in front of most students today?

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,487
The work that really established pi as we now know it as the commonly 

32
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:53,060
recognized circle constant was an early calculus book from 1748.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,632
At the start of chapter 8, in describing the semi-circumference of a circle with 

34
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:03,737
radius 1, and after expanding out a full 128 digits of this number, one of them wrong, 

35
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:08,080
by the way, the author adds, which for the sake of brevity I may write pi.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,961
There were other texts and letters here and there with varying conventions for the 

37
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:16,957
notation of various circle constants, but this book, and this section in particular, 

38
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:21,000
was really the one to spread the notation throughout Europe, and eventually the world.

39
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,700
So what monster wrote this book with such an unprincipled take towards circle constants?

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
Well, Euler again.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,284
In fact, if you look further, you can find instances of Euler using the symbol pi to 

42
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:37,222
represent a quarter turn of the circle, what we would call today pi halves, 

43
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,000
or tau fourths.

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,156
In fact, Euler's use of the letter pi seems to be much 

45
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:43,820
more analogous to our use of the Greek letter theta.

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,300
It's typical for us to let it represent an angle, but no one angle in particular.

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,780
Sometimes it's 30 degrees, maybe other times it's 135, 

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,880
and most times it's just a variable for a general statement.

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,920
It depends on the problem and the context before us.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,386
Likewise, Euler let pi represent whatever circle constant best suited the 

51
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:06,275
problem before him, though it's worth pointing out that he typically framed 

52
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,782
things in terms of unit circles with radius one, 

53
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:12,722
so the 3.1415 constant would almost always have been thought of as the ratio 

54
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:15,179
of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, 

55
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:17,840
none of this circumference to its diameter nonsense.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,199
And I think Euler's use of this symbol carries with 

57
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,400
it a general lesson about how we should approach math.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,384
The thing you have to understand about Euler is that this man solved problems, 

59
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,420
a lot of problems.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,235
I mean, day in, day out, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 

61
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:36,044
he was just churning out puzzles and formulas and having insights and creating entire 

62
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:37,240
new fields, left and right.

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,997
Over the course of his life, he wrote over 500 books and papers, 

64
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:47,100
which amounted to a rate of 800 pages per year, and these are dense math pages.

65
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,840
And then after his death, another 400 publications surfaced.

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,923
It's often joked that formulas and math have to be named after the second 

67
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,940
person to prove them, because the first is always going to be Euler.

68
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,211
His mind was not focused on what circle constant we should take as fundamental, 

69
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:05,578
it was on solving the task sitting in front of him in a particular moment, 

70
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,900
and writing a letter to the Bernoullis to boast about doing so afterwards.

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,147
For some problems, the quarter circle constant was most natural to think about, 

72
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,779
for others the full circle constant, and for others still, 

73
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,410
say at the start of chapter 8 of his famous calculus book, 

74
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,220
maybe the half circle constant was most natural to think about.

75
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,370
Too often in math education, the focus is on which 

76
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,000
of multiple competing views about a topic is right.

77
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,003
Is it correct to say that the sum of all positive integers is negative 1 12th, 

78
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,300
or is it correct to say that it diverges to infinity?

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,817
Can the infinitesimal values of calculus be taken literally, 

80
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:39,160
or is it only correct to speak in terms of limits?

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Are you allowed to divide a number by zero?

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,800
These questions in isolation just don't matter.

83
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,956
Our focus should be on specific problems and puzzles, 

84
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:52,400
both those of practical application and those of idle pondering for knowledge's own sake.

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,923
Then, when questions of standards arise, you can 

86
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:58,440
answer them with respect to a given context.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,883
And inevitably, different contexts will lend themselves 

88
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:04,320
to different answers of what seems most natural.

89
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,560
But that's okay.

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,759
Outputting 800 pages a year of dense transformative insights seems 

91
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,187
to be more correlated with a flexibility towards conventions than 

92
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,460
it does with focusing on which standards are objectively right.

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,953
So on this Pi Day, the next time someone tells you that, you know, 

94
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,232
we should really be celebrating math on June 28th, 

95
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:26,359
see how quickly you can change the topic to one where you're actually 

96
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,700
talking about a piece of math.
