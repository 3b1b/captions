1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sure you're already familiar with the whole pi vs. tau debate.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,400
A lot of people say that the fundamental circle constant we hold up should be the ratio of

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,160
a circle's circumference to its radius, which is around 6.28, not the ratio to its

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,140
diameter, the more familiar 3.14.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,280
These days we often call that larger constant tau, popularized by Michael Hartle's tau

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,600
manifesto, although personally I'm quite partial to Robert Palace's proposed notation

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,640
of a pi with three legs.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,840
In either of these manifestos, and on many other places of the internet, you can read

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,760
to no end about how many formulas look a lot cleaner using tau, largely because the number

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,760
of radians describing a given fraction of a circle is actually that fraction of tau.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,520
That dead horse is beat, I'm not here to make that case further.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,400
Instead, I'd like to talk about the seminal moment in history when pi as we know it became

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,820
the standard.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,620
For this, one fruitful place to look is at the old notes and letters by one of history's

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,100
most influential mathematicians, Leonhard Euler.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,180
Luckily, we now have an official 3b1 brown Switzerland correspondent, Ben Hambrecht, who

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,700
was able to go to the library in Euler's hometown and get his hands on some of the

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,020
original documents.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,740
And in looking through some of those, it might surprise you to see Euler write,

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,540
Let pi be the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1, that is, the 6.28 constant we

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,620
would now call tau, and it's likely he was using the Greek letter pi as a p for perimeter.

22
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,380
So was it the case that Euler, genius of the day, was more notationally enlightened than

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,860
the rest of the world, fighting the good fight for 6.28?

24
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,620
And if so, who's the villain of our story, pushing the 3.1415 constant shoved in front

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,000
of most students today?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,700
The work that established pi as we now know it as the commonly recognized circle constant

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,920
was an early calculus book from 1748.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,480
At the start of chapter 8, in describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,600
1, and after expanding out a full 128 digits of this number, one of them wrong by the way,

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,200
the author adds, which for the sake of brevity I may write pi.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,740
There were other texts and letters here and there with varying conventions for the notation

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,460
of various circle constants, but this book, and this section in particular, was really

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,980
the one to spread the notation throughout Europe, and eventually the world.

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,340
So what monster wrote this book with such an unprincipled take towards circle constants?

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,900
Well, Euler again.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,660
In fact, if you look further, you can find instances of Euler using the symbol pi to

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,500
represent a quarter turn of the circle, what we would call pi halves, or tau fourths.

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,780
In fact, Euler's use of the letter pi seems to be much more analogous to our use of the

39
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,900
Greek letter theta.

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,260
It's typical for us to let it represent an angle, but no one angle in particular.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,840
Sometimes it's 30 degrees, maybe other times it's 135, and most times it's just a variable

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,340
for a general statement.

43
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,260
It depends on the problem and the context before us.

44
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,060
Likewise, Euler let pi represent whatever circle constant best suited the problem before

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,060
him.

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,660
Though it's worth pointing out that he typically framed things in terms of unit circles, with

47
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,500
radius one, so the 3.1415 constant would almost always have been thought of as the

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,660
ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, none of this circumference to

49
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,120
its diameter nonsense.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,660
And I think Euler's use of this symbol carries with it a general lesson about how we should

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,980
approach math.

52
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,260
The thing you have to understand about Euler is that this man solved problems, a lot of

53
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,260
problems.

54
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,640
I mean, day in, day out, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he was just churning out puzzles

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,960
and formulas and having insights and creating entire new fields, left and right.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Over the course of his life, he wrote over 500 books and papers, which amounted to a

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,360
rate of 800 pages per year, and these are dense math pages.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
And then after his death, another 400 publications surfaced.

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
It's often joked that formulas and math have to be named after the second person to

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,760
prove them, because the first is always going to be Euler.

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,200
His mind was not focused on what circle constant we should take as fundamental, it was on solving

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,400
the task sitting in front of him in a particular moment, and writing a letter to the Bernoullis

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,680
to boast about doing so afterwards.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,640
For some problems, the quarter circle constant was most natural to think about, for others

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,700
the full circle constant, and for others still, say at the start of chapter 8 of his famous

66
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,800
calculus book, maybe the half circle constant was most natural to think about.

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,520
Too often in math education, the focus is on which of multiple competing views about

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,700
a topic is right.

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,720
Is it correct to say that the sum of all positive integers is negative 1 twelfth, or is it correct

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,040
to say that it diverges to infinity?

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Can the infinitesimal values of calculus be taken literally, or is it only correct to

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,720
speak in terms of limits?

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,120
Are you allowed to divide a number by zero?

74
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,300
These questions in isolation just don't matter.

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,880
Our focus should be on specific problems and puzzles, both those of practical application

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,440
and those of idle pondering for knowledge's own sake.

77
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,240
Then when questions of standards arise, you can answer them with respect to a given context.

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,600
Inevitably, different contexts will lend themselves to different answers of what seems

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,300
most natural, but that's okay.

80
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,120
Outputting 800 pages a year of dense transformative insights seems to be more correlated with

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
a flexibility towards conventions than it does with focusing on which standards are

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
objectively right.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,060
So in this pi day, the next time someone tells you that, you know, we should really be celebrating

84
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,560
math on June 28th, see how quickly you can change the topic to one where you're actually

85
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,760
talking about a piece of math.
