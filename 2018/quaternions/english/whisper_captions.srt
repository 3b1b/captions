1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
What you're looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, or rather

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,500
you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion happening on a four-dimensional

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,160
sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space, one which you'll understand by the

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,280
end of this video.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,280
Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and often underappreciated number system from

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,640
math.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,840
Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers, quaternions

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,860
are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,600
But they're not just playful mathematical shenanigans, they have a surprisingly pragmatic

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,960
utility for describing rotation in three dimensions, and even for quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,780
The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,600
The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life seeking a three-dimensional

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
number system, analogous to the complex numbers.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,520
And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning whether or not he had figured

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,700
out how to divide triples, and he would always say no, not yet.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,020
But on October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin, he realized, with

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,900
a supposed flash of insight, that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,900
the complex numbers, but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions describing

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,460
space and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in some kind of fourth dimension.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,940
He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge,

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,480
which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,600
Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their dot product and the

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,800
cross product and things like that didn't really exist in Hamilton's time, at least

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,260
not in a standardized form.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,880
So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary language with

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,420
which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space, even forming an official quaternion

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,580
society to proselytize his discovery.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,940
Unfortunately, this was balanced with mathematicians on the other side of the fence, who believed

29
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,160
that the confusing notion of quaternion multiplication was not necessary for describing three dimensions,

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,100
resulting in some truly hilarious old-timey trash talk legitimately calling them evil.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,540
It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland, whose author you

32
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,160
may know was an Oxford mathematician, was written in reference to quaternions, that

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,320
the chaotic table placement changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,800
quotes were referencing their non-commutative nature.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,500
Fast forward about a century, and the computing industry gave quaternions a resurgence among

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,400
programmers who work with graphics and robotics and anything involving orientation in 3D space.

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,280
And this is because they give an elegant way to describe and compute 3D rotations, which

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,440
is computationally more efficient than other methods, and which also avoids a lot of the

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,720
numerical errors that arise in these other methods.

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,100
The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love from a completely different

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,600
direction, quantum mechanics.

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,040
The special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are actually quite relevant

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,460
to the way that two-state systems like spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,000
are described mathematically.

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,760
What I'll show you here is a way to visualize quaternions in their full four-dimensional

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,240
glory.

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,500
It would surprise me if this approach was fully original, but I can say that it's

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,460
certainly not the standard way to teach quaternions, and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,360
rule image I'd like to build up to is something I haven't seen elsewhere.

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time, but once you

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,280
have it, there is a very natural and satisfying intuition for how to think about quaternion

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,940
multiplication.

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,380
It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions describe

54
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,240
orientation in three dimensions, which is for some people the whole reason we care about

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,900
it, but once we're able to go at it armed with the image of what they're doing to

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,140
a 4D hypersphere, there's a pleasing understanding to be had for the otherwise opaque formulas

57
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,740
characterizing this relationship.

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,000
The structure here will be to start by imagining teaching complex numbers to someone who only

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,700
understands one dimension, then describing 3D rotations to someone who only understands

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,640
two dimensions, and ultimately to represent what quaternions are doing up in four dimensions

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,120
within the constraints of our 3D space.

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,080
Our first character is Linus the Linelander, whose mind can only grasp the one-dimensional

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,760
geometry of lines and the algebra of real numbers.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,160
We're going to try to describe complex numbers to Linus, and it's really important for

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,220
you to empathize with him as much as you can during this, because in a few minutes you're

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,080
going to be in his shoes.

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,180
On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically.

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,940
You say each one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i,

69
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,140
where i is a newly invented constant whose defining property is that i times i equals

70
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,860
negative one.

71
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,680
Then you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers, you just use the distributive property,

72
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,480
what many people learn in school as FOIL, and you apply this rule that i times i equals

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,720
negative one to simplify things down further.

74
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,300
And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard textbook way to introduce quaternions

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,780
is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling it done.

76
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,340
But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the geometry of

77
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,860
complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like, since the problems in math and

78
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,440
physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often leverage this spatial intuition.

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,180
You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.

80
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,000
When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w, you can think of z as a sort of function

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,300
acting on w, rotating and stretching it in some way.

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,720
I like to think of this by broadening the view and asking, what does z do to the entire

83
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,080
plane?

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,760
You can think of that bird's eye view action by imagining using one hand to fix the number

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,440
zero in place, and using another hand to drag the point at one up to z, since anything times

86
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
zero is zero, and anything times one is itself.

87
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,420
In two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching rotating action on the plane that'll

88
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,940
do this.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,100
This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion multiplication later on,

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,380
where the number on the left acts as a kind of function to the one on the right, and we'll

91
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,040
understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming space, although instead

92
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,520
of rotating 2d space, it does a sort of double rotation in 4d space.

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,760
By the way, if you want to review thinking about complex numbers as a kind of action,

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,760
a good warmup for this video might be the one I did on e to the pi i explained with

95
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,900
introductory group theory.

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,560
Now Linus the line lander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching, that's what

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
multiplication by real numbers looks like.

98
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,340
Maybe it's a little weird for him to think about stretching in multiple dimensions, but

99
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,920
it's not fundamentally different.

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,500
The difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation.

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,840
Specifically, focus on the unit circle of the complex plane, all the numbers a distance

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
1 from 0.

103
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,160
Since multiplication by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation, how would you explain to

104
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,580
Linus the look and feel of multiplying by these numbers?

105
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,660
At first, that might seem impossible, rotation is just such an intrinsically two-dimensional

106
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,380
idea.

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,280
But, on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom, a single number,

108
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,460
the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.

109
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,980
So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all rotations to the

110
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,680
one-dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,960
And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you is called

112
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,160
a stereographic projection, it's a special way to map a circle onto a line, or a sphere

113
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,060
into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.

114
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,120
For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative 1 through that point,

115
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,620
and wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle's center, that's where

116
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,540
the point of the circle gets projected.

117
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,520
So for example, the point at 1 gets projected into the center of the line, the point i actually

118
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,940
stays fixed in place, as does negative i.

119
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:16,400
All of the points on that 90 degree arc between 1 and i will get projected somewhere in the

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
interval between where 1 landed and where i landed.

121
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,320
As you continue farther around the circle on the arc between i and negative 1, the projected

122
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,420
points end up farther and farther away at an increasing rate.

123
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,280
Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative 1, the projected points end

124
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,660
up farther and farther on the other end of the line.

125
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,400
This line of projected points is what we show to Linus, labeling a few key points, like

126
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,140
1 and i and negative 1 all for reference.

127
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,300
Technically, the point at negative 1 has no projection under this map, since the tangent

128
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,240
line to the circle at that point never crosses the vertical line.

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,820
But what we say is that negative 1 ends up at the point at infinity, a special point

130
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,180
you imagine adding to the line where you would approach it if you walk infinitely far along

131
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,540
the line in either direction.

132
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,500
It's important to remember, and remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only the complex

133
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,580
numbers that are a distance 1 from the origin, the unit circle.

134
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,160
Linus doesn't see most numbers, like 0, or 1 plus i, or negative 2 minus i, but that's

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,600
okay, because right now we just want to describe complex numbers z where multiplying by z has

136
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,780
the effect of a pure rotation, so he only needs to understand the unit circle.

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,000
For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w,

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,080
the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, and when we apply this action to the circle

139
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
being projected down to the line for Linus, what does he see?

140
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,700
Well, it's a bit of a strange morphing action on the line, one which I want you to become

141
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,920
familiar with for something we'll see later on.

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,480
It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points.

143
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,780
i times 1 is i, so that means the number 1 should move up to i.

144
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,140
i times i is negative 1, so the point at i slides off to infinity.

145
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,420
i times negative 1 is equal to negative i, so that point at infinity kind of comes back

146
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,520
around from the bottom to the position 1 unit below the center.

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,460
i times negative i is 1, so the point at negative i slides up to 1.

148
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,940
Even though this is kind of a weird motion, it lets us communicate some important ideas

149
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,540
to Linus.

150
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,860
For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating by 90 degrees

151
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,400
four times in a row, gets us back to where we started.

152
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,520
i to the fourth equals 1.

153
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,380
To get more of a feel for things, let me just show the circle rotated at various different

154
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,780
angles.

155
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,840
On both the left and right half of the screen, I'm putting a hand on the point that started

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,660
at the number 1 to help us and help Linus keep track of the overall motion.

157
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,220
Next, let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.

158
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,160
Imagine trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.

159
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,080
In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions, let's extend the

160
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,540
complex numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and its vertical axis of imaginary

161
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,220
numbers with a third axis, defined by some newly invented constant, j, sitting one unit

162
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,000
away from zero, perpendicular to the complex plane.

163
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,360
Instead of having this new axis in the z-direction, like you might expect, for a better analogy

164
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,320
with how we'll visualize quaternions, we'll want to orient things so that the i and j

165
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,580
axes sit in the x and y directions, with the real number line aligned along the z-direction.

166
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,920
Every point in 3D space is described as some real number plus some real number times i

167
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,860
plus some real number times j.

168
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,980
As it happens, it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication for a 3D number

169
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,360
system like this that would satisfy the usual algebraic properties that make multiplication

170
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,440
a useful construct.

171
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,680
Perhaps I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video, but staying focused

172
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,940
on our current goal, think about describing 3D rotations in this coordinate system to

173
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,980
Felix the Flatlander.

174
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,500
The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance 1 from 0 at the origin,

175
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,780
meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is 1.

176
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,360
We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is project this 2D surface

177
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,260
to him and give him a feel for what reorientations of the sphere look like under that projection.

178
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,880
Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will associate almost every point

179
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,960
on the unit sphere with a unique point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and

180
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,720
the j axes.

181
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,200
For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative 1 at the south pole through

182
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,640
that point and see where it intersects the plane.

183
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,520
So the point 1 at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane.

184
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,520
All of the points of the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere inside the unit circle

185
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,720
of the i-j plane, and that unit circle which passes through i,j,-i,-j actually stays fixed

186
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,240
in place.

187
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,940
And that's an important point to make note of.

188
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,700
Even though most points and lines and patches that Felix the Flatlander sees are warped

189
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,080
projections of the real sphere, this unit circle is the one thing he has which is an

190
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,200
honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered by projection.

191
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,840
All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit circle, each

192
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,660
getting farther and farther away as you approach negative 1 at the south pole.

193
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,140
And again, negative 1 has no projection under this mapping, but what we say is that it ends

194
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,820
up at some point at infinity.

195
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,380
That point at infinity is something such that no matter which direction you walk on the

196
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,860
plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching that point.

197
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,600
It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole, you're approaching

198
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,500
the south pole.

199
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,200
Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions.

200
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,260
As I rotate the sphere in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on that

201
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,440
sphere get projected into various circles and lines in Felix's space.

202
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,020
And the way I've done things up here, the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the

203
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,840
sphere is accurately reflected in the projected view you see with Felix, and the pinker view

204
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,260
represents where the point that started at the north pole ends up after the rotation,

205
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,000
and the yellow circle represents where the equator ended up after the projection.

206
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,840
The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes right now, the easier quaternions will be

207
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,320
in a moment, and as with Linus, it helps to focus on a few key reference objects rather

208
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,760
than trying to see the whole sphere.

209
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,020
This circle, passing through 1, i, negative 1, and negative i, gets mapped onto a line

210
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,820
which Felix sees as the horizontal axis.

211
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,480
It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the same thing as the i-axis.

212
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,060
Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance 1 from the origin, so

213
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:27,520
most points on the actual i-axis, like 0, 2i, 3i, etc., are completely invisible to

214
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:27,880
Felix.

215
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,840
Similarly, the circle that passes through 1, j, negative 1, and negative j gets projected

216
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,860
onto what he sees as a vertical line.

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,480
In general, any line Felix sees comes from some circle on the sphere that passes through

218
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,100
negative 1.

219
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,820
In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the point at infinity.

220
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere.

221
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,340
A 90 degree rotation about the j-axis brings 1 to i, i to negative 1, negative 1 to negative

222
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,320
i, and negative i to 1.

223
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,320
So what Felix the Flatlander sees is an extension of the rotation that Linus the Linelander

224
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,060
was seeing.

225
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,340
Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where the 1,

226
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,140
j unit circle used to be.

227
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,380
So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed into a vertical line,

228
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,260
while the red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.

229
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion, no actual stretching

230
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,940
or morphing is taking place.

231
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,580
All of that is just an artifact of the projection.

232
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,780
Similarly, a rotation about the i-axis involves moving 1 to j, j to negative 1, negative 1

233
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,820
to negative j, and negative j to 1.

234
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,660
This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the 1, i unit circle, which to Felix looks

235
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,660
like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.

236
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,940
A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand, since

237
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,940
the whole projection simply gets rotated about the origin, where the only points staying

238
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,960
fixed in place are 1 at the origin and negative 1 off at infinity.

239
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,660
In the same way that the complex numbers included the real numbers with a single extra quote

240
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,240
unquote imaginary dimension, represented by the unit i, and that the not-actually-a-number

241
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,160
system thing we had in three dimensions included a second imaginary direction, j, the quaternions

242
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,720
include the real numbers together with three separate imaginary dimensions, represented

243
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,960
by the units i, j, and k.

244
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,240
Each of these three imaginary dimensions is perpendicular to the real number line, and

245
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,100
they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.

246
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,680
So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers, each

247
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,840
quaternion can be written using four real numbers, and it lives in four-dimensional

248
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,380
space.

249
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,560
You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part, and then a 3D

250
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,480
imaginary part.

251
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,960
And Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i, j, k components,

252
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,820
a word which was previously somewhat foreign in the lingo of math and physics, vector.

253
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,640
On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules for how

254
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,140
i, j, and k multiply together, and saying that everything must distribute nicely.

255
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,820
This is analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i times i is negative 1, and

256
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,700
then distributing and simplifying products.

257
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,880
And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform quaternion multiplication, and

258
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,800
the relative compactness of this operation compared to say matrix multiplication is what's

259
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,180
made quaternion so useful for graphics programming and many other things.

260
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,520
There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written in terms of the

261
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,120
dot product and the cross product, and in some sense, quaternion multiplication subsumes

262
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,340
both of these notions, at least as they appear in three dimensions.

263
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,620
But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding its

264
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,240
geometry that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and rotating,

265
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,360
you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion multiplication.

266
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,500
And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero, is the square root

267
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,780
of the sum of the squares of its component, that same operation gives you the magnitude

268
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,840
of a quaternion.

269
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,620
And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2, has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude

270
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,160
of q1, followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions.

271
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,480
And those special 4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand, correspond

272
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,680
to the hypersphere of quaternions, a distance 1 from the origin, both in the sense that

273
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,920
the quaternions whose multiplying action is a pure rotation live on that hypersphere,

274
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,600
and in the sense that we can understand this weird 4D action just by following points on

275
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,060
the hypersphere, rather than trying to look at all the points in the inconceivable stretches

276
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,700
of four-dimensional space.

277
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,000
Analogous to what we did for Linus and Felix, we stereographically project this hypersphere

278
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,460
into 3D space.

279
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,300
This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion, and this little

280
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,880
pink dot will show where that quaternion gets projected in our 3D space.

281
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,680
Just as before, we're projecting from the number negative 1, which sits on the real

282
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,640
number line that is somehow perpendicular to all of our 3D space, and beyond our perception.

283
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,040
Just as before, the number 1 ends up projected straight into the center of our space.

284
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:02,280
And in the same way that i and negative i were fixed in place for Linus, and that the

285
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,940
3D space and 3D space get a whole sphere passing through i, j, and k on that unit hypersphere

286
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,180
which stays in place under the projection.

287
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,280
So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only unaltered part of

288
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,580
the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us.

289
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,480
It's something analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere, and it represents all of the

290
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,320
unit quaternions whose real part is zero, what Hamilton would have described as unit

291
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,880
vectors.

292
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,720
The unit quaternions with positive real parts, between 0 and 1, end up somewhere inside this

293
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,220
unit sphere, closer to the number 1 in our 3D space, which should feel analogous to how

294
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,620
the northern hemisphere got mapped inside the unit circle for Felix.

295
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,900
On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with negative real part end up somewhere outside

296
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,780
that unit sphere.

297
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,460
The number negative 1 is sitting off at the point at infinity, which you can easily find

298
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,760
by walking in any direction.

299
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,040
Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions as being closer

300
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,280
or farther from the origin of our 3D space, everything you're looking at represents

301
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,560
a unit quaternion, so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude,

302
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,760
the same distance from the number 0.

303
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,740
And that number 0 itself is nowhere to be found in this picture.

304
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,580
Like all other non-unit quaternions, it's invisible to us.

305
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,040
In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through 1, i, negative 1, and negative

306
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:42,900
i got projected into a line through the origin, when we see this line through the origin passing

307
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,060
through i and negative i, we should understand that it really represents a circle.

308
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,960
Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us, there is a unit sphere passing through

309
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,400
1, i, j, negative 1, negative i, and negative j, and that whole sphere gets projected into

310
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,920
the plane that we see passing through 1, i, negative i, j, negative j, and negative 1,

311
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,840
off at infinity, what you and I might call the xy plane.

312
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,900
In general, any plane that you see here really represents the projection of a sphere somewhere

313
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,880
up on the hypersphere which passes through the number negative 1.

314
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,660
The action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion from

315
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,880
the left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2D rotations, happening perpendicular

316
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,660
to and in sync with each other in a way that could only ever be possible in four dimensions.

317
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,040
As a first example, let's look at multiplication by i.

318
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,340
We already know what this does to the circle that passes through 1 and i, which we see

319
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:43,980
as a line.

320
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,580
1 goes to i, i goes to negative 1, off at infinity, negative 1 comes back around to

321
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,000
negative i, and negative i goes to 1.

322
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,120
Remember, just like what Linus saw, all of this is the stereographic projection of a

323
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,260
90 degree rotation.

324
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,200
Now look at the circle passing through j and k, which is in a sense perpendicular to the

325
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,720
circle passing through 1 and i.

326
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,480
It might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular to each other, especially

327
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,120
when they have the same center and radius and don't touch each other at all, but nothing

328
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,800
could be more natural in four dimensions.

329
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,960
You can think of the action of i on this perpendicular circle as obeying a certain right-hand rule,

330
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,760
if you'll excuse the intrusion of my ghostly green-screen hand into our otherwise pristine

331
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,320
platonic mathematical stage.

332
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,420
You let that thumb of your right hand point from the number 1 to i, and you curl your

333
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,880
fingers.

334
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,020
The j-k circle will rotate in the direction of that curl.

335
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,120
How much?

336
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,020
Well, by the same amount as the 1i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case.

337
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,480
This is what I meant by two rotations perpendicular to and in sync with each other.

338
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:08,120
So j goes to k, k goes to negative j, negative j goes to negative k, and negative k goes

339
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,700
to j.

340
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,620
This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions, but

341
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,440
I want this not to be something you memorize, but something you could close your eyes and

342
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,340
you could really see.

343
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:27,160
Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers 1, i, j, and k, you know

344
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,680
what it does to any arbitrary quaternion, since multiplication distributes nicely.

345
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,120
In the language of linear algebra, 1, i, j, and k form a basis of our 4-dimensional space,

346
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,060
so knowing what our transformation does to them gives us the full information about what

347
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,240
it does to all of space.

348
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,440
Geometrically, a 4-dimensional creature would be able to look at those two perpendicular

349
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,880
rotations I just described, and understand that they lock you into one and only one rigid

350
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,140
motion for the hypersphere.

351
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,220
We might lack the intuitions of such a hypothetical creature, but we can maybe try to get close.

352
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,160
Here's what the action of repeatedly multiplying by i looks like on our stereographic projection

353
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,740
of the ijk sphere.

354
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,280
It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it

355
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,680
used to be, though the orientation is reversed now, then gets rotated again into what we

356
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,840
see as a plane, and after the fourth iteration, it ends up right back where it started.

357
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,800
As another example, think of a quaternion like q equals negative square root of 2 over

358
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,140
2 plus square root of 2 over 2 times i, which if we pull up a picture of a complex plane,

359
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,480
is a 135 degree rotation away from 1 in the direction of i.

360
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:46,260
Under our projection, we see this along the line from 1 to i somewhere outside the unit

361
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,540
sphere.

362
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,680
If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.

363
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,840
The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us like dragging

364
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,840
the point at 1 all the way to this projected version of q, while the jk circle gets rotated

365
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,300
135 degrees, according to our right-hand rule.

366
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,220
Multiplication by any other quaternion is completely similar.

367
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,840
For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act on other quaternions by multiplication

368
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,560
from the left.

369
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,200
The circle through 1 and j, which we see projected as a line through the origin, gets rotated

370
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,000
90 degrees, dragging 1 up to j, so j times 1 is 1 and j times j is negative 1.

371
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,680
The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k, gets rotated 90 degrees according

372
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,520
to this right-hand rule, where you point your thumb from 1 to j, so j times i is negative

373
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,600
k, and j times k is i.

374
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,920
In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space, start by drawing

375
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,020
the unit circle passing through 1, q, and negative 1, which we see in our projection

376
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,520
as a line through the origin.

377
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,100
Then draw the circle perpendicular to that 1 on what we see as the unit sphere.

378
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,180
You rotate the first circle so that 1 ends up where q was, and rotate the perpendicular

379
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,660
circle by the same amount according to the right-hand rule.

380
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,680
One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters.

381
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,700
It's not, as mathematicians would say, commutative.

382
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,520
For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of i acting on the quaternion

383
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:00,740
j, but if you think of j as acting on i, j times i, it rotates i to negative k.

384
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,480
In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication, is a way more

385
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,440
special property than a lot of people realize.

386
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,360
And most groups of actions on some space don't have it.

387
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,000
It's like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot, or how rotating a cube

388
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,940
about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives a different final state from rotating

389
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,660
it about the x-axis, then about the z-axis.

390
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,580
And last, as one final but rather important point, so far I've shown you how to think

391
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,860
about quaternions as acting by left multiplication, where when you read an expression like i times

392
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,340
j, you think of i as a kind of function morphing all of space, and j as one of the points it's

393
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,960
acting on.

394
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,760
But you can also think of them as a different sort of action, by multiplying from the right,

395
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,000
where in this expression, j would be acting on i.

396
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,420
In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar.

397
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,860
It's still the case that 1 goes to j, and j goes to negative 1, etc., but instead of

398
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,500
applying the right-hand rule to the circle perpendicular to the 1j circle, you would

399
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,520
use your left hand.

400
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,900
So either way, i times j is equal to k, but you can either think about this with your

401
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:19,000
right hand curling the number j to the number k as your thumb points from 1 to i, or as

402
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,080
your left hand curling i to k as its thumb points from 1 to j.

403
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,120
Understanding this left-hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be extremely useful

404
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,500
for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three dimensions.

405
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,700
And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3D rotation.

406
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,620
I mean, if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i, j, and k,

407
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,980
it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position.

408
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,420
So the way that this works is slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product.

409
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,000
It involves a process called conjugation, and I'll make a full follow-on video all

410
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,580
about it so that we have the time to go through some examples.

411
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,000
In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation to

412
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,220
orientation in 3D space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you are familiar

413
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,420
with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video.

414
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,540
Link in the description.

415
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,200
If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it with some friends, and if you felt like the narrative

416
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,100
structure here was actually helpful for understanding, maybe reassure those friends who would be

417
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,760
turned off by a large timestamp that good math is actually worth the time.

418
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,480
And many thanks to the patrons among you.

419
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,840
I actually spent way longer than I care to admit on this project, so your patience and

420
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,540
support is especially appreciated this time around.
