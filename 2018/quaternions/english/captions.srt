1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
What you're looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, or rather

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,580
you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion happening on a four-dimensional

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,080
sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space, one which you'll understand by the

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,040
end of this video.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,360
Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and often underappreciated number system from

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,000
math. Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers, quaternions

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,160
are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers. But they're not just playful mathematical

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,720
shenanigans, they have a surprisingly pragmatic utility for describing rotation in three dimensions,

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,140
and even for quantum mechanics.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,600
The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math. The Irish mathematician William

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,040
Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life seeking a three-dimensional number system, analogous

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,480
to the complex numbers. And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,400
whether or not he had figured out how to divide triples, and he would always say no, not yet.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,040
But on October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin, he realized with a

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,400
supposed flash of insight that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to the complex

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,860
numbers, but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions describing space,

17
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,140
and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in some kind of fourth dimension.

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,420
He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge,

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,300
which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,540
Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their dot product and the

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,940
cross product and things like that didn't really exist in Hamilton's time, at least

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,160
not in a standardized form. So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,240
language with which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space, even forming

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,160
an official quaternion society to proselytize his discovery. Unfortunately, this was balanced

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,120
with mathematicians on the other side of the fence, who believed that the confusing notion

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,880
of quaternion multiplication was not necessary for describing three dimensions, resulting

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,440
in some truly hilarious old-timey trash talk legitimately calling them evil.

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,480
It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland, whose author you

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,160
may know was an Oxford mathematician, was written in reference to quaternions, that

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,680
the chaotic table placement changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain quotes

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,080
were referencing their non-commutative nature. Fast forward about a century, and the computing

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,620
industry gave quaternions a resurgence among programmers who work with graphics and robotics

33
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,800
and anything involving orientation in 3D space. And this is because they give an elegant way

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,560
to describe and compute 3D rotations which is computationally more efficient than other

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,200
methods, and which also avoids a lot of the numerical errors that arise in these other

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,200
methods. The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love from a completely different

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,720
direction, quantum mechanics. You see, the special actions that quaternions describe

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,220
in four dimensions are actually quite relevant to the way that two-state systems like spin

39
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,680
of an electron or the polarization of a photon are described mathematically.

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,880
What I'll show you here is a way to visualize quaternions in their full four-dimensional

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,600
glory. It would surprise me if this approach was fully original, but I can say that it's

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,480
certainly not the standard way to teach quaternions, and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,080
rule image that I'd like to build up to is something that I haven't seen elsewhere.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time, but once you

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,320
have it, there is a very natural and satisfying intuition for how to think about quaternion

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,960
multiplication. It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,660
describe orientation in three dimensions, which is for some people the whole reason

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,560
we care about it, but once we're able to go at it armed with the image of what they're

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,100
doing to a 4D hypersphere, there's a pleasing understanding to be had for the otherwise

50
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,480
opaque formulas characterizing this relationship. The structure here will be to start by imagining

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,260
teaching complex numbers to someone who only understands one dimension, then describing

52
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,420
3D rotations to someone who only understands two dimensions, and ultimately to represent

53
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:17,540
what quaternions are doing up in four dimensions within the constraints of our 3D space.

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,180
Our first character is Linus the Linelander, whose mind can only grasp the one-dimensional

55
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,400
geometry of lines and the algebra of real numbers. We're going to try to describe

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,340
complex numbers to Linus, and it's really important for you to empathize with him as

57
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,940
much as you can during this, because in a few minutes you're going to be in his shoes.

58
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,180
On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically. You say each

59
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,060
one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i, where i is

60
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,500
a newly invented constant whose defining property is that i times i equals negative 1. Then

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,140
you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers, you just use the distributive property,

62
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:02,020
what many people learn in school as FOIL, and apply this rule, i times i equals negative

63
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,580
1, to simplify things down further. And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard

64
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,320
textbook way to introduce quaternions is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling

65
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,620
it done. But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the

66
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,240
geometry of complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like, since the problems

67
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,480
in math and physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often leverage this

68
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,800
spatial intuition. You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,120
When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w, you can think of z as a sort of function

70
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,420
acting on w, rotating and stretching it in some way. I like to think of this by broadening

71
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,580
the view and asking, what does z do to the entire plane? And you can think of that bird's

72
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,600
eye view action by imagining using one hand to fix the number 0 in place, and using another

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,500
hand to drag the point at 1 up to z, since anything times 0 is 0, and anything times

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,600
1 is itself. And in two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching rotating action

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
on the plane that'll do this. This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion

76
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,900
multiplication later on, where the number on the left acts as a kind of function to

77
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,540
the one on the right, and we'll understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming

78
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,820
the space, although instead of rotating 2d space, it does a sort of double rotation in

79
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,840
4d space. By the way, if you want to review thinking

80
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,480
about complex numbers as a kind of action, a good warmup for this video might be the

81
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,040
one I did on e to the pi i explained with introductory group theory.

82
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,460
Linus the Linelander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching, that's what

83
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,460
multiplication by real numbers looks like. Maybe it's a little weird for him to think

84
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,700
about stretching in multiple dimensions, but it's not fundamentally different. The

85
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,940
difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation. Specifically, focus on the unit

86
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,060
circle of the complex plane, all the numbers a distance 1 from 0, since multiplication

87
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,340
by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation. How would you explain to Linus the look and

88
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,620
feel of multiplying by these numbers? At first, that might seem impossible, rotation

89
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,740
is just an intrinsically two-dimensional idea. But on the other hand, rotation involves

90
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,260
only one degree of freedom, a single number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.

91
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,900
So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all rotations to the

92
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,660
one-dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.

93
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,940
And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you is called

94
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,160
a stereographic projection. It's a special way to map a circle onto a line, or a sphere

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:46,280
into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.

96
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,720
For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative 1 through that point, and

97
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,000
wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle's center, that's where the point

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,680
of the circle gets projected. So for example, the point at 1 gets projected into the center

99
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:10,720
of the line, the point i actually stays fixed in place, as does negative i.

100
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,280
All of the points on that 90 degree arc between 1 and i will get projected somewhere in the

101
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,560
interval between where 1 landed and where i landed. As you continue farther around the

102
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,920
circle on the arc between i and negative 1, the projected points end up farther and farther

103
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,480
away at an increasing rate. Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative

104
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,720
1, the projected points end up farther and farther on the other end of the line. This

105
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,160
line of projected points is what we show to Linus, labeling a few key points, like 1 and

106
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,680
i and negative 1 all for reference. Technically, the point at negative 1 has no projection

107
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,420
under this map, since the tangent line to the circle at that point never crosses the

108
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,520
vertical line. But what we say is that negative 1 ends up at the point at infinity, a special

109
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,620
point you imagine adding to the line where you would approach it if you walk infinitely

110
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,800
far along the line in either direction.

111
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Now it's important to remember, and to remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only the

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,960
complex numbers that are a distance 1 from the origin, the unit circle. Linus doesn't

113
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,120
see most numbers, like 0 or 1 plus i or negative 2 minus i, but that's okay, because right

114
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,040
now we just want to describe complex numbers z where multiplying by z has the effect of

115
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,180
a pure rotation, so he only needs to understand the unit circle.

116
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,540
For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w,

117
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,040
the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise. And when we apply this action to the circle

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,120
being projected down to the line for Linus, what does he see? Well, it's a bit of a

119
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,880
strange morphing action on the line, one which I want you to become familiar with for something

120
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,640
we'll see later on. It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points. i

121
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,400
times 1 is i, so that means the number 1 should move up to i. i times i is negative 1, so

122
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,720
the point at i slides off to infinity. i times negative 1 is equal to negative i, so that

123
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,960
point at infinity kind of comes back around from the bottom to the position 1 unit below

124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,600
the center. i times negative i is 1, so that point at negative i slides up to 1. Even though

125
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,140
this is kind of a weird motion, it lets us communicate some important ideas to Linus.

126
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,820
For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating by 90 degrees

127
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,880
four times in a row, gets us back to where we started. i to the fourth equals 1. To get

128
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,320
more of a feel for things, let me just show the circle rotated at various different angles.

129
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,960
On both the left and right half of the screen, I'm putting a hand on the point that started

130
00:10:50,960 --> 00:11:06,920
at the number 1 to help us and help Linus keep track of the overall motion.

131
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,040
Next let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.

132
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.

133
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,400
In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions, let's extend the complex

134
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,280
numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and its vertical axis of imaginary numbers

135
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,360
with a third axis, defined by some newly invented constant, j, sitting one unit away from 0,

136
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,120
perpendicular to the complex plane. Instead of having this new axis in the z direction,

137
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,680
like you might expect, for a better analogy with how we'll visualize quaternions, we'll

138
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,880
want to orient things so that the i and j axes sit in the x and y directions, with the

139
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,320
real number aligned along the z direction. Every point in 3D space is described as some

140
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,600
real number plus some real number times i plus some real number times j. As it happens,

141
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,320
it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication for a 3D number system like this that would

142
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,160
satisfy the usual algebraic properties that make multiplication a useful construct. Perhaps

143
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,280
I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video, but staying focused on our current

144
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,880
goal, think about describing 3D rotations in this coordinate system to Felix the Flatlander.

145
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,120
The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance 1 from 0 at the origin,

146
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,320
meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is 1.

147
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,400
We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is project this 2D surface

148
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,200
to him and give him a feel for what reorientations of the sphere look like under that projection.

149
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,880
Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will associate almost every point

150
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,960
on the unit sphere with a unique point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and

151
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,160
j axes. For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative 1 at the south pole through

152
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:12,600
that point and see where it intersects the plane.

153
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,840
The point 1 at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane, all of the points of

154
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,760
the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere inside the unit circle of the i-j plane, and

155
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,960
that unit circle which passes through i, j, negative i, negative j, stays fixed in place.

156
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,840
And that's an important point to make note of. Even though most points and lines and

157
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,860
patches that Felix the flightlander sees are warped projections of the real sphere, this

158
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,480
unit circle is the one thing he has which is an honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered

159
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,860
by projection. All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit

160
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,440
circle, each getting farther and farther away as you approach negative 1 at the south pole.

161
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,080
And again, negative 1 has no projection under this mapping, but what we say is that it ends

162
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,960
up at some point at infinity. That point at infinity is something such that no matter

163
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,340
which direction you walk on the plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching

164
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,880
that point. It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole,

165
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,280
you're approaching the south pole.

166
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,120
Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions. As I rotate the sphere

167
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,640
in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on that sphere get projected

168
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,260
into various circles and lines in Felix's space. The way I've done things up here,

169
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,080
the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the sphere is accurately reflected in the

170
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,380
projected view you see with Felix, and the pink dot represents where the point that started

171
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,960
at the north pole ends up after the rotation, and the yellow circle represents where the

172
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,760
equator ended up after the projection. The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes

173
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,040
right now, the easier quaternions will be in a moment. And as with Linus, it helps to

174
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,680
focus on a few key reference objects rather than trying to see the whole sphere. This

175
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,800
circle passing through 1, i, negative 1, and negative i gets mapped onto a line which Felix

176
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,920
sees as the horizontal axis. It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the

177
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,600
same thing as the i axis. Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance

178
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,840
1 from the origin, so most points on the actual i axis, like 0, 2i, 3i, etc., are completely

179
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:34,160
invisible to Felix. Similarly, the circle that passes through 1, j, negative 1, and

180
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,240
negative j gets projected onto what he sees as a vertical line. And in general, any line

181
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,920
that Felix sees comes from some circle on the sphere that passes through negative 1.

182
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,920
In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the point at infinity.

183
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere. A 90 degree rotation about the

184
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,480
j axis brings 1 to i, i to negative 1, negative 1 to negative i, and negative i to 1. So what

185
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,320
Felix the flatlander sees is an extension of the rotation that Linus the line-lander

186
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,720
was seeing. Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where

187
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,200
the 1, j unit circle used to be. So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed

188
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,200
into a vertical line, while that red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.

189
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,720
Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion, no actual stretching

190
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,920
or morphing is taking place. All of that is just an artifact of the projection. Similarly,

191
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,200
a rotation about the i axis involves moving 1 to j, j to negative 1, negative 1 to negative

192
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,640
j, and negative j to 1. This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the 1, i unit circle,

193
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,360
which to Felix looks like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.

194
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:14,280
A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand, since the whole

195
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,760
projection simply gets rotated about the origin, where the only points staying fixed in place are

196
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:31,200
1 at the origin and negative 1 off at infinity. In the same way that the complex numbers include

197
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,840
the real numbers with a single extra imaginary dimension, represented by the unit i, and that

198
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,640
the not-actually-a-number system thing we had in three dimensions included a second imaginary

199
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,400
direction, j, the quaternions include the real numbers together with three separate imaginary

200
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,720
dimensions, represented by the units i, j, and k. Each of these three imaginary dimensions is

201
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,080
perpendicular to the real number line, and they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.

202
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,320
So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers,

203
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,280
each quaternion can be written using four real numbers and it lives in four-dimensional space.

204
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,760
You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part and then a 3D imaginary part,

205
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,280
and Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i, j, k components,

206
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,880
a word which was previously somewhat foreign in the lingo of math and physics,

207
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,200
vector. On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules

208
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,880
for how i, j, and k multiply together and saying that everything must distribute nicely. This is

209
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i times i is negative 1 and then

210
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,880
distributing and simplifying products. And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform

211
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,520
quaternion multiplication, and the relative compactness of this operation compared to,

212
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,160
say, matrix multiplication, is what's made quaternion so useful for graphics programming

213
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,880
and many other things. There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written

214
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,440
in terms of the dot product and the cross product, and in some sense, quaternion multiplication

215
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,280
subsumes both of these notions, at least as they appear in three dimensions.

216
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,560
But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding its

217
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,520
geometry, that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and rotating,

218
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion multiplication.

219
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,960
And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero, is the square root of the sum

220
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,760
of the squares of its component, that same operation gives you the magnitude of a quaternion.

221
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,600
And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2, has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude

222
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,840
of q1, followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions. And those special

223
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,800
4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand, correspond to the hypersphere of

224
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,400
quaternions, a distance one from the origin, both in the sense that the quaternions whose multiplying

225
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,320
action is a pure rotation live on that hypersphere, and in the sense that we can understand this weird

226
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,960
4D action just by following points on the hypersphere, rather than trying to look at all

227
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,080
of the points in the inconceivable stretches of four-dimensional space. Analogous to what we did

228
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,120
for Linus and Felix, we stereographically project this hypersphere into 3D space.

229
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,960
This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion, and this little pink dot

230
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,360
will show where that particular quaternion gets projected in our 3D space. Just as before,

231
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,000
we're projecting from the number negative one, which sits on the real number line that is somehow

232
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,160
perpendicular to all of our 3D space, and beyond our perception. Just as before, the number one

233
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,920
ends up projected straight into the center of our space. And in the same way that i and negative i

234
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,440
were fixed in place for Linus, and that the ij unit circle was fixed in place for Felix,

235
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,240
we get a whole sphere passing through i, j, and k on that unit hypersphere, which stays in place

236
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,000
under the projection. So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only

237
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,360
unaltered part of the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us. It's something

238
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,800
analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere, and it represents all of the unit quaternions whose

239
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:33,040
real part is zero, what Hamilton would have described as unit vectors. The unit quaternions

240
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,800
with positive real parts, between 0 and 1, end up somewhere inside this unit sphere, closer to the

241
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,520
number one in our 3D space, which should feel analogous to how the northern hemisphere got

242
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,520
mapped inside the unit circle for Felix. On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with

243
00:21:49,520 --> 00:22:01,920
negative real part end up somewhere outside that unit sphere. The number negative one is sitting

244
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,680
off at the point at infinity, which you can easily find by walking in any direction.

245
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions as being closer or

246
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,720
farther from the origin of our 3D space, everything you're looking at represents a unit quaternion,

247
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,360
so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude, the same distance from the number

248
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,280
zero. And that number zero itself is nowhere to be found in this picture. Like all other non-unit

249
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,760
quaternions, it's invisible to us. In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through 1,

250
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,920
i, negative 1, and negative i got projected into a line through the origin,

251
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,280
when we see this line through the origin passing through i and negative i, we should understand

252
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,880
that it really represents a circle. Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us, there is a

253
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,320
unit sphere passing through 1, i, j, negative 1, negative i, and negative j, and that whole sphere

254
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,240
gets projected into the plane that we see passing through 1, i, negative i, j, negative j, and

255
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,080
negative 1 off at infinity, what you and I might call the xy plane. In general, any plane that you

256
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,120
see here really represents the projection of a sphere somewhere up on the hypersphere which

257
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,800
passes through the number negative 1.

258
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,800
Now the action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion from the

259
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,880
left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2d rotations happening perpendicular to and in

260
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,320
sync with each other in a way that could only ever be possible in four dimensions. As a first example,

261
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,440
let's look at multiplication by i. We already know what this does to the circle that passes through

262
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:50,080
1 and i, which we see as a line. 1 goes to i, i goes to negative 1 off at infinity,

263
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,920
negative 1 comes back around to negative i, and negative i goes to 1.

264
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,680
Remember, just like what Linus saw, all of this is the stereographic projection of a 90 degree

265
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,080
rotation. Now look at the circle passing through j and k, which is in a sense perpendicular to the

266
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,200
circle passing through 1 and i. It might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular

267
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,520
to each other, especially when they have the same center and same radius and don't touch each other,

268
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,280
but nothing could be more natural in four dimensions. You can think of the action of i

269
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,800
on this perpendicular circle as obeying a certain right-hand rule. If you'll excuse the intrusion

270
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,680
of my ghostly green-screen hand into our otherwise pristine platonic mathematical stage,

271
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,520
you let that thumb of your right hand point from the number 1 to i, and you curl your fingers. The

272
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,240
j-k circle will rotate in the direction of that curl. How much? Well, by the same amount as the

273
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,480
1i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case. This is what I meant by two rotations

274
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,160
perpendicular to and in sync with each other. So j goes to k, k goes to negative j,

275
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,400
negative j goes to negative k, and negative k goes to j.

276
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,280
This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions,

277
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,800
but I want this not to be something that you memorize, but something that you could close

278
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,720
your eyes and you could really see. Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers

279
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,400
1, i, j, and k, you know what it does to any arbitrary quaternion, since multiplication

280
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,960
distributes nicely. In the language of linear algebra, 1, i, j, and k form a basis of our

281
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,920
four-dimensional space, so knowing what our transformation does to them gives us the full

282
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,440
information about what it does to all of space. Geometrically, a four-dimensional creature would

283
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,160
be able to look at those two perpendicular rotations that I just described, and understand

284
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,360
that they lock you into one and only one rigid motion for the hypersphere. We might lack the

285
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,400
intuitions of such a hypothetical creature, but we can maybe try to get close. Here's what the

286
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,640
action of repeatedly multiplying by i looks like on our stereographic projection of the i, j, k sphere.

287
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,480
It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it used to be,

288
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,800
though the orientation is all reversed now. Then it gets rotated again into what we see as a plane,

289
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,240
and after the fourth iteration it ends up right back where it started. As another example, think

290
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,320
of a quaternion like q equals negative square root of 2 over 2 plus square root of 2 over 2 times i,

291
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,360
which if we pull up a picture of a complex plane is a 135 degree rotation away from 1 in the

292
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,840
direction of i. Under our projection, we see this along the line from 1 to i somewhere outside the

293
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,560
unit sphere. If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.

294
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,880
The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us like dragging the

295
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,760
point at 1 all the way to this projected version of q, while the j, k circle gets rotated 135

296
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:12,320
degrees according to our right hand rule. Multiplication by any other quaternion is

297
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,960
completely similar. For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act on other quaternions

298
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,880
by multiplication from the left. The circle through 1 and j, which we see projected as a

299
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:31,040
line through the origin, gets rotated 90 degrees, dragging 1 up to j, so j times 1 is 1 and j times j

300
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:43,600
is negative 1. The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k, gets rotated 90

301
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,720
degrees according to this rule, where you point your thumb from 1 to j, so j times i is negative k

302
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
and j times k is i.

303
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space,

304
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,080
start by drawing the unit circle passing through 1, q, and negative 1, which we see in our projection

305
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,200
as a line through the origin. Then draw the circle perpendicular to that one on what we see

306
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,440
as the unit sphere. You rotate the first circle so that 1 ends up where q was, and rotate the

307
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,240
perpendicular circle by the same amount according to the right hand rule.

308
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:45,520
One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters. It's not, as mathematicians

309
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,360
would say, commutative. For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of i

310
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:58,160
acting on the quaternion j, rotating it up to k, but if you think of j as acting on i, j times i,

311
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,600
it rotates i to negative k. In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication,

312
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,120
is a way more special property than a lot of people realize, and most groups of actions on some

313
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,600
space don't have it. It's like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot, or how rotating

314
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,040
a cube about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives a different final state from rotating it

315
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:32,240
about the x-axis, then about the z-axis. And last, as one final but rather important point,

316
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,880
so far I've shown you how to think about quaternions as acting by left multiplication,

317
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,760
where when you read an expression like i times j, you think of i as a kind of function morphing all

318
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,720
of space, and j is just one of the points that it's acting on. But you can also think of them

319
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,080
as a different sort of action, by multiplying from the right, where in this expression, j would be

320
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,840
acting on i. In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar. It's still the case

321
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,600
that 1 goes to j and j goes to negative 1, etc., but instead of applying the right-hand rule to the

322
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,760
circle perpendicular to the 1j circle, you would use your left hand. So either way, i times j is

323
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,040
equal to k, but you can either think about this with your right hand curling the number j to the

324
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,960
number k as your thumb points from 1 to i, or as your left hand curling i to k as its thumb points

325
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,120
from 1 to j. Understanding this left-hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be

326
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,560
extremely useful for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three dimensions.

327
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,520
And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3d rotation. I mean,

328
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,000
if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i, j, and k,

329
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,560
it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position. So the way that this works is

330
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,160
slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product. It involves a process called conjugation,

331
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,000
and I'll make a full follow-on video all about it so that we have the time to go through some

332
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,680
examples. In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation

333
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,200
to orientation in 3d space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you are familiar

334
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,600
with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video. Link in the description.

335
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,200
If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it with some friends, and if you felt like the narrative

336
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,520
structure here was actually helpful for understanding, maybe reassure those friends

337
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,680
who would be turned off by a large timestamp that good math is actually worth the time.

338
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,560
And many thanks to the patrons among you. I actually spent way longer than I care to

339
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,440
admit on this project, so your patience and support is especially appreciated this time around.
