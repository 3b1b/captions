1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,670
What you're looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, 

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,990
or rather you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion 

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,185
happening on a four-dimensional sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space, 

4
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,280
one which you'll understand by the end of this video.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,072
Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and 

6
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:26,640
often underappreciated number system from math.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,401
Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers, 

8
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:34,860
quaternions are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,037
But they're not just playful mathematical shenanigans, 

10
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:42,417
they have a surprisingly pragmatic utility for describing rotation in three dimensions, 

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,960
and even for quantum mechanics.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,780
The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,556
The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life 

14
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:55,200
seeking a three-dimensional number system, analogous to the complex numbers.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,285
And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning whether or not he 

16
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,700
had figured out how to divide triples, and he would always say no, not yet.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,098
But on October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin, 

18
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:09,696
he realized, with a supposed flash of insight, 

19
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:14,008
that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to the complex numbers, 

20
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,821
but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions 

21
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,801
describing space and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in 

22
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,460
some kind of fourth dimension.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,317
He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge, 

24
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,480
which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.

25
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,703
Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their 

26
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,156
dot product and the cross product and things like that didn't really 

27
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,260
exist in Hamilton's time, at least not in a standardized form.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,691
So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary 

29
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,688
language with which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space, 

30
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:54,580
even forming an official quaternion society to proselytize his discovery.

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,835
Unfortunately, this was balanced with mathematicians on the other side of the fence, 

32
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:03,440
who believed that the confusing notion of quaternion multiplication was 

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,794
not necessary for describing three dimensions, 

34
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:10,100
resulting in some truly hilarious old-timey trash talk legitimately calling them evil.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,233
It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland, 

36
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,862
whose author you may know was an Oxford mathematician, 

37
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:20,399
was written in reference to quaternions, that the chaotic table placement 

38
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:23,840
changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain quotes were 

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,800
referencing their non-commutative nature.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,019
Fast forward about a century, and the computing industry gave 

41
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,361
quaternions a resurgence among programmers who work with graphics 

42
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,400
and robotics and anything involving orientation in 3D space.

43
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,209
And this is because they give an elegant way to describe and compute 3D rotations, 

44
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,296
which is computationally more efficient than other methods, 

45
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:48,720
and which also avoids a lot of the numerical errors that arise in these other methods.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,940
The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love 

47
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,600
from a completely different direction, quantum mechanics.

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,739
The special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are 

49
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,319
actually quite relevant to the way that two-state systems like spin of 

50
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,000
an electron or the polarization of a photon are described mathematically.

51
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,753
What I'll show you here is a way to visualize 

52
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,240
quaternions in their full four-dimensional glory.

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,189
It would surprise me if this approach was fully original, 

54
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:19,105
but I can say that it's certainly not the standard way to teach quaternions, 

55
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:23,427
and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand rule image I'd like to build up to 

56
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:25,360
is something I haven't seen elsewhere.

57
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,364
Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time, 

58
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,198
but once you have it, there is a very natural and satisfying 

59
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:34,940
intuition for how to think about quaternion multiplication.

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,059
It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions 

61
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:42,729
describe orientation in three dimensions, which is for some people the whole 

62
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,447
reason we care about it, but once we're able to go at it armed with the image 

63
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:50,069
of what they're doing to a 4D hypersphere, there's a pleasing understanding 

64
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,740
to be had for the otherwise opaque formulas characterizing this relationship.

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,424
The structure here will be to start by imagining teaching complex numbers to 

66
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:03,495
someone who only understands one dimension, then describing 3D rotations to 

67
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:07,673
someone who only understands two dimensions, and ultimately to represent what 

68
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:12,120
quaternions are doing up in four dimensions within the constraints of our 3D space.

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,927
Our first character is Linus the Linelander, whose mind can only grasp 

70
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,760
the one-dimensional geometry of lines and the algebra of real numbers.

71
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,791
We're going to try to describe complex numbers to Linus, 

72
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,608
and it's really important for you to empathize with him as much as you can during this, 

73
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:34,080
because in a few minutes you're going to be in his shoes.

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,180
On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically.

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,420
You say each one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i, 

76
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,772
where i is a newly invented constant whose defining property 

77
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,860
is that i times i equals negative one.

78
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,856
Then you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers, 

79
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:58,005
you just use the distributive property, what many people learn in school as FOIL, 

80
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:02,903
and you apply this rule that i times i equals negative one to simplify things 

81
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:03,720
down further.

82
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,034
And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard textbook way to introduce 

83
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:11,780
quaternions is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling it done.

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,596
But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the geometry of 

85
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,560
complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like, 

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,885
since the problems in math and physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often 

87
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:25,440
leverage this spatial intuition.

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,180
You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,368
When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w, 

90
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:35,812
you can think of z as a sort of function acting on w, 

91
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:38,300
rotating and stretching it in some way.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,575
I like to think of this by broadening the view and asking, 

93
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,080
what does z do to the entire plane?

94
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,864
You can think of that bird's eye view action by imagining using one hand to 

95
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:53,677
fix the number zero in place, and using another hand to drag the point at one up to z, 

96
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:57,440
since anything times zero is zero, and anything times one is itself.

97
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,730
In two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching 

98
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,940
rotating action on the plane that'll do this.

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,830
This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion multiplication later on, 

100
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,008
where the number on the left acts as a kind of function to the one on the right, 

101
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:16,135
and we'll understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming space, 

102
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:20,520
although instead of rotating 2d space, it does a sort of double rotation in 4d space.

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,848
By the way, if you want to review thinking about complex numbers as a kind of action, 

104
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:29,787
a good warmup for this video might be the one I did on e to the 

105
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,900
pi i explained with introductory group theory.

106
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,092
Now Linus the line lander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching, 

107
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:38,360
that's what multiplication by real numbers looks like.

108
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,384
Maybe it's a little weird for him to think about stretching in multiple dimensions, 

109
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:43,920
but it's not fundamentally different.

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,500
The difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation.

111
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,731
Specifically, focus on the unit circle of the complex plane, 

112
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:53,840
all the numbers a distance 1 from 0.

113
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,937
Since multiplication by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation, 

114
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:02,580
how would you explain to Linus the look and feel of multiplying by these numbers?

115
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,617
At first, that might seem impossible, rotation is 

116
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,380
just such an intrinsically two-dimensional idea.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,514
But, on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom, 

118
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:19,460
a single number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.

119
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,947
So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all 

120
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:27,680
rotations to the one-dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.

121
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,794
And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you 

122
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:37,502
is called a stereographic projection, it's a special way to map a circle onto a line, 

123
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:41,060
or a sphere into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.

124
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,508
For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative 1 through that point, 

125
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:54,637
and wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle's center, 

126
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,540
that's where the point of the circle gets projected.

127
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,102
So for example, the point at 1 gets projected into the center of the line, 

128
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:07,940
the point i actually stays fixed in place, as does negative i.

129
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,906
All of the points on that 90 degree arc between 1 and i will get projected 

130
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:19,120
somewhere in the interval between where 1 landed and where i landed.

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,358
As you continue farther around the circle on the arc between i and negative 1, 

132
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:28,420
the projected points end up farther and farther away at an increasing rate.

133
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,066
Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative 1, 

134
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,659
the projected points end up farther and farther on the other end of the line.

135
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,703
This line of projected points is what we show to Linus, 

136
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:44,140
labeling a few key points, like 1 and i and negative 1 all for reference.

137
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,305
Technically, the point at negative 1 has no projection under this map, 

138
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:52,240
since the tangent line to the circle at that point never crosses the vertical line.

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,450
But what we say is that negative 1 ends up at the point at infinity, 

140
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,176
a special point you imagine adding to the line where you would approach 

141
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:03,540
it if you walk infinitely far along the line in either direction.

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,586
It's important to remember, and remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only 

143
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:12,580
the complex numbers that are a distance 1 from the origin, the unit circle.

144
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,800
Linus doesn't see most numbers, like 0, or 1 plus i, or negative 2 minus i, 

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,839
but that's okay, because right now we just want to describe complex numbers z where 

146
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,960
multiplying by z has the effect of a pure rotation, 

147
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,780
so he only needs to understand the unit circle.

148
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,869
For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w, 

149
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:39,170
the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, 

150
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,357
and when we apply this action to the circle being projected down to the line for Linus, 

151
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:45,360
what does he see?

152
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,105
Well, it's a bit of a strange morphing action on the line, 

153
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:52,920
one which I want you to become familiar with for something we'll see later on.

154
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,480
It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points.

155
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,780
i times 1 is i, so that means the number 1 should move up to i.

156
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,140
i times i is negative 1, so the point at i slides off to infinity.

157
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,236
i times negative 1 is equal to negative i, so that point at infinity kind 

158
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:19,520
of comes back around from the bottom to the position 1 unit below the center.

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,460
i times negative i is 1, so the point at negative i slides up to 1.

160
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,354
Even though this is kind of a weird motion, it 

161
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,540
lets us communicate some important ideas to Linus.

162
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,854
For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating 

163
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:38,400
by 90 degrees four times in a row, gets us back to where we started.

164
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,520
i to the fourth equals 1.

165
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,679
To get more of a feel for things, let me just show 

166
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,780
the circle rotated at various different angles.

167
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,919
On both the left and right half of the screen, 

168
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,469
I'm putting a hand on the point that started at the number 1 to help us and help 

169
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,660
Linus keep track of the overall motion.

170
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,220
Next, let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.

171
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,160
Imagine trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.

172
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,830
In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions, 

173
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,972
let's extend the complex numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and 

174
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:29,052
its vertical axis of imaginary numbers with a third axis, 

175
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:33,141
defined by some newly invented constant, j, sitting one unit away from zero, 

176
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,000
perpendicular to the complex plane.

177
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,090
Instead of having this new axis in the z-direction, like you might expect, 

178
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,496
for a better analogy with how we'll visualize quaternions, 

179
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:48,346
we'll want to orient things so that the i and j axes sit in the x and y directions, 

180
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:51,580
with the real number line aligned along the z-direction.

181
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,085
Every point in 3D space is described as some real number 

182
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,860
plus some real number times i plus some real number times j.

183
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,109
As it happens, it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication 

184
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:08,199
for a 3D number system like this that would satisfy the usual 

185
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,440
algebraic properties that make multiplication a useful construct.

186
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,250
Perhaps I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video, 

187
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,641
but staying focused on our current goal, think about describing 

188
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:21,980
3D rotations in this coordinate system to Felix the Flatlander.

189
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,700
The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance 1 from 

190
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,780
0 at the origin, meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is 1.

191
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,330
We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is 

192
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,766
project this 2D surface to him and give him a feel for what 

193
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:45,260
reorientations of the sphere look like under that projection.

194
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,744
Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will 

195
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:53,232
associate almost every point on the unit sphere with a unique 

196
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,720
point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and the j axes.

197
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,416
For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative 1 at the 

198
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,640
south pole through that point and see where it intersects the plane.

199
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,520
So the point 1 at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane.

200
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,131
All of the points of the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere 

201
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:24,218
inside the unit circle of the i-j plane, and that unit circle 

202
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:28,240
which passes through i,j,-i,-j actually stays fixed in place.

203
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,940
And that's an important point to make note of.

204
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,504
Even though most points and lines and patches that Felix the Flatlander sees 

205
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:39,909
are warped projections of the real sphere, this unit circle is the one thing 

206
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,200
he has which is an honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered by projection.

207
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,233
All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit circle, 

208
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:55,660
each getting farther and farther away as you approach negative 1 at the south pole.

209
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,613
And again, negative 1 has no projection under this mapping, 

210
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:02,820
but what we say is that it ends up at some point at infinity.

211
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,282
That point at infinity is something such that no matter which direction you walk 

212
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:10,860
on the plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching that point.

213
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,903
It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole, 

214
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,500
you're approaching the south pole.

215
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,200
Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions.

216
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,470
As I rotate the sphere in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude 

217
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,440
drawn on that sphere get projected into various circles and lines in Felix's space.

218
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,786
And the way I've done things up here, the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the 

219
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:41,777
sphere is accurately reflected in the projected view you see with Felix, 

220
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:46,478
and the pinker view represents where the point that started at the north pole ends up 

221
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:51,180
after the rotation, and the yellow circle represents where the equator ended up after 

222
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,000
the projection.

223
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,506
The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes right now, 

224
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:58,454
the easier quaternions will be in a moment, and as with Linus, 

225
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,636
it helps to focus on a few key reference objects rather than trying 

226
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:02,760
to see the whole sphere.

227
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,677
This circle, passing through 1, i, negative 1, and negative i, 

228
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:11,820
gets mapped onto a line which Felix sees as the horizontal axis.

229
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,480
It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the same thing as the i-axis.

230
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,226
Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance 1 from the origin, 

231
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:25,813
so most points on the actual i-axis, like 0, 2i, 3i, etc., 

232
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,880
are completely invisible to Felix.

233
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,019
Similarly, the circle that passes through 1, j, negative 1, 

234
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,860
and negative j gets projected onto what he sees as a vertical line.

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,616
In general, any line Felix sees comes from some 

236
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:45,100
circle on the sphere that passes through negative 1.

237
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,820
In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the point at infinity.

238
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere.

239
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,578
A 90 degree rotation about the j-axis brings 1 to i, 

240
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,320
i to negative 1, negative 1 to negative i, and negative i to 1.

241
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,972
So what Felix the Flatlander sees is an extension 

242
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:14,060
of the rotation that Linus the Linelander was seeing.

243
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,483
Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where the 1, 

244
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,140
j unit circle used to be.

245
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,446
So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed into a vertical line, 

246
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:31,260
while the red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.

247
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,599
Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion, 

248
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,940
no actual stretching or morphing is taking place.

249
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,580
All of that is just an artifact of the projection.

250
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,570
Similarly, a rotation about the i-axis involves moving 1 to j, 

251
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,820
j to negative 1, negative 1 to negative j, and negative j to 1.

252
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,926
This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the 1, i unit circle, 

253
00:16:55,926 --> 00:17:01,660
which to Felix looks like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.

254
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,279
A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand, 

255
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,784
since the whole projection simply gets rotated about the origin, 

256
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:21,097
where the only points staying fixed in place are 1 at the origin and negative 1 

257
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:21,960
off at infinity.

258
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,732
In the same way that the complex numbers included the real numbers with a single 

259
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:37,679
extra quote unquote imaginary dimension, represented by the unit i, 

260
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,033
and that the not-actually-a-number system thing we had in three dimensions 

261
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:46,387
included a second imaginary direction, j, the quaternions include the real 

262
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:51,437
numbers together with three separate imaginary dimensions, represented by the units i, 

263
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:51,960
j, and k.

264
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,218
Each of these three imaginary dimensions is perpendicular to the real number line, 

265
00:17:57,218 --> 00:18:00,100
and they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.

266
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,245
So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers, 

267
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:09,272
each quaternion can be written using four real numbers, 

268
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,380
and it lives in four-dimensional space.

269
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,879
You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part, 

270
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,480
and then a 3D imaginary part.

271
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,393
And Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i, 

272
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,659
j, k components, a word which was previously somewhat foreign 

273
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,820
in the lingo of math and physics, vector.

274
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,413
On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules 

275
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:38,140
for how i, j, and k multiply together, and saying that everything must distribute nicely.

276
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,145
This is analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i 

277
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:45,700
times i is negative 1, and then distributing and simplifying products.

278
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,688
And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform quaternion multiplication, 

279
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:54,984
and the relative compactness of this operation compared to say matrix multiplication 

280
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:59,180
is what's made quaternion so useful for graphics programming and many other things.

281
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,652
There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written in terms 

282
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:06,529
of the dot product and the cross product, and in some sense, 

283
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:09,264
quaternion multiplication subsumes both of these notions, 

284
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,340
at least as they appear in three dimensions.

285
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,663
But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding 

286
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:20,915
its geometry that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and 

287
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:24,635
rotating, you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion 

288
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,360
multiplication.

289
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,474
And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero, 

290
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:32,734
is the square root of the sum of the squares of its component, 

291
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:35,840
that same operation gives you the magnitude of a quaternion.

292
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,846
And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2, 

293
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:45,645
has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude of q1, 

294
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:50,160
followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions.

295
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,009
And those special 4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand, 

296
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:59,203
correspond to the hypersphere of quaternions, a distance 1 from the origin, 

297
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:03,288
both in the sense that the quaternions whose multiplying action is a pure 

298
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:07,427
rotation live on that hypersphere, and in the sense that we can understand 

299
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:11,070
this weird 4D action just by following points on the hypersphere, 

300
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,264
rather than trying to look at all the points in the inconceivable stretches 

301
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,700
of four-dimensional space.

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,136
Analogous to what we did for Linus and Felix, we 

303
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,460
stereographically project this hypersphere into 3D space.

304
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,072
This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion, 

305
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:37,880
and this little pink dot will show where that quaternion gets projected in our 3D space.

306
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,720
Just as before, we're projecting from the number negative 1, 

307
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,301
which sits on the real number line that is somehow perpendicular to all of our 3D space, 

308
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,640
and beyond our perception.

309
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,040
Just as before, the number 1 ends up projected straight into the center of our space.

310
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,817
And in the same way that i and negative i were fixed in place for Linus, 

311
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:03,894
and that the 3D space and 3D space get a whole sphere passing through i, 

312
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:09,180
j, and k on that unit hypersphere which stays in place under the projection.

313
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,361
So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only unaltered 

314
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:18,580
part of the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us.

315
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,026
It's something analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere, 

316
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:26,014
and it represents all of the unit quaternions whose real part is zero, 

317
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:28,880
what Hamilton would have described as unit vectors.

318
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,322
The unit quaternions with positive real parts, between 0 and 1, 

319
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:39,886
end up somewhere inside this unit sphere, closer to the number 1 in our 3D space, 

320
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:44,395
which should feel analogous to how the northern hemisphere got mapped inside the 

321
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:45,620
unit circle for Felix.

322
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,274
On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with negative 

323
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:52,780
real part end up somewhere outside that unit sphere.

324
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,147
The number negative 1 is sitting off at the point at infinity, 

325
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:05,760
which you can easily find by walking in any direction.

326
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,837
Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions 

327
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:13,843
as being closer or farther from the origin of our 3D space, 

328
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:16,799
everything you're looking at represents a unit quaternion, 

329
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,956
so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude, 

330
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:21,760
the same distance from the number 0.

331
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,740
And that number 0 itself is nowhere to be found in this picture.

332
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,580
Like all other non-unit quaternions, it's invisible to us.

333
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,468
In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through 1, i, negative 1, 

334
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:39,151
and negative i got projected into a line through the origin, 

335
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:43,679
when we see this line through the origin passing through i and negative i, 

336
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,060
we should understand that it really represents a circle.

337
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,716
Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us, 

338
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:55,232
there is a unit sphere passing through 1, i, j, negative 1, negative i, 

339
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,250
and negative j, and that whole sphere gets projected into the plane that we see 

340
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,393
passing through 1, i, negative i, j, negative j, and negative 1, off at infinity, 

341
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:07,840
what you and I might call the xy plane.

342
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,626
In general, any plane that you see here really represents the projection of a 

343
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:16,880
sphere somewhere up on the hypersphere which passes through the number negative 1.

344
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,186
The action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion from 

345
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:27,984
the left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2D rotations, 

346
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:33,048
happening perpendicular to and in sync with each other in a way that could only ever be 

347
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:34,660
possible in four dimensions.

348
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,040
As a first example, let's look at multiplication by i.

349
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,732
We already know what this does to the circle that passes through 1 and i, 

350
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:43,980
which we see as a line.

351
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,206
1 goes to i, i goes to negative 1, off at infinity, 

352
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:56,000
negative 1 comes back around to negative i, and negative i goes to 1.

353
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,426
Remember, just like what Linus saw, all of this is 

354
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:02,260
the stereographic projection of a 90 degree rotation.

355
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,760
Now look at the circle passing through j and k, 

356
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,720
which is in a sense perpendicular to the circle passing through 1 and i.

357
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,118
It might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular to each other, 

358
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:18,288
especially when they have the same center and radius and don't touch each other at all, 

359
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,800
but nothing could be more natural in four dimensions.

360
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,533
You can think of the action of i on this perpendicular circle as obeying 

361
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:29,373
a certain right-hand rule, if you'll excuse the intrusion of my ghostly 

362
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:33,320
green-screen hand into our otherwise pristine platonic mathematical stage.

363
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,447
You let that thumb of your right hand point from the number 1 to i, 

364
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,880
and you curl your fingers.

365
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,020
The j-k circle will rotate in the direction of that curl.

366
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,120
How much?

367
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,020
Well, by the same amount as the 1i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case.

368
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,480
This is what I meant by two rotations perpendicular to and in sync with each other.

369
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:05,184
So j goes to k, k goes to negative j, negative j goes to negative k, 

370
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:08,700
and negative k goes to j.

371
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,782
This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions, 

372
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:17,198
but I want this not to be something you memorize, 

373
00:25:17,198 --> 00:25:20,340
but something you could close your eyes and you could really see.

374
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,272
Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers 1, i, j, and k, 

375
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,302
you know what it does to any arbitrary quaternion, 

376
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,680
since multiplication distributes nicely.

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,122
In the language of linear algebra, 1, i, j, and k form a basis of 

378
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:40,122
our 4-dimensional space, so knowing what our transformation does to 

379
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,240
them gives us the full information about what it does to all of space.

380
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,665
Geometrically, a 4-dimensional creature would be able to look at 

381
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:51,422
those two perpendicular rotations I just described, 

382
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:56,140
and understand that they lock you into one and only one rigid motion for the hypersphere.

383
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,590
We might lack the intuitions of such a hypothetical creature, 

384
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,220
but we can maybe try to get close.

385
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,995
Here's what the action of repeatedly multiplying by i 

386
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:08,740
looks like on our stereographic projection of the ijk sphere.

387
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,320
It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it 

388
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,132
used to be, though the orientation is reversed now, 

389
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:21,730
then gets rotated again into what we see as a plane, and after the fourth iteration, 

390
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,840
it ends up right back where it started.

391
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,077
As another example, think of a quaternion like q equals negative square root 

392
00:26:30,077 --> 00:26:33,348
of 2 over 2 plus square root of 2 over 2 times i, 

393
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:36,620
which if we pull up a picture of a complex plane, 

394
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,480
is a 135 degree rotation away from 1 in the direction of i.

395
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,910
Under our projection, we see this along the line 

396
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,540
from 1 to i somewhere outside the unit sphere.

397
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,680
If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.

398
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,453
The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us 

399
00:26:56,453 --> 00:27:01,182
like dragging the point at 1 all the way to this projected version of q, 

400
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:06,300
while the jk circle gets rotated 135 degrees, according to our right-hand rule.

401
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,220
Multiplication by any other quaternion is completely similar.

402
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,194
For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act 

403
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:18,560
on other quaternions by multiplication from the left.

404
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,312
The circle through 1 and j, which we see projected as a line through the origin, 

405
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:31,853
gets rotated 90 degrees, dragging 1 up to j, so j times 1 is 1 and j times j is negative 

406
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:32,000
1.

407
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,347
The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k, 

408
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:48,298
gets rotated 90 degrees according to this right-hand rule, 

409
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:55,600
where you point your thumb from 1 to j, so j times i is negative k, and j times k is i.

410
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,842
In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space, 

411
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:10,003
start by drawing the unit circle passing through 1, q, and negative 1, 

412
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:13,520
which we see in our projection as a line through the origin.

413
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,100
Then draw the circle perpendicular to that 1 on what we see as the unit sphere.

414
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,415
You rotate the first circle so that 1 ends up where q was, 

415
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:27,660
and rotate the perpendicular circle by the same amount according to the right-hand rule.

416
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,680
One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters.

417
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,700
It's not, as mathematicians would say, commutative.

418
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,696
For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of i acting on the 

419
00:28:53,696 --> 00:29:00,740
quaternion j, but if you think of j as acting on i, j times i, it rotates i to negative k.

420
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,440
In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication, 

421
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,440
is a way more special property than a lot of people realize.

422
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,360
And most groups of actions on some space don't have it.

423
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,465
It's like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot, 

424
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:20,792
or how rotating a cube about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives 

425
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:25,660
a different final state from rotating it about the x-axis, then about the z-axis.

426
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,054
And last, as one final but rather important point, 

427
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:36,752
so far I've shown you how to think about quaternions as acting by left multiplication, 

428
00:29:36,752 --> 00:29:39,451
where when you read an expression like i times j, 

429
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:42,692
you think of i as a kind of function morphing all of space, 

430
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:44,960
and j as one of the points it's acting on.

431
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,470
But you can also think of them as a different sort of action, 

432
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,000
by multiplying from the right, where in this expression, j would be acting on i.

433
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,420
In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar.

434
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,522
It's still the case that 1 goes to j, and j goes to negative 1, 

435
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:04,105
etc., but instead of applying the right-hand rule to the circle 

436
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:07,520
perpendicular to the 1j circle, you would use your left hand.

437
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,246
So either way, i times j is equal to k, but you can either think about this 

438
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:18,595
with your right hand curling the number j to the number k as your thumb points 

439
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:24,080
from 1 to i, or as your left hand curling i to k as its thumb points from 1 to j.

440
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,354
Understanding this left-hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be 

441
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:33,897
extremely useful for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three 

442
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:34,500
dimensions.

443
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,700
And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3D rotation.

444
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,185
I mean, if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i, 

445
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:48,980
j, and k, it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position.

446
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,420
So the way that this works is slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product.

447
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,233
It involves a process called conjugation, and I'll make a full follow-on 

448
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:00,580
video all about it so that we have the time to go through some examples.

449
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,137
In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation 

450
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:10,254
to orientation in 3D space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you 

451
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:14,420
are familiar with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video.

452
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,540
Link in the description.

453
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,769
If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it with some friends, 

454
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:24,134
and if you felt like the narrative structure here was actually helpful for understanding, 

455
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,450
maybe reassure those friends who would be turned off by a large timestamp that good math 

456
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,760
is actually worth the time.

457
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,480
And many thanks to the patrons among you.

458
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,665
I actually spent way longer than I care to admit on this project, 

459
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:39,140
so your patience and support is especially appreciated this time around.
