1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
Suppose you love math, and you had to choose just one proof to show someone to explain

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,120
why it is that math is beautiful, something that can be appreciated by anyone from a wide

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,520
range of backgrounds while still capturing the spirit of progress and cleverness in math.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,600
What would you choose?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,600
After I put out a video on Feynman's Lost Lecture about why planets orbit in ellipses,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,380
published as a guest video over on MinutePhysics, someone on Reddit asked about why the definition

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,420
of an ellipse given in that video, the classic two thumbtacks and a piece of string construction,

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,740
is the same as the definition involving slicing a cone.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,700
Well, my friend, you've asked about one of my all-time favorite proofs, a lovely bit

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,500
of 3D geometry which, despite requiring almost no background, still captures the spirit of

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,940
mathematical inventiveness.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,700
For context and to make sure we're all on the same page, there are at least three main

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,900
ways you could define an ellipse geometrically.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,500
One is to say you take a circle and stretch it out in one dimension, for example, maybe

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,220
you consider all the points as xy coordinates, and you multiply the x-coordinate by some

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,100
special factor for all the points.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,980
Another is the classic two thumbtacks and a piece of string construction, where you

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,740
loop a string around two thumbtacks stuck into a piece of paper, pull it taut with a

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,420
pencil, and trace around, keeping the string taut the whole time.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,140
What you're drawing by doing this is the set of all points so that the sum of the distances

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,900
from each pencil point to the two thumbtack points stays constant.

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,700
Those two thumbtack points are each called a focus of the ellipse, and what we're saying

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,180
here is that this constant focal sum property can be used to define what an ellipse even

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,340
is.

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,980
And yet another way to define an ellipse is to slice a cone with a plane at an angle,

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,460
an angle that's smaller than the slope of the cone itself.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,780
The curve of points where this plane and the cone intersect forms an ellipse, which is

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,940
why you'll often hear ellipses referred to as a conic section.

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,100
Of course, an ellipse is not just one curve, it's a family of curves, ranging from a

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,500
perfect circle up to something that's infinitely stretched.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,020
The specific shape of an ellipse is typically quantified with a number called its eccentricity,

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,340
which I sometimes just read in my head as squishification.

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,860
A circle has eccentricity 0, and the more squished the ellipse is, the closer its eccentricity

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,980
is to the number 1.

35
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,860
For example, Earth's orbit has an eccentricity 0.0167, very low squishification, meaning

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,160
it's really close to just being a circle, while Halley's comet has an orbit with eccentricity

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,580
0.9671, very high squishification.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,620
In the thumbtack definition of an ellipse, based on the constant sum of the distances

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,860
from each point to the two foci, this eccentricity is determined by how far apart the two thumbtacks

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
are.

41
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,780
Specifically, it's the distance between the foci divided by the length of the longest

42
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,900
axis of the ellipse.

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,620
For slicing a cone, the eccentricity is determined by the slope of the plane you used for the

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,620
slicing.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,420
And you might justifiably ask, especially if you're a certain reddit user, why on

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,660
Earth should these three definitions have anything to do with each other?

47
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,660
I mean, sure, it kind of makes sense that each should produce some vaguely oval-looking

48
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,320
stretched out loop, but why should the family of curves produced by these three totally

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,540
different methods be precisely the same shapes?

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,260
In particular, when I was younger I remember feeling really surprised that slicing a cone

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,620
would produce such a symmetric shape.

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,620
You might think that the part of the intersection farther down would kind of bulge out and produce

53
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,100
a more lopsided egg shape.

54
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,940
But nope, the intersection curve is an ellipse, the same evidently symmetric curve you'd

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,200
get by just stretching a circle or tracing around two thumbtacks.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,920
But of course, math is all about proofs, so how do you give an airtight demonstration

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,900
that these three families of curves are actually the same?

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,200
For example, let's focus our attention on just one of these equivalences, namely that

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,040
slicing a cone will give us a curve that could also be drawn using the thumbtack construction.

60
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,040
What you need to show here is that there exist two thumbtack points somewhere inside that

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,820
slicing plane, such that the sum of the distances from any point of the intersection curve to

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,280
those two points remains constant, no matter where you are on that intersection curve.

63
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,320
I first saw the trick to showing why this is true in Paul Lockhart's magnificent book

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,600
Measurement, which I would highly recommend to anyone, young or old, who needs a reminder

65
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,520
of the fact that math is a form of art.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,160
The stroke of genius comes in the very first step, which is to introduce two spheres into

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,160
this picture, one above the plane and one below it, each one of them sized just right,

68
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,360
so as to be tangent to the cone along a circle of points, and tangent to the plane at just

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
a single point.

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,800
Why you would think to do this, of all things, is a tricky question to answer, and one that

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
we'll turn back to.

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,100
For right now, let's just say that you have a particularly playful mind that loves engaging

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,480
with how different geometric objects all fit together.

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,680
But once these spheres are sitting here, I actually bet that you could prove the target

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
result yourself.

76
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,420
Here, I'll help you step through it, but at any point if you feel inspired, please

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,600
do pause and try to carry on without me.

78
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,400
First off, these spheres have introduced two special points inside the curve, the points

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
where they're tangent to the plane.

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,320
So a reasonable guess might be that these two tangency points are the focus points.

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,840
That means that you're going to want to draw lines from these foci to some point along

82
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,880
the ellipse, and ultimately the goal is to understand what the sum of the distances of

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,960
those two lines is, or at the very least to understand why that sum doesn't depend on

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,520
where you are along the ellipse.

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,820
Keep in mind, what makes these lines special is that each one does not simply touch one

86
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,160
of the spheres, it's actually tangent to that sphere at the point where it touches.

87
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,640
And in general, for any math problem, you want to use the defining features of all the

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,560
objects involved.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
Another example here is what even defines the spheres.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,820
It's not just the fact that they're tangent to the plane, but that they're also tangent

91
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,180
to the cone, each one at some circle of tangency points.

92
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,180
So you're going to need to use those two circles of tangency points in some way.

93
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,280
But how exactly?

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,660
One thing you might do is just draw a line straight from the top circle down to the bottom

95
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,100
one along the cone.

96
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,800
And there's something about doing this that feels vaguely reminiscent of the constant

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,460
sum thumbtack property, and hence promising.

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,700
You see, it passes through the ellipse, and so by snipping that line at the point where

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,280
it crosses the ellipse, you can think of it as the sum of two line segments, each one

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,980
hitting the same point on the ellipse.

101
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,980
And you can do this through various different points of the ellipse, depending on where

102
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:09,060
you are around the cone, always getting two line segments with a constant sum, namely

103
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,520
whatever the straight line distance from the top circle to the bottom circle is.

104
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,080
So you see what I mean about it being vaguely analogous to the thumbtack property, in that

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,600
every point of the ellipse gives us two distances whose sum is a constant.

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,680
Granted, these lengths are not to the focal points, they're to the big and the little

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,680
circle, but maybe that leads you to making the following conjecture.

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,560
The distance from a given point on this ellipse, this intersection curve, straight down to

109
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,480
the big circle is, you conjecture, equal to the distance to the point where that big sphere

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,560
is tangent to the plane, our first proposed focus point.

111
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,680
Likewise, perhaps the distance from that point on the ellipse to the small circle is equal

112
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,020
to the distance from that point to the second proposed focus point, where the small sphere

113
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,160
touches the plane.

114
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,320
So is that true?

115
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,160
Well, yes!

116
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,760
Here let's give a name to that point we have on the ellipse, q.

117
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,480
The key is that the line from q to the first proposed focus is tangent to the big sphere,

118
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,400
and the line from q straight down along the cone is also tangent to the big sphere.

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
Here let's look at a different picture for some clarity.

120
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,720
If you have multiple lines drawn from a common point to a sphere, all of which are tangent

121
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,640
to that sphere, you can probably see, just from the symmetry of the setup, that all of

122
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,080
these lines have to have the same length.

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,560
In fact, I encourage you to try proving this yourself, or to otherwise pause and ponder

124
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,480
on the proof I've left on the screen.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,960
But looking back at our cone-slicing setup, your conjecture would be correct.

126
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,040
The two lines extending from the point q on the ellipse tangent to the big sphere have

127
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,360
the same length.

128
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,440
Similarly, the line from q to the second proposed focus point is tangent to the little sphere,

129
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,360
as is the line from q straight up along the cone, so those two also have the same length.

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,800
And so, the sum of the distances from q to the two proposed focus points is the same

131
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,840
as the straight line distance from the little circle down to the big circle along the cone,

132
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
passing through q.

133
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,280
And clearly, that does not depend on which point of the ellipse you chose for q.

134
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,760
Bada-boom-bada-bang, slicing the cone is the same as the thumbtack construction, since

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,480
the resulting curve has the constant focal sum property.

136
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:40,160
This proof was first found by Germenal Dandelin, a guy named Dandelin in 1822, so these two

137
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,560
spheres are sometimes called Dandelin spheres.

138
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,760
You can also use the same trick to show why slicing a cylinder at an angle will give you

139
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,920
an ellipse, and if you're comfortable with the claim that projecting a shape from one

140
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,640
plane onto another tilted plane has the effect of simply stretching out that shape, this

141
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,520
also shows why the definition of an ellipse as a stretched circle is the same as the other

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
two.

143
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,760
More homework!

144
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,880
So why do I think this proof is such a good representative for math itself, that if you

145
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,660
had to show just one thing to explain to a non-math enthusiast why you love the subject,

146
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,060
why this would be a good candidate?

147
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,960
The obvious reason is that it's substantive and beautiful without requiring too much background.

148
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,120
But more than that, it reflects a common feature of math that sometimes there is no

149
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,760
single most fundamental way of defining something, that what matters more is showing equivalences.

150
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,280
And even more than that, the proof itself involves one key moment of creative construction,

151
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,760
adding the two spheres, while most of it leaves room for a nice systematic and principled

152
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
approach.

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,160
And this kind of creative construction is, I think, one of the most thought-provoking

154
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,960
aspects of mathematical discovery, and you might understandably ask where such an idea

155
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
comes from.

156
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,560
In fact, talking about this particular proof, here's what Paul Lockhart says in Measurement.

157
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,400
How do people come up with such ingenious arguments?

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,360
It's the same as the way people come up with Madame Bovary or Mona Lisa.

159
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,220
I have no idea how it happens.

160
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,240
I only know that when it happens to me, I feel very fortunate.

161
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,780
I agree, but I do think we can say at least a little something more about this.

162
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,120
While it is ingenious, we can perhaps decompose how someone who has immersed themselves in

163
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,100
a number of other geometry problems might be particularly primed to think of adding

164
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,900
these specific spheres.

165
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,820
First, a common tactic in geometry is to relate one length to another.

166
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,860
And in this problem, you know from the outset that being able to relate these two lengths

167
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,780
to the foci to some other two lengths, especially ones that line up, would be a useful thing,

168
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,520
even though at the start you don't even know where the focus points are.

169
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,780
And even if it's not clear exactly how you'd do that, throwing spheres into the picture

170
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,540
isn't all that crazy.

171
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,860
Again, if you've built up a relationship with geometry through practice, you would

172
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,920
be well acquainted with how relating one length to another happens all the time when circles

173
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,980
and spheres are in the picture, because it cuts straight to the defining feature of what

174
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,740
it even means to be a circle or a sphere.

175
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,860
This is obviously a very specific example, but the point I want to make is that you can

176
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,140
often view glimpses of ingeniousness not as inexplicable miracles, but as the residue

177
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,340
of experience.

178
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,700
And when you do, the idea of genius goes from being mesmerizing to instead being actively

179
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
inspirational.
