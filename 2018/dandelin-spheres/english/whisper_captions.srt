1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,520
Suppose you love math, and you had to choose just one proof to show someone to explain

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,140
why it is that math is beautiful, something that can be appreciated by anyone from a wide

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,900
range of backgrounds while still capturing the spirit of progress and cleverness in math.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,120
What would you choose?

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,320
After I put out a video on Feynman's Lost Lecture about why planets orbit in ellipses,

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,320
published as a guest video over on MinutePhysics, someone on Reddit asked about why the definition

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,880
of an ellipse given in that video, the classic two thumbtacks and a piece of string construction,

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,300
is the same as the definition involving slicing a cone.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,700
Well, my friend, you've asked about one of my all-time favorite proofs, a lovely bit

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,580
of 3D geometry which, despite requiring almost no background, still captures the spirit of

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,760
mathematical inventiveness.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,720
For context and to make sure we're all on the same page, there are at least three main

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,000
ways you could define an ellipse geometrically.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,220
One is to say you take a circle and stretch it out in one dimension.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,600
For example, maybe you consider all of the points as xy coordinates, and you multiply

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,840
just the x coordinate by some special factor for all the points.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,040
Another is the classic two thumbtacks and a piece of string construction, where you

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,860
loop a string around two thumbtacks stuck into a piece of paper, pull it taut with a

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,600
pencil, and trace around, keeping the string taut the whole time.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,860
What you're drawing by doing this is the set of all points so that the sum of the distances

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,700
from each pencil point to the two thumbtack points stays constant.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,720
Those two thumbtack points are each called a focus of the ellipse, and what we're saying

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,480
here is that this constant focal sum property can be used to define what an ellipse even is.

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,420
And yet another way to define an ellipse is to slice a cone with a plane at an angle,

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,620
an angle that's smaller than the slope of the cone itself.

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,820
The curve of points where this plane and the cone intersect forms an ellipse, which is

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,660
why you'll often hear ellipses referred to as a conic section.

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,200
Of course, an ellipse is not just one curve, it's a family of curves, ranging from a

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,860
perfect circle up to something that's infinitely stretched.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,540
The specific shape of an ellipse is typically quantified with a number called its eccentricity,

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,580
which I sometimes just read in my head as squishification.

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,940
A circle has eccentricity 0, and the more squished the ellipse is, the closer its eccentricity

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,960
is to the number 1.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,780
For example, Earth's orbit has an eccentricity 0.0167, very low squishification, meaning

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,360
it's really close to just being a circle, while Halley's comet has an orbit with eccentricity

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,980
0.9671, very high squishification.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,560
In the thumbtack definition of an ellipse, based on the constant sum of the distances

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,600
from each point to the two foci, this eccentricity is determined by how far apart the two thumbtacks

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,280
are.

40
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,780
Specifically, it's the distance between the foci divided by the length of the longest

41
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,320
axis of the ellipse.

42
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,700
For slicing a cone, the eccentricity is determined by the slope of the plane you used for the

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,060
slicing.

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,590
And you might justifiably ask, especially if you're a certain reddit user, why on

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,550
Earth should these three definitions have anything to do with each other?

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,730
I mean, sure, it kind of makes sense that each should produce some vaguely oval-looking

47
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,330
stretched out loop, but why should the family of curves produced by these three totally

48
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,610
different methods be precisely the same shapes?

49
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,930
In particular, when I was younger I remember feeling really surprised that slicing a cone

50
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,050
would produce such a symmetric shape.

51
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,650
You might think that the part of the intersection farther down would kind of bulge out and produce

52
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,250
a more lopsided egg shape.

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,830
But nope, the intersection curve is an ellipse, the same evidently symmetric curve you'd

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,030
get by just stretching a circle or tracing around two thumbtacks.

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,510
But of course, math is all about proofs, so how do you give an airtight demonstration

56
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,750
that these three families of curves are actually the same?

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,230
For example, let's focus our attention on just one of these equivalences, namely that

58
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,070
slicing a cone will give us a curve that could also be drawn using the thumbtack construction.

59
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,090
What you need to show here is that there exist two thumbtack points somewhere inside that

60
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,750
slicing plane such that the sum of the distances from any point of the intersection curve to

61
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,410
those two points remains constant, no matter where you are on that intersection curve.

62
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,390
I first saw the trick to showing why this is true in Paul Lockhart's magnificent book

63
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,570
Measurement, which I would highly recommend to anyone young or old who needs a reminder

64
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,670
of the fact that math is a form of art.

65
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,190
The stroke of genius comes in the very first step, which is to introduce two spheres into

66
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,810
this picture, one above the plane and one below it, each one of them sized just right

67
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,390
so as to be tangent to the cone along a circle of points, and tangent to the plane at just

68
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,350
a single point.

69
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,830
Why you would think to do this, of all things, is a tricky question to answer, and one that

70
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,730
we'll turn back to.

71
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,090
For right now, let's just say that you have a particularly playful mind that loves engaging

72
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,710
with how different geometric objects all fit together.

73
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,730
But once these spheres are sitting here, I actually bet that you could prove the target

74
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,590
result yourself.

75
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,490
Here, I'll help you step through it, but at any point if you feel inspired, please

76
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,750
do pause and try to carry on without me.

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,350
First off, these spheres have introduced two special points inside the curve, the points

78
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,790
where they're tangent to the plane.

79
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,270
So a reasonable guess might be that these two tangency points are the focus points.

80
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,770
That means that you're going to want to draw lines from these foci to some point along

81
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,890
the ellipse, and ultimately the goal is to understand what the sum of the distances of

82
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:54,010
those two lines is, or at the very least to understand why that sum doesn't depend on

83
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,970
where you are along the ellipse.

84
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,850
Keep in mind, what makes these lines special is that each one does not simply touch one

85
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,130
of the spheres, it's actually tangent to that sphere at the point where it touches.

86
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,690
And in general, for any math problem, you want to use the defining features of all the

87
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,630
objects involved.

88
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,330
Another example here is what even defines the spheres.

89
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,850
It's not just the fact that they're tangent to the plane, but that they're also tangent

90
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,490
to the cone, each one at some circle of tangency points.

91
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,470
So you're going to need to use those two circles of tangency points in some way.

92
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,450
But how exactly?

93
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,670
One thing you might do is just draw a line straight from the top circle down to the bottom

94
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,170
one along the cone.

95
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,750
And there's something about doing this that feels vaguely reminiscent of the constant

96
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,230
sum thumbtack property, and hence promising.

97
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,710
You see, it passes through the ellipse, and so by snipping that line at the point where

98
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,330
it crosses the ellipse, you can think of it as the sum of two line segments, each one

99
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,370
hitting the same point on the ellipse.

100
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,010
And you can do this through various different points of the ellipse, depending on where

101
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,950
you are around the cone, always getting two line segments with a constant sum, namely

102
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,570
whatever the straight line distance from the top circle to the bottom circle is.

103
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,030
So you see what I mean about it being vaguely analogous to the thumbtack property, in that

104
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,110
every point of the ellipse gives us two distances whose sum is a constant.

105
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,390
Granted, these lengths are not to the focal points, they're to the big and the little

106
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,890
circle, but maybe that leads you to making the following conjecture.

107
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,650
The distance from a given point on this ellipse, this intersection curve, straight down to

108
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,390
the big circle is, you conjecture, equal to the distance to the point where that big sphere

109
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,070
is tangent to the plane, our first proposed focus point.

110
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,690
Likewise, perhaps the distance from that point on the ellipse to the small circle is equal

111
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,050
to the distance from that point to the second proposed focus point, where the small sphere

112
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,950
touches the plane.

113
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,890
So is that true?

114
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,550
Well, yes!

115
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,010
Here, let's give a name to that point we have on the ellipse, q.

116
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,810
The key is that the line from q to the first proposed focus is tangent to the big sphere,

117
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,550
and the line from q straight down along the cone is also tangent to the big sphere.

118
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,350
Here, let's look at a different picture for some clarity.

119
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,730
If you have multiple lines drawn from a common point to a sphere, all of which are tangent

120
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,650
to that sphere, you can probably see, just from the symmetry of the setup, that all of

121
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,870
these lines have to have the same length.

122
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,590
In fact, I encourage you to try proving this yourself, or to otherwise pause and ponder

123
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,130
on the proof I've left on the screen.

124
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,470
But, looking back at our cone slicing setup, your conjecture would be correct.

125
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,090
The two lines extending from the point q on the ellipse tangent to the big sphere have

126
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,970
the same length.

127
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,990
Similarly, the line from q to the second proposed focus point is tangent to the little sphere,

128
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,510
as is the line from q straight up along the cone, so those two also have the same length.

129
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,690
And so, the sum of the distances from q to the two proposed focus points is the same

130
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,550
as the straight line distance from the little circle down to the big circle along the cone,

131
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,570
passing through q.

132
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,010
And clearly, that does not depend on which point of the ellipse you chose for q.

133
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,790
Bada-boom-bada-bang, slicing the cone is the same as the thumbtack construction, since

134
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,430
the resulting curve has the constant focal sum property.

135
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:37,010
Now this proof was first found by Germenal, Germenal, Germenal, who cares, Dandelin, a

136
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,630
guy named Dandelin in 1822, so these two spheres are sometimes called Dandelin spheres.

137
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,870
You can also use the same trick to show why slicing a cylinder at an angle will give you

138
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,090
an ellipse, and if you're comfortable with the claim that projecting a shape from one

139
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,710
plane onto another tilted plane has the effect of simply stretching out that shape, this

140
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,430
also shows why the definition of an ellipse as a stretched circle is the same as the other

141
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,830
two.

142
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,010
More homework.

143
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,050
So why do I think this proof is such a good representative for math itself?

144
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,690
That if you had to show just one thing to explain to a non-math enthusiast why you love

145
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,090
the subject, why this would be a good candidate.

146
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,310
The obvious reason is that it's substantive and beautiful without requiring too much background,

147
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,670
but more than that, it reflects a common feature of math that sometimes there is no single

148
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,950
most fundamental way of defining something, that what matters more is showing equivalences.

149
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,810
And even more than that, the proof itself involves one key moment of creative construction,

150
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,730
adding the two spheres, while most of it leaves room for a nice systematic and principled

151
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,230
approach.

152
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,170
And this kind of creative construction is, I think, one of the most thought-provoking

153
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,970
aspects of mathematical discovery, and you might understandably ask where such an idea

154
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,650
comes from.

155
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,450
In fact, talking about this particular proof, here's what Paul Lockhart says in Measurement.

156
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:16,310
I agree, but I think we can say at least a little something more about this.

157
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,170
While it is ingenious, we can perhaps decompose how someone who has immersed themselves in

158
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,970
a number of other geometry problems might be particularly primed to think of adding

159
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,350
these specific spheres.

160
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,710
First, a common tactic in geometry is to relate one length to another, and in this problem,

161
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,410
you know from the outset that being able to relate these two lengths to the foci to some

162
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,550
other two lengths, especially ones that line up, would be a useful thing, even though at

163
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,230
the start you don't even know where the focus points are.

164
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,830
And even if it's not clear exactly how you'd do that, throwing spheres into the picture

165
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,030
isn't all that crazy.

166
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,890
Again, if you've built up a relationship with geometry through practice, you would

167
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,910
be well acquainted with how relating one length to another happens all the time when the circles

168
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,990
and spheres are in the picture, because it cuts straight to the defining feature of what

169
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,050
it even means to be a circle or a sphere.

170
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,230
This is obviously a specific example, but the point I want to make is that you can often

171
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,030
view glimpses of ingeniousness not as inexplicable miracles, but as the residue of experience.

172
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,550
And when you do, the idea of genius goes from being mesmerizing to instead being actively

173
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,370
inspirational.
