1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,465
Suppose you love math, and you had to choose just one proof to show someone to explain 

2
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:13,209
why it is that math is beautiful, something that can be appreciated by anyone from a wide 

3
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,900
range of backgrounds while still capturing the spirit of progress and cleverness in math.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,120
What would you choose?

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,484
After I put out a video on Feynman's Lost Lecture about why planets orbit in ellipses, 

6
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:27,027
published as a guest video over on MinutePhysics, 

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,299
someone on Reddit asked about why the definition of an ellipse given in that video, 

8
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:34,502
the classic two thumbtacks and a piece of string construction, 

9
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:37,300
is the same as the definition involving slicing a cone.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,539
Well, my friend, you've asked about one of my all-time favorite proofs, 

11
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,100
a lovely bit of 3D geometry which, despite requiring almost no background, 

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,760
still captures the spirit of mathematical inventiveness.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,437
For context and to make sure we're all on the same page, 

14
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:55,000
there are at least three main ways you could define an ellipse geometrically.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,220
One is to say you take a circle and stretch it out in one dimension.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,552
For example, maybe you consider all of the points as xy coordinates, 

17
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:07,840
and you multiply just the x coordinate by some special factor for all the points.

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,888
Another is the classic two thumbtacks and a piece of string construction, 

19
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:16,972
where you loop a string around two thumbtacks stuck into a piece of paper, 

20
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:21,600
pull it taut with a pencil, and trace around, keeping the string taut the whole time.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,869
What you're drawing by doing this is the set of all points so that the sum of 

22
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,700
the distances from each pencil point to the two thumbtack points stays constant.

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,025
Those two thumbtack points are each called a focus of the ellipse, 

24
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,848
and what we're saying here is that this constant focal sum 

25
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,480
property can be used to define what an ellipse even is.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,623
And yet another way to define an ellipse is to slice a cone with a plane at an angle, 

27
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:49,620
an angle that's smaller than the slope of the cone itself.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,647
The curve of points where this plane and the cone intersect forms an ellipse, 

29
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:58,660
which is why you'll often hear ellipses referred to as a conic section.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,273
Of course, an ellipse is not just one curve, it's a family of curves, 

31
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:06,860
ranging from a perfect circle up to something that's infinitely stretched.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,582
The specific shape of an ellipse is typically quantified with a number called 

33
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:15,580
its eccentricity, which I sometimes just read in my head as squishification.

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,148
A circle has eccentricity 0, and the more squished the ellipse is, 

35
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:22,960
the closer its eccentricity is to the number 1.

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,914
For example, Earth's orbit has an eccentricity 0.0167, very low squishification, 

37
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:33,615
meaning it's really close to just being a circle, 

38
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:39,980
while Halley's comet has an orbit with eccentricity 0.9671, very high squishification.

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,129
In the thumbtack definition of an ellipse, based on the constant 

40
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,193
sum of the distances from each point to the two foci, 

41
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:51,280
this eccentricity is determined by how far apart the two thumbtacks are.

42
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,695
Specifically, it's the distance between the foci 

43
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:58,320
divided by the length of the longest axis of the ellipse.

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,240
For slicing a cone, the eccentricity is determined 

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,060
by the slope of the plane you used for the slicing.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,735
And you might justifiably ask, especially if you're a certain reddit user, 

47
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:14,550
why on Earth should these three definitions have anything to do with each other?

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,260
I mean, sure, it kind of makes sense that each should produce some vaguely 

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,661
oval-looking stretched out loop, but why should the family of curves produced 

50
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,610
by these three totally different methods be precisely the same shapes?

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,536
In particular, when I was younger I remember feeling really 

52
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:35,050
surprised that slicing a cone would produce such a symmetric shape.

53
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,926
You might think that the part of the intersection farther down 

54
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:42,250
would kind of bulge out and produce a more lopsided egg shape.

55
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,523
But nope, the intersection curve is an ellipse, 

56
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:49,471
the same evidently symmetric curve you'd get by just stretching a circle or 

57
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,030
tracing around two thumbtacks.

58
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,900
But of course, math is all about proofs, so how do you give an airtight 

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,750
demonstration that these three families of curves are actually the same?

60
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,546
For example, let's focus our attention on just one of these equivalences, 

61
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:08,871
namely that slicing a cone will give us a curve that could also be drawn using the 

62
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,070
thumbtack construction.

63
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,443
What you need to show here is that there exist two thumbtack points somewhere inside that 

64
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:21,957
slicing plane such that the sum of the distances from any point of the intersection curve 

65
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:27,410
to those two points remains constant, no matter where you are on that intersection curve.

66
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,571
I first saw the trick to showing why this is true in Paul Lockhart's 

67
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,071
magnificent book Measurement, which I would highly recommend to anyone 

68
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:38,670
young or old who needs a reminder of the fact that math is a form of art.

69
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,588
The stroke of genius comes in the very first step, 

70
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,745
which is to introduce two spheres into this picture, 

71
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:50,035
one above the plane and one below it, each one of them sized just right 

72
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:53,490
so as to be tangent to the cone along a circle of points, 

73
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,350
and tangent to the plane at just a single point.

74
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,478
Why you would think to do this, of all things, 

75
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:04,730
is a tricky question to answer, and one that we'll turn back to.

76
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,324
For right now, let's just say that you have a particularly playful mind 

77
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:11,710
that loves engaging with how different geometric objects all fit together.

78
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,010
But once these spheres are sitting here, I actually 

79
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,590
bet that you could prove the target result yourself.

80
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,365
Here, I'll help you step through it, but at any point if you feel inspired, 

81
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,750
please do pause and try to carry on without me.

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,178
First off, these spheres have introduced two special points inside the curve, 

83
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,790
the points where they're tangent to the plane.

84
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,270
So a reasonable guess might be that these two tangency points are the focus points.

85
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,652
That means that you're going to want to draw lines from these foci to some 

86
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:47,010
point along the ellipse, and ultimately the goal is to understand what 

87
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,955
the sum of the distances of those two lines is, 

88
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:54,374
or at the very least to understand why that sum doesn't depend on where 

89
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:55,970
you are along the ellipse.

90
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,744
Keep in mind, what makes these lines special is that each one does not simply touch 

91
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:07,130
one of the spheres, it's actually tangent to that sphere at the point where it touches.

92
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,711
And in general, for any math problem, you want to 

93
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:13,630
use the defining features of all the objects involved.

94
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,330
Another example here is what even defines the spheres.

95
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,975
It's not just the fact that they're tangent to the plane, 

96
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:25,490
but that they're also tangent to the cone, each one at some circle of tangency points.

97
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,470
So you're going to need to use those two circles of tangency points in some way.

98
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,450
But how exactly?

99
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,980
One thing you might do is just draw a line straight from 

100
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,170
the top circle down to the bottom one along the cone.

101
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,377
And there's something about doing this that feels vaguely reminiscent 

102
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:47,230
of the constant sum thumbtack property, and hence promising.

103
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,181
You see, it passes through the ellipse, and so by snipping that line 

104
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:55,189
at the point where it crosses the ellipse, you can think of it as the 

105
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,370
sum of two line segments, each one hitting the same point on the ellipse.

106
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,349
And you can do this through various different points of the ellipse, 

107
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:07,535
depending on where you are around the cone, always getting two line segments with a 

108
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:11,722
constant sum, namely whatever the straight line distance from the top circle to the 

109
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,570
bottom circle is.

110
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,627
So you see what I mean about it being vaguely analogous to the thumbtack property, 

111
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:22,110
in that every point of the ellipse gives us two distances whose sum is a constant.

112
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,346
Granted, these lengths are not to the focal points, 

113
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:28,776
they're to the big and the little circle, but maybe that leads you to making 

114
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:29,890
the following conjecture.

115
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,100
The distance from a given point on this ellipse, this intersection curve, 

116
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,242
straight down to the big circle is, you conjecture, 

117
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,197
equal to the distance to the point where that big sphere is tangent to the plane, 

118
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,070
our first proposed focus point.

119
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,943
Likewise, perhaps the distance from that point on the ellipse to 

120
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:52,317
the small circle is equal to the distance from that point to the 

121
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:55,950
second proposed focus point, where the small sphere touches the plane.

122
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,890
So is that true?

123
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,550
Well, yes!

124
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,010
Here, let's give a name to that point we have on the ellipse, q.

125
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,867
The key is that the line from q to the first proposed focus is tangent to the big sphere, 

126
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:14,550
and the line from q straight down along the cone is also tangent to the big sphere.

127
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,350
Here, let's look at a different picture for some clarity.

128
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,500
If you have multiple lines drawn from a common point to a sphere, 

129
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,946
all of which are tangent to that sphere, you can probably see, 

130
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:30,870
just from the symmetry of the setup, that all of these lines have to have the same length.

131
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,050
In fact, I encourage you to try proving this yourself, 

132
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,130
or to otherwise pause and ponder on the proof I've left on the screen.

133
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,470
But, looking back at our cone slicing setup, your conjecture would be correct.

134
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,787
The two lines extending from the point q on the 

135
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,970
ellipse tangent to the big sphere have the same length.

136
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,296
Similarly, the line from q to the second proposed focus point 

137
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:59,203
is tangent to the little sphere, as is the line from q straight up along the cone, 

138
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,510
so those two also have the same length.

139
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,021
And so, the sum of the distances from q to the two proposed focus 

140
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:09,825
points is the same as the straight line distance from the little 

141
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:13,570
circle down to the big circle along the cone, passing through q.

142
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,010
And clearly, that does not depend on which point of the ellipse you chose for q.

143
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,377
Bada-boom-bada-bang, slicing the cone is the same as the thumbtack construction, 

144
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:25,430
since the resulting curve has the constant focal sum property.

145
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,041
Now this proof was first found by Germenal, Germenal, Germenal, who cares, Dandelin, 

146
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:42,630
a guy named Dandelin in 1822, so these two spheres are sometimes called Dandelin spheres.

147
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,329
You can also use the same trick to show why slicing a cylinder at an angle will give you 

148
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:52,948
an ellipse, and if you're comfortable with the claim that projecting a shape from one 

149
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:57,459
plane onto another tilted plane has the effect of simply stretching out that shape, 

150
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,292
this also shows why the definition of an ellipse as a stretched circle is the same as the 

151
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:02,830
other two.

152
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,010
More homework.

153
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,050
So why do I think this proof is such a good representative for math itself?

154
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,595
That if you had to show just one thing to explain to a non-math 

155
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:17,090
enthusiast why you love the subject, why this would be a good candidate.

156
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,376
The obvious reason is that it's substantive and beautiful without 

157
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:24,147
requiring too much background, but more than that, 

158
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:28,005
it reflects a common feature of math that sometimes there is no single 

159
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:31,808
most fundamental way of defining something, that what matters more is 

160
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:32,950
showing equivalences.

161
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,305
And even more than that, the proof itself involves one key moment 

162
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:40,075
of creative construction, adding the two spheres, 

163
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:44,230
while most of it leaves room for a nice systematic and principled approach.

164
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,490
And this kind of creative construction is, I think, 

165
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,232
one of the most thought-provoking aspects of mathematical discovery, 

166
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:54,650
and you might understandably ask where such an idea comes from.

167
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,230
In fact, talking about this particular proof, 

168
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,450
here's what Paul Lockhart says in Measurement.

169
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:16,310
I agree, but I think we can say at least a little something more about this.

170
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,081
While it is ingenious, we can perhaps decompose how someone who 

171
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:23,498
has immersed themselves in a number of other geometry problems 

172
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:27,350
might be particularly primed to think of adding these specific spheres.

173
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,089
First, a common tactic in geometry is to relate one length to another, 

174
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,938
and in this problem, you know from the outset that being able to relate these two 

175
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:41,493
lengths to the foci to some other two lengths, especially ones that line up, 

176
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:46,224
would be a useful thing, even though at the start you don't even know where the 

177
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:47,230
focus points are.

178
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,204
And even if it's not clear exactly how you'd do that, 

179
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:54,030
throwing spheres into the picture isn't all that crazy.

180
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,802
Again, if you've built up a relationship with geometry through practice, 

181
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:01,781
you would be well acquainted with how relating one length to another happens 

182
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,985
all the time when the circles and spheres are in the picture, 

183
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:08,964
because it cuts straight to the defining feature of what it even means to be 

184
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:10,050
a circle or a sphere.

185
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,179
This is obviously a specific example, but the point I want to 

186
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:19,161
make is that you can often view glimpses of ingeniousness not as inexplicable miracles, 

187
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:21,030
but as the residue of experience.

188
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,620
And when you do, the idea of genius goes from being 

189
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,550
mesmerizing to instead being actively inspirational.
