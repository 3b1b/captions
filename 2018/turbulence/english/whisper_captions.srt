1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,640
The air around you is in constant and chaotic motion, replete with nearly impossible to

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,440
predict swirls, ranging from large to minuscule.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,520
What you're looking at right now is a cross-section of the flow in a typical room, made visible

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,680
using a home demo involving a laser, a glass rod, and a fog machine.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,780
Predicting the specifics of turbulent motion like this has long evaded mathematicians and

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,260
physicists, but we are steadily getting closer to understanding some consistent patterns

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,100
in this chaos, and in a minute I'll share with you one specific quantitative result

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,760
describing a certain self-similarity to this motion.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,760
To back up a bit, I was recently in San Diego and spent a day with Diana Cowern, aka Physics

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,180
Girl, and her frequent collaborator, Dan Walsh, playing around with vortex rings.

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,040
This is a really surprising fluid flow phenomenon, where a donut-shaped region of fluid stays

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,680
surprisingly stable as it moves through space.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,300
If you take some open container with a lip and fill it with smoke or fog, you can use

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,120
this to actually see the otherwise invisible ring.

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,160
Diana just published a video over on her channel showing much more of that particular demo,

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
including a genuinely fascinating observation about what happens when you change the shape

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,840
of the opening.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,440
The story for you and me starts when her friend Dan had the clever idea to visualize a slice

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,100
of what's going on with these vortex rings using a planar laser.

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,880
So you know how if you shine a laser through the fog, photons will occasionally bounce

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,960
off of the particles in the fog along that beam towards your eye, thereby revealing the

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,720
beam of the laser?

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, Dan's thought was to refract that light through a glass rod so that it was relatively

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,260
evenly spread across an entire plane, then the same phenomenon would reveal the laser

25
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,000
light along a thin plane through that fog.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,020
The result was awesome!

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,340
The cross-section of such a smoke ring looks like two hurricanes rotating next to each

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,180
other, and this makes abundantly clear how the surface of these rings rotates as they

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,200
travel, and also how chaotic they leave the air behind them.

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,760
And, as an added bonus, the setup doubles as a great Death Eater themed Halloween decoration.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,220
If you do want to try this at home, I should say, be super careful with the laser, make

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,740
sure not to point it near anyone's eyes.

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,920
This concern is especially relevant when the laser is spread along a full plane, basically

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
treat it like a gun.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,680
Also, credit where credit is due, I'd like to point out that after we did this we found

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,200
that the channel Nighthawk and Light has a video doing a similar demo, link in the

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,580
description.

38
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,260
Even though our original plan was to illuminate vortex rings, I actually think the most notable

39
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,660
part of this visual is how it sheds light on what ordinary airflow in a room looks like,

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,520
in all of its intricacy and detail.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,040
We call this chaotic flow turbulence, and just as vortex rings give an example of unexpected

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,500
order in the otherwise messy world of fluid dynamics, I'd like to share with you a more

43
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,040
subtle instance of order amidst chaos in the math of turbulence.

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,620
First off, what exactly is turbulence?

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,240
The term is familiar to many of us as that annoying thing that makes plane rides bumpy,

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,540
but nailing down a specific definition is a little tricky.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,100
It's easiest to describe qualitatively.

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Turbulence involves many swirling eddies, it's chaotic, and it mixes things together.

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,660
One approach here would be to describe turbulence based on what it's not, laminar flow.

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,200
This term stems from the same Latin word that lamination does lamina, meaning a thin layer

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,260
of a material, and it refers to smooth flow in a fluid, where the moving particles stay

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,320
largely confined to distinct layers.

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,380
Turbulence, in contrast, contains many eddies, points of some vorticity, also known as positive

54
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,800
curl, also known as a high swirly swirly factor, breaking down the notion of distinct layers.

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,680
However, vorticity does not necessarily imply that a flow is turbulent.

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,600
Patterns like whirlpools or even smoke rings have high vorticity since the fluid is rotating,

57
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,060
but can nevertheless be smooth and predictable.

58
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,600
Instead, turbulence is further characterized as being chaotic, meaning small changes to

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,520
the initial conditions result in large changes to the ensuing patterns.

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,700
It's also diffusive in the sense of mixing together different parts of the fluid, and

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,040
diffusing the energy and momentum from isolated parts of the fluid to the rest.

62
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,980
Notice how in this clip, over time, the image shifts from having a crisp delineation between

63
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,080
fog and air to instead being a murky mixture of both of them.

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
As to something more mathematically precise, there's not really a single widely agreed

65
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,860
upon clear-cut criterion the way there is for most other terms in math.

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,360
The intricacy of the patterns you're seeing is mirrored by a difficulty to parse the physics

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
describing all of this, and that can make the notion of a rigorous definition somewhat

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,140
slippery.

69
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,380
You see, the fundamental equations describing fluid dynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations,

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,940
are famously challenging to understand.

71
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,360
We won't go through the full details here, but if you're curious, the main equation

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,860
is essentially a form of Newton's second law, that the acceleration of a body times

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,440
its mass equals the sum of the forces acting on it.

74
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,520
It's just that writing mass times acceleration looks a bit more complicated in this context,

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,080
and the force is broken down into the different types of forces acting on a fluid, which again

76
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,620
can look a bit intimidating in the context of continuum dynamics.

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,820
Not only are these hard to solve in the sense of feeding in some initial state of a fluid

78
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,620
and figuring out how the equations predict that fluid will evolve, there are several

79
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,300
unsolved problems around a much more modest task of understanding whether or not quote-unquote

80
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,600
reasonable solutions will always exist.

81
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,980
Reasonable here means things like not blowing up to a point of having infinite kinetic energy,

82
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,860
and that smooth initial states yield smooth solutions, where the word smooth carries with

83
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,060
it a very precise meaning in this context.

84
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,920
The questions formalizing the idea of these equations predicting reasonable behavior actually

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,560
have a $1 million prize associated with them.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,100
And all of that is just for the case of incompressible fluid flow, where something compressible like

87
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,060
air makes things trickier still.

88
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,220
And the heart of the difficulty, both for the specific solutions and the general theoretical

89
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,580
results surrounding them, is that tricky-to-pin-down phenomenon of turbulence.

90
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
But we're not completely in the dark.

91
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,060
The hard work of a lot of smart people throughout history has led us to understanding some of

92
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,860
the patterns underlying this chaos, and I'd like to share with you one found by the 19th

93
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,660
century mathematician Andrei Komagorov.

94
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,840
It has to do with how kinetic energy in turbulent motion is distributed at different length

95
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,260
scales.

96
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,440
In simpler-to-think-about physics, we often think about kinetic energy at two different

97
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,200
length scales, a macroscale, say the energy carried by your moving car, or a molecular

98
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,920
scale, which we call heat.

99
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,860
As you apply your brakes, energy is transferred more or less directly from that macroscale

100
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,460
motion to the molecular scale motion, as your brakes and the surrounding air heats

101
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,460
up, meaning all of their molecules start jiggling even faster.

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Turbulence, on the other hand, is characterized by kinetic energy at a whole spectrum of length

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,020
scales, from the movement of large eddies to smaller ones and smaller ones and smaller

104
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,520
ones still.

105
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,400
Moreover, this energy tends to cascade down the spectrum, where what I mean by that is

106
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,820
that the energy of large eddies gets converted into that of smaller eddies, which in turn

107
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,400
bring about smaller eddies still.

108
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,180
This goes on until it's small enough that the energy dissipates directly to heat in

109
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,040
the fluid, which is to say molecular scale jiggling, due to the fluid's viscosity,

110
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,780
which is to say how much the particles tug at each other.

111
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,640
Or, as this was all phrased in a poem by Lewis F. Richardson,

112
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,720
Big whorls have little whorls which feed on their velocity, and little whorls have lesser

113
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,500
whorls, and so on to viscosity.

114
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,840
Now you might wonder whether more of the kinetic energy of this fluid is carried by all of

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,620
the larger eddies, say all those with diameter 1 meter, or by all of the smaller ones, say

116
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,580
all those with diameter 1 cm, counted together.

117
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,700
Or more generally, if you were to look at all of the swirls with a diameter d, about

118
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,900
how much of the fluid's total energy do they collectively carry?

119
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,340
Is that even an answerable question?

120
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,820
Komagorov hypothesized that the amount of energy in a turbulent flow carried by eddies

121
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,080
with diameter d tends to be proportional to d to the power 5 thirds, at least within a

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,180
specific range of length scales known fancifully as the inertial subrange.

123
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,220
For air, this ranges from about 0.1 cm up to 1 km.

124
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,500
This fact has since been verified by experiment many times over.

125
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,340
It would appear that 5 thirds is a sort of fundamental constant of turbulence.

126
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,580
It's an oddly specific fact, I know, but what I love about the existence of a constant

127
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,380
like this is that it suggests there's some predictability, however slight, to this whole

128
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,800
mass.

129
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,480
There is something ironic about talking about this energy cascade while viewing two-dimensional

130
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,120
slices of a fluid, because it is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon.

131
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,720
While fluid flow in two dimensions can have a sort of turbulence, this energy transfer

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,900
actually tends to go the other way, from the small scales up to larger ones.

133
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,400
So keep in mind, while you're looking at this 2d slice of turbulence, it's actually

134
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,300
very different in character from turbulence in 2d.

135
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,120
One of the mechanisms behind this energy cascade, which could only ever happen in three dimensions,

136
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,680
is a process known as vortex stretching.

137
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,940
A rotating part of the fluid will tend to stretch out perpendicular to the plane of

138
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,500
rotation, resulting in smaller eddies spinning faster.

139
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,580
This transition from energy held in a large vortex to instead being held in smaller vortices

140
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,500
would be impossible if there weren't another dimension to stretch in.

141
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,800
Or if this vortex were bent around to meet itself in a ring shape, in a way it's like

142
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
a vortex which is blocking itself from stretching out this way.

143
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,120
And as mentioned earlier, this is indeed a surprisingly stable configuration for a fluid,

144
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,500
order amidst chaos.

145
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,460
Interestingly though, when we made these vortex rings in practice and followed them over a

146
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,860
long period of time, they do have a tendency to slowly stretch out, albeit at a much longer

147
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,760
time scale than the vortex stretching I was just talking about.

148
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Which brings us back to Diana and Dan.

149
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,500
Huge thanks to the both of them for getting so much footage and making all of this happen.

150
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,280
Make sure to hop over to Physics Girl now to see some of the vortex ring demos, and

151
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,500
as I said, you'll also get to learn about something that happens when you change the

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
shape of the hole in this vortex cannon.

153
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,460
The result and its specifics certainly surprised me, and you'll get to hear it through Diana's

154
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,860
typical, and infectious, superhuman level of enthusiasm.

155
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:27,440
Thanks for watching!
