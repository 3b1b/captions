1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,785
The air around you is in constant and chaotic motion, 

2
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:11,440
replete with nearly impossible to predict swirls, ranging from large to minuscule.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,363
What you're looking at right now is a cross-section of the flow in a typical room, 

4
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:20,680
made visible using a home demo involving a laser, a glass rod, and a fog machine.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,087
Predicting the specifics of turbulent motion like this has long evaded 

6
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:29,398
mathematicians and physicists, but we are steadily getting closer to understanding 

7
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:33,345
some consistent patterns in this chaos, and in a minute I'll share with you 

8
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:37,760
one specific quantitative result describing a certain self-similarity to this motion.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,198
To back up a bit, I was recently in San Diego and spent a day with Diana Cowern, 

10
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:46,412
aka Physics Girl, and her frequent collaborator, Dan Walsh, 

11
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,180
playing around with vortex rings.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,581
This is a really surprising fluid flow phenomenon, 

13
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:56,680
where a donut-shaped region of fluid stays surprisingly stable as it moves through space.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,627
If you take some open container with a lip and fill it with smoke or fog, 

15
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:05,120
you can use this to actually see the otherwise invisible ring.

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,237
Diana just published a video over on her channel showing much more 

17
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:12,815
of that particular demo, including a genuinely fascinating observation 

18
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:15,840
about what happens when you change the shape of the opening.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,681
The story for you and me starts when her friend Dan had the clever idea to 

20
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:25,100
visualize a slice of what's going on with these vortex rings using a planar laser.

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,705
So you know how if you shine a laser through the fog, 

22
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,985
photons will occasionally bounce off of the particles in the fog 

23
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:35,720
along that beam towards your eye, thereby revealing the beam of the laser?

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,744
Well, Dan's thought was to refract that light through a glass rod so that 

25
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:43,910
it was relatively evenly spread across an entire plane, 

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:49,000
then the same phenomenon would reveal the laser light along a thin plane through that fog.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,020
The result was awesome!

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,224
The cross-section of such a smoke ring looks like two hurricanes rotating next 

29
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:04,770
to each other, and this makes abundantly clear how the surface of these rings 

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,199
rotates as they travel, and also how chaotic they leave the air behind them.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,623
And, as an added bonus, the setup doubles as a 

32
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,760
great Death Eater themed Halloween decoration.

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,974
If you do want to try this at home, I should say, 

34
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:27,740
be super careful with the laser, make sure not to point it near anyone's eyes.

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,357
This concern is especially relevant when the laser is spread along a full plane, 

36
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:33,920
basically treat it like a gun.

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,606
Also, credit where credit is due, I'd like to point out that 

38
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:40,446
after we did this we found that the channel Nighthawk and 

39
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:43,580
Light has a video doing a similar demo, link in the description.

40
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,203
Even though our original plan was to illuminate vortex rings, 

41
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:51,888
I actually think the most notable part of this visual is how it sheds 

42
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:56,520
light on what ordinary airflow in a room looks like, in all of its intricacy and detail.

43
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,391
We call this chaotic flow turbulence, and just as vortex rings give an example of 

44
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,839
unexpected order in the otherwise messy world of fluid dynamics, 

45
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:09,031
I'd like to share with you a more subtle instance of order amidst chaos in the 

46
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,040
math of turbulence.

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,620
First off, what exactly is turbulence?

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,647
The term is familiar to many of us as that annoying thing that makes plane rides bumpy, 

49
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:21,540
but nailing down a specific definition is a little tricky.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,100
It's easiest to describe qualitatively.

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Turbulence involves many swirling eddies, it's chaotic, and it mixes things together.

52
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,660
One approach here would be to describe turbulence based on what it's not, laminar flow.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,173
This term stems from the same Latin word that lamination does lamina, 

54
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:43,499
meaning a thin layer of a material, and it refers to smooth flow in a fluid, 

55
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,320
where the moving particles stay largely confined to distinct layers.

56
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,582
Turbulence, in contrast, contains many eddies, points of some vorticity, 

57
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:57,062
also known as positive curl, also known as a high swirly swirly factor, 

58
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,800
breaking down the notion of distinct layers.

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,680
However, vorticity does not necessarily imply that a flow is turbulent.

60
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,326
Patterns like whirlpools or even smoke rings have high vorticity since 

61
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:13,060
the fluid is rotating, but can nevertheless be smooth and predictable.

62
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,267
Instead, turbulence is further characterized as being chaotic, 

63
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:21,589
meaning small changes to the initial conditions result in large changes to the 

64
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,520
ensuing patterns.

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,593
It's also diffusive in the sense of mixing together different parts of the fluid, 

66
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:32,040
and diffusing the energy and momentum from isolated parts of the fluid to the rest.

67
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,104
Notice how in this clip, over time, the image shifts from having a crisp 

68
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:42,080
delineation between fog and air to instead being a murky mixture of both of them.

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,466
As to something more mathematically precise, there's not really a single widely 

70
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:51,860
agreed upon clear-cut criterion the way there is for most other terms in math.

71
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,557
The intricacy of the patterns you're seeing is mirrored by a 

72
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:58,437
difficulty to parse the physics describing all of this, 

73
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:02,140
and that can make the notion of a rigorous definition somewhat slippery.

74
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,320
You see, the fundamental equations describing fluid dynamics, 

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,940
the Navier-Stokes equations, are famously challenging to understand.

76
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,014
We won't go through the full details here, but if you're curious, 

77
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,538
the main equation is essentially a form of Newton's second law, 

78
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:22,440
that the acceleration of a body times its mass equals the sum of the forces acting on it.

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,441
It's just that writing mass times acceleration looks a bit more complicated in this 

80
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:31,949
context, and the force is broken down into the different types of forces acting on 

81
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,620
a fluid, which again can look a bit intimidating in the context of continuum dynamics.

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,631
Not only are these hard to solve in the sense of feeding in some initial state 

83
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:45,690
of a fluid and figuring out how the equations predict that fluid will evolve, 

84
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,332
there are several unsolved problems around a much more modest task of 

85
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:53,600
understanding whether or not quote-unquote reasonable solutions will always exist.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,936
Reasonable here means things like not blowing up to a point of having infinite 

87
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:02,833
kinetic energy, and that smooth initial states yield smooth solutions, 

88
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:07,060
where the word smooth carries with it a very precise meaning in this context.

89
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,471
The questions formalizing the idea of these equations predicting 

90
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,560
reasonable behavior actually have a $1 million prize associated with them.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,556
And all of that is just for the case of incompressible fluid flow, 

92
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:23,060
where something compressible like air makes things trickier still.

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,895
And the heart of the difficulty, both for the specific solutions and the general 

94
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:32,580
theoretical results surrounding them, is that tricky-to-pin-down phenomenon of turbulence.

95
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
But we're not completely in the dark.

96
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,335
The hard work of a lot of smart people throughout history has led us to 

97
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:42,167
understanding some of the patterns underlying this chaos, 

98
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:45,829
and I'd like to share with you one found by the 19th century mathematician 

99
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:46,660
Andrei Komagorov.

100
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,646
It has to do with how kinetic energy in turbulent 

101
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:52,260
motion is distributed at different length scales.

102
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,999
In simpler-to-think-about physics, we often think about kinetic 

103
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,063
energy at two different length scales, a macroscale, 

104
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:06,920
say the energy carried by your moving car, or a molecular scale, which we call heat.

105
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,985
As you apply your brakes, energy is transferred more or less directly from that 

106
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:14,647
macroscale motion to the molecular scale motion, 

107
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,309
as your brakes and the surrounding air heats up, 

108
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:20,460
meaning all of their molecules start jiggling even faster.

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,948
Turbulence, on the other hand, is characterized by kinetic energy 

110
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:28,285
at a whole spectrum of length scales, from the movement of large 

111
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:31,520
eddies to smaller ones and smaller ones and smaller ones still.

112
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,482
Moreover, this energy tends to cascade down the spectrum, 

113
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:39,354
where what I mean by that is that the energy of large eddies gets 

114
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:44,400
converted into that of smaller eddies, which in turn bring about smaller eddies still.

115
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,771
This goes on until it's small enough that the energy dissipates directly 

116
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:52,165
to heat in the fluid, which is to say molecular scale jiggling, 

117
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:56,780
due to the fluid's viscosity, which is to say how much the particles tug at each other.

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Or, as this was all phrased in a poem by Lewis F.

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,280
Richardson, Big whorls have little whorls which feed on their velocity, 

120
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,500
and little whorls have lesser whorls, and so on to viscosity.

121
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,988
Now you might wonder whether more of the kinetic energy of this fluid is 

122
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:17,538
carried by all of the larger eddies, say all those with diameter 1 meter, 

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,580
or by all of the smaller ones, say all those with diameter 1 cm, counted together.

124
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,244
Or more generally, if you were to look at all of the swirls with a diameter d, 

125
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:30,900
about how much of the fluid's total energy do they collectively carry?

126
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,340
Is that even an answerable question?

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,978
Komagorov hypothesized that the amount of energy in a turbulent flow carried by 

128
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,593
eddies with diameter d tends to be proportional to d to the power 5 thirds, 

129
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:49,633
at least within a specific range of length scales known fancifully as the inertial 

130
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,180
subrange.

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,220
For air, this ranges from about 0.1 cm up to 1 km.

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,500
This fact has since been verified by experiment many times over.

133
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,340
It would appear that 5 thirds is a sort of fundamental constant of turbulence.

134
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,544
It's an oddly specific fact, I know, but what I love about 

135
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:13,005
the existence of a constant like this is that it suggests there's some predictability, 

136
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,800
however slight, to this whole mass.

137
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:22,192
There is something ironic about talking about this energy cascade while viewing 

138
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:26,524
two-dimensional slices of a fluid, because it is a distinctly three-dimensional 

139
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,120
phenomenon.

140
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,425
While fluid flow in two dimensions can have a sort of turbulence, 

141
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:34,642
this energy transfer actually tends to go the other way, 

142
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,900
from the small scales up to larger ones.

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,080
So keep in mind, while you're looking at this 2d slice of turbulence, 

144
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,300
it's actually very different in character from turbulence in 2d.

145
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,755
One of the mechanisms behind this energy cascade, 

146
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:54,680
which could only ever happen in three dimensions, is a process known as vortex stretching.

147
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:59,239
A rotating part of the fluid will tend to stretch out perpendicular 

148
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:03,500
to the plane of rotation, resulting in smaller eddies spinning faster.

149
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,070
This transition from energy held in a large vortex to instead being held in smaller 

150
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,500
vortices would be impossible if there weren't another dimension to stretch in.

151
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,857
Or if this vortex were bent around to meet itself in a ring shape, 

152
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:22,800
in a way it's like a vortex which is blocking itself from stretching out this way.

153
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,407
And as mentioned earlier, this is indeed a surprisingly stable configuration for a fluid, 

154
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:29,500
order amidst chaos.

155
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,831
Interestingly though, when we made these vortex rings in practice and followed them 

156
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:38,501
over a long period of time, they do have a tendency to slowly stretch out, 

157
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:42,760
albeit at a much longer time scale than the vortex stretching I was just talking about.

158
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Which brings us back to Diana and Dan.

159
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,500
Huge thanks to the both of them for getting so much footage and making all of this happen.

160
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,549
Make sure to hop over to Physics Girl now to see some of the vortex ring demos, 

161
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:56,732
and as I said, you'll also get to learn about something that happens 

162
