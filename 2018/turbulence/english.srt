1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
The air around you is in constant and chaotic motion, replete with nearly impossible to

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,000
predict swirls, ranging from large to minuscule.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
What you're looking at right now is a cross-section of the flow in a typical room, made visible

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,560
using a home demo involving a laser, a glass rod, and a fog machine.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,560
Predicting the specifics of turbulent motion like this has long evaded mathematicians and

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,360
physicists, but we are steadily getting closer to understanding some consistent patterns

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
in this chaos, and in a minute I'll share with you one specific quantitative result

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,840
describing a certain self-similarity to this motion.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,740
To back up a bit, I was recently in San Diego and spent a day with Diana Cowarn, aka Physics

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,900
Girl, and her frequent collaborator, Dan Walsh, playing around with vortex rings.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,080
This is a really surprising fluid flow phenomenon, where a doughnut-shaped region of fluid stays

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,440
surprisingly stable as it moves through space.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,240
If you take some open container with a lip and fill it with smoke or fog, you can use

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,840
this to actually see the otherwise invisible ring.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
Diana just published a video over on her channel showing much more of that particular demo,

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
including a genuinely fascinating observation about what happens when you change the shape

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,680
of the opening.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,360
The story for you and me starts when her friend Dan had the clever idea to visualize a slice

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,960
of what's going on with these vortex rings using a planar laser.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,960
So you know how if you shine a laser through the fog, photons will occasionally bounce

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,840
off of the particles in the fog along that beam towards your eye, thereby revealing the

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,600
beam of the laser?

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,060
Well Dan's thought was to refract that light through a glass rod so that it was relatively

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,200
evenly spread across an entire plane, then the same phenomenon would reveal the laser

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,680
light along a thin plane through that fog.

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,040
The result was awesome!

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,220
The cross-section of such a smoke ring looks like two hurricanes rotating next to each

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,040
other, and this makes abundantly clear how the surface of these rings rotates as they

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:16,800
travel, and also how chaotic they leave the air behind them.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,720
And as an added bonus, the setup doubles as a great Death Eater themed Halloween decoration.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,780
If you do want to try this at home, be super careful with the laser, make sure not to point

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,240
it near anyone's eyes.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,080
This concern is especially relevant when the laser is spread along a full plane, basically

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,800
treat it like a gun.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,680
Also credit where credit is due, I'd like to point out that after we did this we found

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,400
that the channel Nighthawk and Light has a video doing a similar demo, link in the description.

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,280
Even though our original plan was to illuminate vortex rings, I actually think the most notable

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,880
part of this visual is how it sheds light on what ordinary airflow in a room looks like,

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,200
in all of its intricacy and detail.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,180
We call this chaotic flow turbulence, and just as vortex rings give an example of unexpected

41
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,400
order in the otherwise messy world of fluid dynamics, I'd like to share with you a more

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,320
subtle instance of order amidst chaos in the math of turbulence.

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,320
First off, what exactly is turbulence?

44
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,560
The term is familiar to many of us as that annoying thing that makes plane rides bumpy,

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
but nailing down a specific definition is a little tricky.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,080
It's easiest to describe qualitatively.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,540
Turbulence involves many swirling eddies, it's chaotic, and it mixes things together.

48
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,480
One approach here would be to describe turbulence based on what it's not, laminar flow.

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,200
This term stems from the same Latin word that lamination does lamina, meaning a thin layer

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,200
of a material, and it refers to smooth flow in a fluid, where the moving particles stay

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,720
largely confined to distinct layers.

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,360
Turbulence, in contrast, contains many eddies, points of some vorticity, also known as positive

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,320
curl, also known as a high swirly swirly factor, breaking down the notion of distinct layers.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,480
However, vorticity does not necessarily imply that a flow is turbulent.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,120
Patterns like whirlpools or even smoke rings have high vorticity since the fluid is rotating,

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,600
but can nevertheless be smooth and predictable.

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,560
Instead, turbulence is further characterized as being chaotic, meaning small changes to

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,880
the initial conditions result in large changes to the ensuing patterns.

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,520
It's also diffusive in the sense of mixing together different parts of the fluid, and

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,920
also diffusing the energy and momentum from isolated parts of the fluid to the rest.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,960
Notice how in this clip, over time, the image shifts from having a crisp delineation between

62
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,160
fog and air to instead being a murky mixture of both of them.

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,120
As to something more mathematically precise, there's not really a single widely agreed

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,640
upon clear-cut criterion the way there is for most other terms in math.

65
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,360
The intricacy of the patterns you're seeing is mirrored by a difficulty to parse the physics

66
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,840
describing all of this, and that can make the notion of a rigorous definition somewhat

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
slippery.

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,920
You see, the fundamental equations describing fluid dynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations,

69
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,520
are famously challenging to understand.

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,480
We won't go through the full details here, but if you're curious, the main equation

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,860
is essentially a form of Newton's second law, that the acceleration of a body times

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,040
its mass equals the sum of the forces acting on it.

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,080
It's just that writing mass times acceleration looks a bit more complicated in this context,

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,040
and the force is broken down into the different types of forces acting on a fluid, which again

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,600
can look a bit intimidating in the context of continuum dynamics.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,900
Not only are these hard to solve in the sense of feeding in some initial state of a fluid

77
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,680
and figuring out how the equations predict that fluid will evolve, there are several

78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,920
unsolved problems around a much more modest task of understanding whether or not quote

79
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,580
unquote reasonable solutions will always exist.

80
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,700
Reusable here means things like not blowing up to a point of having infinite kinetic energy,

81
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,780
and that smooth initial states yield smooth solutions, where the word smooth carries with

82
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,860
it a very precise meaning in this context.

83
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,900
The questions formalizing the idea of these equations predicting reasonable behavior actually

84
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,660
have a $1 million prize associated with them, and all of that is just for the case of incompressible

85
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,120
fluid flow, where something compressible like air makes things trickier still, and the heart

86
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,040
of the difficulty, both for the specific solutions and the general theoretical results surrounding

87
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,800
them, is that tricky-to-pin-down phenomenon of turbulence.

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,900
But we're not completely in the dark.

89
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,040
The hard work of a lot of smart people throughout history has led us to understanding some of

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,800
the patterns underlying this chaos, and I'd like to share with you one found by the 19th

91
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,260
century mathematician Andrei Komagorov.

92
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,840
It has to do with how kinetic energy in turbulent motion is distributed at different length

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
scales.

94
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
In simpler-to-think-about physics, we often think about kinetic energy at two different

95
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,160
length scales, a macroscale, say the energy carried by your moving car, or a molecular

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,760
scale, which we call heat.

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,800
As you apply your brakes, energy is transferred more or less directly from that macroscale

98
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,120
motion to the molecular scale motion, as your brakes and the surrounding air heats up, meaning

99
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,560
all of their molecules start jiggling even faster.

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,640
Turbulence, on the other hand, is characterized by kinetic energy at a whole spectrum of length

101
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,000
scales, from the movement of large eddies to smaller ones and smaller ones and smaller

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
ones still.

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Moreover, this energy tends to cascade down the spectrum, where what I mean by that is

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
that the energy of large eddies gets converted into that of smaller eddies, which in turn

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,080
bring about smaller eddies still.

106
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,180
This goes on until it's small enough that the energy dissipates directly to heat in

107
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,300
the fluid, which is to say molecular scale jiggling, due to the fluid's viscosity,

108
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,140
which is to say how much the particles tug at each other.

109
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,580
Or, as this was all phrased in a poem by Lewis F. Richardson,

110
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,660
Big whorls have little whorls which feed on their velocity, and little whorls have lesser

111
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
whorls and so on to viscosity.

112
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,820
Now you might wonder whether more of the kinetic energy of this fluid is carried by all of

113
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,700
the larger eddies, say all those with diameter 1 meter, or by all of the smaller ones, say

114
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,260
all those with diameter 1 cm, counted together.

115
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,680
Or more generally, if you were to look at all of the swirls with a diameter D, about

116
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,620
how much of the fluid's total energy do they collectively carry?

117
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,140
Is that even an answerable question?

118
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,760
Komagorov hypothesized that the amount of energy in a turbulent flow carried by eddies

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,940
with diameter D tends to be proportional to D to the power 5 thirds, at least within a

120
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,900
specific range of length scales known fancifully as the inertial subrange.

121
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,340
For air, this ranges from about 0.1 cm up to 1 km.

122
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,960
This fact has since been verified by experiment many times over.

123
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,560
It would appear that 5 thirds is a sort of fundamental constant of turbulence.

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,620
It's an oddly specific fact, I know, but what I love about the existence of a constant

125
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,460
like this is that it suggests there's some predictability, however slight, to this whole

126
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,160
mass.

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,580
There is something ironic about talking about this energy cascade while viewing two-dimensional

128
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,960
slices of a fluid, because it is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon.

129
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,680
While fluid flow in two dimensions can have a sort of turbulence, this energy transfer

130
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,580
actually tends to go the other way, from the small scales up to larger ones.

131
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,400
So keep in mind, while you're looking at this 2D slice of turbulence, it's actually

132
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,580
very different in character from turbulence in 2D.

133
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,580
One of the mechanisms behind this energy cascade, which could only ever happen in three dimensions,

134
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,020
is a process known as vortex stretching.

135
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,900
A rotating part of the fluid will tend to stretch out perpendicular to the plane of

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,400
rotation resulting in smaller eddies spinning faster.

137
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,000
This transition from energy held in a large vortex to instead being held in smaller vortices

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,880
would be impossible if there weren't another dimension to stretch in.

139
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,760
Or if this vortex were bent around to meet itself in a ring shape, in a way it's like

140
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,960
a vortex which is blocking itself from stretching out this way, and as mentioned earlier, this

141
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,760
is indeed a surprisingly stable configuration for a fluid, order amidst chaos.

142
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,360
Interestingly though, when we made these vortex rings in practice and followed them over a

143
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,840
long period of time, they do have a tendency to slowly stretch out, albeit at a much longer

144
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,560
time scale than the vortex stretching I was just talking about.

145
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,240
Which brings us back to Diana and Dan.

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,100
Huge thanks to the both of them for getting so much footage and making all of this happen.

147
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,320
Make sure to hop over to Physics Girl now to see some of the vortex ring demos, and

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
as I said you'll also get to learn about something that happens when you change the

149
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
shape of the hole in this vortex cannon.

150
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
The result and its specifics certainly surprised me, and you'll get to hear it through Diana's

151
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,960
typical, and infectious, superhuman level of enthusiasm.
