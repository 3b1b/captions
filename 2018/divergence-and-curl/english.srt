1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Today, you and I are going to get into divergence and curl.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,140
To make sure we're all on the same page, let's begin by talking about vector fields.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,140
Essentially a vector field is what you get if you associate each point in space with

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,280
a vector, some magnitude and direction.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,820
Maybe those vectors represent the velocities of particles of fluid at each point in space,

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,240
or maybe they represent the force of gravity at many different points in space, or maybe

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
a magnetic field strength.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,000
Quick note on drawing these, often if you were to draw the vectors to scale, the longer

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,660
ones end up just cluttering up the whole thing, so it's common to basically lie a little

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,360
and artificially shorten ones that are too long, maybe using color to give some vague

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
sense of length.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,240
In principle, vector fields in physics might change over time.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,420
In almost all real-world fluid flow, the velocities of particles in a given region of space will

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,140
change over time in response to the surrounding context.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,420
Wind is not a constant, it comes in gusts, and electric field changes as the charged

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,580
particles characterizing it move around.

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,320
But here we'll just be looking at static vector fields, which maybe you think of as

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,660
describing a steady-state system.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,760
Also, while such vectors could in principle be three-dimensional, or even higher, we're

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,180
just going to be looking at two dimensions.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,060
An important idea which regularly goes unsaid is that you can often understand a vector

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,020
field which represents one physical phenomenon better by imagining what if it represented

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,420
a different physical phenomenon.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,400
What if these vectors describing gravitational force instead defined a fluid flow?

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,180
What would that flow look like?

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,240
And what can the properties of that flow tell us about the original gravitational force?

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,020
And what if the vectors defining a fluid flow were thought of as describing the downhill

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,140
direction of a certain hill?

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,820
Does such a hill even exist?

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,680
And if so, what does it tell us about the original flow?

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,260
These sorts of questions can be surprisingly helpful.

32
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,660
For example, the ideas of divergence and curl are particularly viscerally understood when

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,820
the vector field is thought of as representing fluid flow, even if the field you're looking

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,740
at is really meant to describe something else, like an electric field.

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,260
Here, take a look at this vector field, and think of each vector as describing the velocity

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,980
of a fluid at that point.

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,180
Notice that when you do this, that fluid behaves in a very strange, non-physical way.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,540
Around some points, like these ones, the fluid seems to just spring into existence from nothingness,

39
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,980
as if there's some kind of source there.

40
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,340
Some other points act more like sinks, where the fluid seems to disappear into nothingness.

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,900
The divergence of a vector field at a particular point of the plane tells you how much this

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,300
imagined fluid tends to flow out of or into small regions near it.

43
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,660
For example, the divergence of our vector field evaluated at all of those points that

44
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,380
act like sources will give a positive number.

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,440
And it doesn't just have to be that all of the fluid is flowing away from that point.

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,760
The divergence would also be positive if it was just that the fluid coming into it from

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,720
one direction was slower than the flow coming out of it in another direction, since that

48
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,080
would still insinuate a certain spontaneous generation.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,240
Now on the flip side, if in a small region around a point there seems to be more fluid

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,240
flowing into it than out of it, the divergence at that point would be a negative number.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,400
Remember, this vector field is really a function that takes in 2-dimensional inputs and spits

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,400
out 2-dimensional outputs.

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,240
The divergence of that vector field gives you a new function, one that takes in a single

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,720
2d point as its input, but its output depends on the behavior of the field in a small neighborhood

55
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,280
around that point.

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,880
In this way it's analogous to a derivative, and that output is just a single number, measuring

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,420
how much that point acts as a source or a sink.

58
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,440
And purposefully delaying discussion of computations here, the understanding for what it represents

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,480
is more important.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,480
For this, this means that for an actual physical fluid, like water rather than some imagined

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,760
one used to illustrate an arbitrary vector field, if that fluid is incompressible, the

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,840
velocity vector field must have a divergence of 0 everywhere.

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
That's an important constraint on what kinds of vector fields could solve real-world fluid

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,840
flow problems.

65
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,880
For the curl at a given point, you also think about the fluid flow around it, but this time

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,840
you ask how much that fluid tends to rotate around the point.

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,680
As in, if you were to drop a twig in the fluid at that point, somehow fixing its center in

68
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,200
place, would it tend to spin around?

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Regions where that rotation is clockwise are said to have positive curl, and regions where

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,440
it's counterclockwise have negative curl.

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,640
And it doesn't have to be that all of the vectors around the input are pointing counterclockwise,

72
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,860
or all of them are pointing clockwise.

73
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,460
A point inside a region like this one, for example, would also have non-zero curl, since

74
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,540
the flow is slow at the bottom, but quick up top, resulting in a net clockwise influence.

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,740
And really, true proper curl is a three-dimensional idea, one where you associate each point in

76
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,580
3D space with a new vector, characterizing the rotation around that point, according

77
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,540
to a certain right-hand rule.

78
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,140
I have plenty of content from my time at Khan Academy describing this in more detail,

79
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,860
but for our main purpose, I'll just be referring to the two-dimensional variant of curl, which

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,920
associates each point in 2D space with a single number, rather than a new vector.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,420
As I said, even though these intuitions are given in the context of fluid flow, both of

82
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,100
these ideas are significant for other sorts of vector fields.

83
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,200
One very important example is how electricity and magnetism are described by four special

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,440
equations.

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,820
These are known as Maxwell's equations, and they're written in the language of divergence

86
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,960
and curl.

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,640
This top one, for example, is Gauss's law, stating that the divergence of an electric

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,680
field at a given point is proportional to the charge density at that point.

89
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,100
Unpacking the intuition for this, you might imagine positively charged regions as acting

90
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,080
like sources of some imagined fluid, and negatively charged regions as being the sinks of that

91
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,280
fluid.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,080
And throughout parts of space where there is no charge, the fluid would be flowing incompressibly,

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
just like water.

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Of course, there's not some literal electric fluid, but it's a very useful and pretty

95
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,640
way to read an equation like this.

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Similarly, another important equation is that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,760
everywhere.

98
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,720
You can understand that by saying that if the field represents a fluid flow, that fluid

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,800
would be incompressible, with no sources and no sinks.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,880
This also has the interpretation that magnetic monopoles, something that acts just like a

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,640
north or south end of a magnet in isolation, don't exist, there's nothing analogous

102
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,040
to positive and negative charges in an electric field.

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,620
Likewise, the last two equations tell us that the way one of these fields changes depends

104
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,360
on the curl of the other field.

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,320
This is a purely three-dimensional idea, and a little outside of our main focus here, but

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,520
the point is that divergence and curl arise in contexts that are unrelated to flow.

107
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,040
And the back and forth from these last two equations is what gives rise to light waves.

108
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,320
And quite often, these ideas are useful in contexts which don't even seem spatial in

109
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,040
nature at first.

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,400
To take a classic example that students of differential equations often study, let's

111
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,880
say you wanted to track the population sizes of two different species, where one is a predator

112
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,260
of another.

113
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,600
The state of this system at a given time, meaning the two population sizes, could be

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,680
thought of as a point in two-dimensional space, what you would call the phase space of this

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,080
system.

116
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,300
For a given pair of population sizes, these populations may be inclined to change based

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,640
on things like how reproductive are the two species, or just how much does one of them

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
enjoy eating the other one.

119
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,360
These rates of change would typically be written analytically as a set of differential equations.

120
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,160
It's okay if you don't understand these particular equations, I'm just throwing

121
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,160
them up for those of you who are curious, and because replacing variables with pictures

122
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,320
makes me laugh a little bit.

123
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,640
But the relevance here is that a nice way to visualize what such a set of equations

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,560
is really saying is to associate each point on the plane, each pair of population sizes,

125
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,680
with a vector indicating the rates of change for both variables.

126
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,960
For example, when there are lots of foxes, but relatively few rabbits, the number of

127
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,960
foxes might tend to go down because of the constrained food supply, and the number of

128
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,240
rabbits might also tend to go down because they're getting eaten by all of the foxes,

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,560
potentially at a rate that's faster than they can reproduce.

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,760
So a given vector here is telling you how, and how quickly, a given pair of population

131
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
sizes tends to change.

132
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,480
Notice, this is a case where the vector field is not about physical space, but instead it's

133
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,480
a representation of a certain dynamic system that has two variables, and how that system

134
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,560
evolves over time.

135
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,080
This can maybe also give a sense for why mathematicians care about studying the geometry of higher

136
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
dimensions.

137
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,160
What if our system was tracking more than just two or three numbers?

138
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,200
Now the flow associated with this field is called the phase flow for our differential

139
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,320
function, and it's a way to conceptualize, at a glance, how many possible starting states

140
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
would evolve over time.

141
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,920
Operations like divergence and curl can help to inform you about the system.

142
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,000
Do the population sizes tend to converge towards a particular pair of numbers, or are there

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
some values they diverge away from?

144
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,920
Are there cyclic patterns, and are those cycles stable or unstable?

145
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
To be perfectly honest with you, for something like this you'd often want to bring in related

146
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,760
tools beyond just divergence and curl, but the frame of mind that practice with these

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,400
two ideas brings you carries over well to studying setups like this with similar pieces

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,560
of mathematical machinery.

149
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,840
If you really want to get a handle on these ideas, you'd want to learn how to compute

150
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,720
them and practice those computations, and I'll leave links to where you can learn

151
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
about this and practice if you want.

152
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,140
Again, I did some videos and articles and worked examples for Khan Academy on this topic

153
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,360
during my time there, so too much detail here will start to feel redundant for me.

154
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,900
But there is one thing worth bringing up, regarding the notation associated with these

155
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
computations.

156
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,180
Commonly, the divergence is written as a dot product between this upside-down triangle

157
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,280
thing and your vector field function, and the curl is written as a similar cross product.

158
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,860
Sometimes students are told that this is just a notational trick.

159
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,420
Each computation involves a certain sum of certain derivatives, and treating this upside-down

160
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,540
triangle as if it was a vector of derivative operators can be a helpful way to keep everything

161
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,700
straight.

162
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
But it is actually more than just a mnemonic device.

163
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,380
There is a real connection between divergence and the dot product, and between curl and

164
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,020
the cross product.

165
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,340
Even though we won't be doing practice computations here, I would like to give you at least some

166
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:31,900
vague sense for how these four ideas are connected.

167
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,620
Imagine taking some small step from one point of your vector field to another.

168
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,580
The vector at this new point will likely be a little different from the one at the first

169
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,160
point, there will be some change to the function after that step, which you might see by subtracting

170
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,020
off your original vector from that new one.

171
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,540
And this kind of difference to your function over small steps is what differential calculus

172
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,700
is all about.

173
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:03,060
The dot product gives you a measure of how aligned two vectors are, right?

174
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,080
The dot product of your step vector with that difference vector it causes tends to be positive

175
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,140
in regions where the divergence is positive, and vice versa.

176
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,220
In fact, in some sense, the divergence is a sort of average value for this dot product

177
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,800
of a step with a change to the output it causes over all possible step directions, assuming

178
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,840
that things are rescaled appropriately.

179
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,480
I mean, think about it, if a step in some direction causes a change to that vector in

180
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,800
that same direction, this corresponds to a tendency for outward flow, for positive divergence.

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,580
And on the flip side, if those dot products tend to be negative, meaning the difference

182
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,920
vector is pointing in the opposite direction from the step vector, that corresponds with

183
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,280
a tendency for inward flow, negative divergence.

184
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,320
Similarly, remember that the cross product is a sort of measure for how perpendicular

185
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
two vectors are.

186
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,360
So the cross product of your step vector with the difference vector it causes tends to be

187
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,200
positive in regions where the curl is positive, and vice versa.

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,120
You might think of the curl as a sort of average of this step vector difference vector cross

189
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,280
product.

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,320
If a step in some direction corresponds to a change perpendicular to that step, that

191
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
corresponds to a tendency for flow rotation.

192
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,720
So typically this is the part where there might be some kind of sponsor message.

193
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,520
But one thing I want to do with the channel moving ahead is to stop doing sponsored content,

194
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,200
and instead make things just about the direct relationship with the audience.

195
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,320
I mean that not only in the sense of the funding model, with direct support through Patreon,

196
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,080
but also in the sense that I think these videos can better accomplish their goal if

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,940
each one of them feels like it's just about you and me sharing in a love of math, with

198
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,160
no other motive, especially in the cases where the viewers are students.

199
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,240
There are some other reasons, and I wrote up some of my full thoughts on this over on

200
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,720
Patreon, which you certainly don't have to be a supporter to read, that's just where

201
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,760
it lives.

202
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,800
I think advertising on the internet occupies a super wide spectrum, from truly degenerate

203
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,720
clickbait up to genuinely well-aligned win-win-win partnerships.

204
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,640
I've always taken care only to do promotions for companies that I would genuinely recommend.

205
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,620
To take one example, you may have noticed that I did a number of promos for Brilliant,

206
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,120
and it's really hard to imagine better alignment than that.

207
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,760
I try to inspire people to be interested in math, but I'm also a firm believer that

208
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,400
videos aren't enough, that you need to actively solve problems, and here's a platform that

209
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,840
provides practice.

210
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,360
And likewise for any others I've promoted, too, I always make sure to feel good alignment.

211
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,020
But even still, even if you seek out the best possible partnerships, whenever advertising

212
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,680
is in the equation, the incentives will always be to try reaching as many people as possible.

213
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,240
But when the model is more exclusively about a direct relationship with the audience, the

214
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,520
incentives are pointed towards maximizing how valuable people find the experiences they're

215
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
given.

216
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,560
I think those two goals are correlated, but not always perfectly.

217
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,920
I like to think I'll always try to maximize the value of the experience no matter what,

218
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,480
but for that matter I also like to think I can consistently wake up early and resist

219
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,040
eating too much sugar.

220
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,480
What matters more than wanting something is to actually align incentives.

221
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,400
Anyway, if you want to hear more of my thoughts, I'll link to the Patreon post.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,960
And thank you again to existing supporters for making this possible, and I'll see you

223
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,760
all next video.
