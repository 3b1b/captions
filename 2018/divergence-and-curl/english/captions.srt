1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Today, you and I are going to get into divergence and curl.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,140
To make sure we're all on the same page, let's begin by talking about vector fields.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,011
Essentially a vector field is what you get if you associate 

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,480
each point in space with a vector, some magnitude and direction.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,871
Maybe those vectors represent the velocities of particles of fluid 

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,797
at each point in space, or maybe they represent the force of gravity 

7
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:29,780
at many different points in space, or maybe a magnetic field strength.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,670
Quick note on drawing these, often if you were to draw the vectors to scale, 

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,728
the longer ones end up just cluttering up the whole thing, 

10
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:42,393
so it's common to basically lie a little and artificially shorten ones that are too long, 

11
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:45,140
maybe using color to give some vague sense of length.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,780
In principle, vector fields in physics might change over time.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,223
In almost all real-world fluid flow, the velocities of particles in a given 

14
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:58,360
region of space will change over time in response to the surrounding context.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,740
Wind is not a constant, it comes in gusts.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,520
An electric field changes as the charged particles characterizing it move around.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,182
But here we'll just be looking at static vector fields, 

18
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:13,060
which maybe you think of as describing a steady-state system.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,053
Also, while such vectors could in principle be three-dimensional, 

20
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:20,100
or even higher, we're just going to be looking at two dimensions.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,708
An important idea which regularly goes unsaid is that you can often 

22
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,441
understand a vector field which represents one physical phenomenon 

23
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:32,620
better by imagining what if it represented a different physical phenomenon.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,800
What if these vectors describing gravitational force instead defined a fluid flow?

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,660
What would that flow look like?

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,420
And what can the properties of that flow tell us about the original gravitational force?

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,682
And what if the vectors defining a fluid flow were thought 

28
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:50,280
of as describing the downhill direction of a certain hill?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
Does such a hill even exist?

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,780
And if so, what does it tell us about the original flow?

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,840
These sorts of questions can be surprisingly helpful.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,577
For example, the ideas of divergence and curl are particularly viscerally understood 

33
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:06,843
when the vector field is thought of as representing fluid flow, 

34
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:10,926
even if the field you're looking at is really meant to describe something else, 

35
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:12,100
like an electric field.

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,692
Here, take a look at this vector field, and think of each 

37
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:21,920
vector as describing the velocity of a fluid at that point.

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,220
Notice that when you do this, that fluid behaves in a very strange, non-physical way.

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,432
Around some points, like these ones, the fluid seems to just spring 

40
00:02:31,432 --> 00:02:35,160
into existence from nothingness, as if there's some kind of source there.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,267
Some other points act more like sinks, where the 

42
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,400
fluid seems to disappear into nothingness.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,352
The divergence of a vector field at a particular point of the plane tells you 

44
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:51,720
how much this imagined fluid tends to flow out of or into small regions near it.

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,901
For example, the divergence of our vector field evaluated at all 

46
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:59,600
of those points that act like sources will give a positive number.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,960
And it doesn't just have to be that all of the fluid is flowing away from that point.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,258
The divergence would also be positive if it was just that the fluid coming 

49
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:13,417
into it from one direction was slower than the flow coming out of it in another 

50
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:17,420
direction, since that would still insinuate a certain spontaneous generation.

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,942
Now on the flip side, if in a small region around a point there seems to be more fluid 

52
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:29,860
flowing into it than out of it, the divergence at that point would be a negative number.

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,780
Remember, this vector field is really a function that takes 

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,980
in 2-dimensional inputs and spits out 2-dimensional outputs.

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,844
The divergence of that vector field gives you a new function, 

56
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,863
one that takes in a single 2d point as its input, 

57
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:54,667
but its output depends on the behavior of the field in a small 

58
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,540
neighborhood around that point.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,641
In this way it's analogous to a derivative, and that output is just a single number, 

60
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,620
measuring how much that point acts as a source or a sink.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,763
I'm purposely delaying discussion of computations here, 

62
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:10,380
the understanding for what it represents is more important.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,444
Notice, this means that for an actual physical fluid, 

64
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:19,446
like water rather than some imagined one used to illustrate an arbitrary vector field, 

65
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:24,447
then if that fluid is incompressible, the velocity vector field must have a divergence 

66
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,540
of zero everywhere.

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,819
That's an important constraint on what kinds of vector 

68
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,200
fields could solve real-world fluid flow problems.

69
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,845
For the curl at a given point, you also think about the fluid flow around it, 

70
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:41,140
but this time you ask how much that fluid tends to rotate around the point.

71
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,355
As in, if you were to drop a twig in the fluid at that point, 

72
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:49,020
somehow fixing its center in place, would it tend to spin around?

73
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,006
Regions where that rotation is clockwise are said to have positive curl, 

74
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:57,260
and regions where it's counterclockwise have negative curl.

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,538
It doesn't have to be that all the vectors around the input are 

76
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:03,380
pointing counterclockwise, or all of them are pointing clockwise.

77
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,392
A point inside a region like this one, for example, would also have non-zero curl, 

78
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,098
since the flow is slow at the bottom, but quick up top, 

79
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,680
resulting in a net clockwise influence.

80
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,354
And really, true proper curl is a three-dimensional idea, 

81
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:26,621
one where you associate each point in 2d space with a new vector characterizing 

82
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,462
the rotation around that point, according to a certain right-hand rule, 

83
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:34,837
and I have plenty of content from my time at Khan Academy describing this in more 

84
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:38,891
detail if you want, but for our main purpose, I'll just be referring to the 

85
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:43,159
two-dimensional variant of curl, which associates each point in 2d space with a 

86
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,240
single number rather than a new vector.

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,916
As I said, even though these intuitions are given in the context of fluid flow, 

88
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,380
both of these ideas are significant for other sorts of vector fields.

89
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,880
One very important example is how electricity and 

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,780
magnetism are described by four special equations.

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,935
These are known as Maxwell's equations, and they're 

92
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,300
written in the language of divergence and curl.

93
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,500
This top one, for example, is Gauss's law, stating that the divergence of an 

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,520
electric field at a given point is proportional to the charge density at that point.

95
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,939
Unpacking the intuition for this, you might imagine positively charged regions 

96
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,569
as acting like sources of some imagined fluid, 

97
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,206
and negatively charged regions as being the sinks of that fluid, 

98
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,339
and throughout parts of space where there is no charge, 

99
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,640
the fluid would be flowing incompressibly, just like water.

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,331
Of course, there's not some literal electric fluid, 

101
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:43,060
but it's a very useful and pretty way to read an equation like this.

102
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,765
Similarly, another important equation is that the divergence of the 

103
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,672
magnetic field is zero everywhere, and you can understand that by 

104
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:54,632
saying that if the field represents a fluid flow, 

105
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:59,960
that fluid would be incompressible, with no sources and no sinks, it acts just like water.

106
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,701
This also has the interpretation that magnetic monopoles, 

107
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:07,632
something that acts just like a north or south end of a magnet in isolation, 

108
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:11,461
don't exist, there's nothing analogous to positive and negative charges in 

109
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:12,380
an electric field.

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,019
Likewise, the last two equations tell us that the way one of 

111
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,540
these fields changes depends on the curl of the other field.

112
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,126
And really, this is a purely three-dimensional idea, 

113
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:27,674
and a little outside of our main focus here, but the point is that 

114
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:31,170
divergence and curl arise in contexts that are unrelated to flow, 

115
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,983
and side note, the back and forth from these last two equations is what 

116
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,360
gives rise to light waves.

117
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,434
And quite often, these ideas are useful in contexts 

118
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:43,180
which don't even seem spatial in nature at first.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,934
To take a classic example that students of differential equations often study, 

120
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:52,019
let's say that you wanted to track the population sizes of two different species, 

121
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,460
where maybe one of them is a predator of another.

122
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,763
The state of this system at a given time, meaning the two population sizes, 

123
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:03,171
could be thought of as a point in two-dimensional space, 

124
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,220
what you would call the phase space of this system.

125
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,137
For a given pair of population sizes, these populations may be 

126
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:14,145
inclined to change based on things like how reproductive are the two species, 

127
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:17,280
or just how much does one of them enjoy eating the other one.

128
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,685
These rates of change would typically be written 

129
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:24,120
analytically as a set of differential equations.

130
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,557
It's okay if you don't understand these particular equations, 

131
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:30,245
I'm just throwing them up for those of you who are curious, 

132
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:33,559
and because replacing variables with pictures makes me laugh a little bit.

133
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,503
But the relevance here is that a nice way to visualize what such a set of 

134
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:42,366
equations is really saying is to associate each point on the plane, 

135
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:46,740
each pair of population sizes, with a vector, indicating the rates of change 

136
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,820
for both variables.

137
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,015
For example, when there are lots of foxes, but relatively few rabbits, 

138
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,890
the number of foxes might tend to go down because of the constrained food supply, 

139
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,528
and the number of rabbits might also tend to go down because they're getting 

140
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:03,640
eaten by all of the foxes, potentially at a rate that's faster than they can reproduce.

141
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,984
So a given vector here is telling you how, and how quickly, 

142
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:10,880
a given pair of population sizes tends to change.

143
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,903
Notice, this is a case where the vector field is not about physical space, 

144
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:20,630
but instead it's a representation of a certain dynamic system that has two variables, 

145
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,720
and how that system evolves over time.

146
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,025
This can maybe also give a sense for why mathematicians 

147
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,500
care about studying the geometry of higher dimensions.

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,320
What if our system was tracking more than just two or three numbers?

149
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,026
The flow associated with this field is called the phase flow for 

150
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:39,595
our differential equation, and it's a way to conceptualize, 

151
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:43,760
at a glance, how many possible starting states would evolve over time.

152
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,780
Operations like divergence and curl can help to inform you about the system.

153
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,361
Do the population sizes converge towards a particular pair of numbers, 

154
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:56,080
or are there some values they diverge away from?

155
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,640
Are there cyclic patterns, and are those cycles stable or unstable?

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,791
To be perfectly honest with you, for something like this you'd often want to bring 

157
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,934
in related tools beyond just divergence and curl, those would give you the full story, 

158
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:13,790
but the frame of mind that practice with these two ideas brings you carries over 

159
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,600
well to studying setups like this with similar pieces of mathematical machinery.

160
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,515
If you really want to get a handle on these ideas, 

161
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:24,714
you'd want to learn how to compute them and practice those computations, 

162
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:28,220
and I'll leave links to where you can learn about this and practice if you want.

163
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,077
Again, I did some videos and articles and worked examples for Khan Academy on this 

164
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:37,740
topic during my time there, so too much detail here will start to feel redundant for me.

165
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,652
But there is one thing worth bringing up, regarding 

166
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:43,120
the notation associated with these computations.

167
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,575
Commonly, the divergence is written as a dot product between this upside-down triangle 

168
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:53,420
thing and your vector field function, and the curl is written as a similar cross product.

169
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,875
Sometimes students are told that this is just a notational trick, 

170
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,419
each computation involves a certain sum of certain derivatives, 

171
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,347
and treating this upside-down triangle as if it was a vector of derivative operators can 

172
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,840
be a helpful way to keep everything straight.

173
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,140
But it is actually more than just a mnemonic device, 

174
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,325
there is a real connection between divergence and the dot product, 

175
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,180
and between curl and the cross product.

176
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,024
Even though we won't be doing practice computations here, 

177
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:26,060
I would like to give you at least some vague sense for how these four ideas are connected.

178
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,800
Imagine taking some small step from one point of your vector field to another.

179
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,474
The vector at this new point will likely be a little different from the one 

180
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:44,522
at the first point, there will be some change to the function after that step, 

181
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:48,520
which you might see by subtracting off your original vector from that new one.

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,619
And this kind of difference to your function over 

183
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,500
small steps is what differential calculus is all about.

184
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,820
The dot product gives you a measure of how aligned two vectors are, right?

185
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,325
The dot product of your step vector with that difference vector it causes 

186
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:12,280
tends to be positive in regions where the divergence is positive, and vice versa.

187
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,011
In fact, in some sense, the divergence is a sort of average value for 

188
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:21,083
this dot product of a step with a change to the output it causes over 

189
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:25,620
all possible step directions, assuming that things are rescaled appropriately.

190
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,877
I mean, think about it, if a step in some direction causes a change to that vector in 

191
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:36,302
that same direction, this corresponds to a tendency for outward flow, 

192
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,820
for positive divergence.

193
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,916
And on the flip side, if those dot products tend to be negative, 

194
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:46,564
meaning the difference vector is pointing in the opposite direction from the step vector, 

195
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:50,180
that corresponds with a tendency for inward flow, negative divergence.

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,306
Similarly, remember that the cross product is a sort of measure for how perpendicular 

197
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:02,393
two vectors are, so the cross product of your step vector with the difference vector 

198
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:07,480
it causes tends to be positive in regions where the curl is positive, and vice versa.

199
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,768
You might think of the curl as a sort of average 

200
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:13,600
of this step vector difference vector cross product.

201
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,946
If a step in some direction corresponds to a change perpendicular to that step, 

202
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:22,000
that corresponds to a tendency for flow rotation.

203
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,060
So, typically this is the part where there might be some kind of sponsor message.

204
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,533
But one thing I want to do with the channel moving ahead is to stop doing sponsored 

205
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:41,540
content, and instead make things just about the direct relationship with the audience.

206
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,900
I mean that not only in the sense of the funding model, 

207
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,967
with direct support through Patreon, but also in the sense that I think these videos 

208
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,987
can better accomplish their goal if each one of them feels like it's just about you 

209
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:55,667
and me sharing in a love of math, with no other motive, 

210
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,300
especially in the cases where the viewers are students.

211
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,460
There are some other reasons, and I wrote up some of my full thoughts on this over on 

212
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,140
Patreon, which you certainly don't have to be a supporter to read, 

213
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,220
that's just where it lives.

214
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,701
I think advertising on the internet occupies a super wide spectrum, 

215
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:15,660
from truly degenerate clickbait up to genuinely well-aligned win-win-win partnerships.

216
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,878
I've always taken care only to do promotions for 

217
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:21,000
companies that I would genuinely recommend.

218
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,409
To take one example, you may have noticed that I did a number of promos for Brilliant, 

219
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,980
and it's really hard to imagine better alignment than that.

220
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,240
I try to inspire people to be interested in math, 

221
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,973
but I'm also a firm believer that videos aren't enough, 

222
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,220
that you need to actively solve problems, and here's a platform that provides practice.

223
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,480
And likewise for any others I've promoted too, I always make sure to feel good alignment.

224
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,258
But even still, even if you seek out the best possible partnerships, 

225
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:49,598
whenever advertising is in the equation, the incentives will 

226
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,500
always be to try reaching as many people as possible.

227
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,073
But when the model is more exclusively about a direct relationship with the audience, 

228
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:59,799
the incentives are pointed towards maximizing how valuable 

229
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,740
people find the experiences they're given.

230
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,840
I think those two goals are correlated, but not always perfectly.

231
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,331
I like to think that I'll always try to maximize the value of the 

232
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:12,309
experience no matter what, but for that matter I also like to think 

233
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,420
that I can consistently wake up early and resist eating too much sugar.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,960
What matters more than wanting something is to actually align incentives.

235
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Anyway, if you want to hear more of my thoughts, I'll link to the Patreon post.

236
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,133
And thank you again to existing supporters for making this possible, 

237
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,420
and I'll see you all next video.
