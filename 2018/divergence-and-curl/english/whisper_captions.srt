1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Today, you and I are going to get into divergence and curl.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,140
To make sure we're all on the same page, let's begin by talking about vector fields.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,060
Essentially a vector field is what you get if you associate each point in space with

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,480
a vector, some magnitude and direction.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,760
Maybe those vectors represent the velocities of particles of fluid at each point in space,

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,280
or maybe they represent the force of gravity at many different points in space, or maybe

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,780
a magnetic field strength.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,060
Quick note on drawing these, often if you were to draw the vectors to scale, the longer

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,440
ones end up just cluttering up the whole thing, so it's common to basically lie a little

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,420
and artificially shorten ones that are too long, maybe using color to give some vague

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,140
sense of length.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,780
In principle, vector fields in physics might change over time.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,360
In almost all real-world fluid flow, the velocities of particles in a given region of space will

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,360
change over time in response to the surrounding context.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,740
Wind is not a constant, it comes in gusts.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,520
An electric field changes as the charged particles characterizing it move around.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,400
But here we'll just be looking at static vector fields, which maybe you think of as

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,060
describing a steady-state system.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,640
Also, while such vectors could in principle be three-dimensional, or even higher, we're

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,100
just going to be looking at two dimensions.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,780
An important idea which regularly goes unsaid is that you can often understand a vector

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,000
field which represents one physical phenomenon better by imagining what if it represented

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,620
a different physical phenomenon.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,800
What if these vectors describing gravitational force instead defined a fluid flow?

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,660
What would that flow look like?

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,420
And what can the properties of that flow tell us about the original gravitational force?

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
And what if the vectors defining a fluid flow were thought of as describing the downhill

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
direction of a certain hill?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
Does such a hill even exist?

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,780
And if so, what does it tell us about the original flow?

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,840
These sorts of questions can be surprisingly helpful.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,760
For example, the ideas of divergence and curl are particularly viscerally understood when

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,840
the vector field is thought of as representing fluid flow, even if the field you're looking

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,100
at is really meant to describe something else, like an electric field.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Here, take a look at this vector field, and think of each vector as describing the velocity

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
of a fluid at that point.

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,220
Notice that when you do this, that fluid behaves in a very strange, non-physical way.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,300
Around some points, like these ones, the fluid seems to just spring into existence from nothingness,

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,160
as if there's some kind of source there.

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,400
Some other points act more like sinks, where the fluid seems to disappear into nothingness.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,960
The divergence of a vector field at a particular point of the plane tells you how much this

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,720
imagined fluid tends to flow out of or into small regions near it.

43
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,660
For example, the divergence of our vector field evaluated at all of those points that

44
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,600
act like sources will give a positive number.

45
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,960
And it doesn't just have to be that all of the fluid is flowing away from that point.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,780
The divergence would also be positive if it was just that the fluid coming into it from

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,760
one direction was slower than the flow coming out of it in another direction, since that

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,420
would still insinuate a certain spontaneous generation.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,220
Now on the flip side, if in a small region around a point there seems to be more fluid

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,860
flowing into it than out of it, the divergence at that point would be a negative number.

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,400
Remember, this vector field is really a function that takes in 2-dimensional inputs and spits

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,980
out 2-dimensional outputs.

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,140
The divergence of that vector field gives you a new function, one that takes in a single

54
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,700
2d point as its input, but its output depends on the behavior of the field in a small neighborhood

55
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,540
around that point.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,760
In this way it's analogous to a derivative, and that output is just a single number, measuring

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,620
how much that point acts as a source or a sink.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,380
I'm purposely delaying discussion of computations here, the understanding for what it represents

59
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,380
is more important.

60
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,420
Notice, this means that for an actual physical fluid, like water rather than some imagined

61
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,300
one used to illustrate an arbitrary vector field, then if that fluid is incompressible,

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,540
the velocity vector field must have a divergence of zero everywhere.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,440
That's an important constraint on what kinds of vector fields could solve real-world fluid

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,200
flow problems.

65
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,620
For the curl at a given point, you also think about the fluid flow around it, but this time

66
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,140
you ask how much that fluid tends to rotate around the point.

67
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,760
As in, if you were to drop a twig in the fluid at that point, somehow fixing its center in

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,020
place, would it tend to spin around?

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,820
Regions where that rotation is clockwise are said to have positive curl, and regions where

70
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,260
it's counterclockwise have negative curl.

71
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,820
It doesn't have to be that all the vectors around the input are pointing counterclockwise,

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,380
or all of them are pointing clockwise.

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,480
A point inside a region like this one, for example, would also have non-zero curl, since

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,680
the flow is slow at the bottom, but quick up top, resulting in a net clockwise influence.

75
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,700
And really, true proper curl is a three-dimensional idea, one where you associate each point in

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,520
2d space with a new vector characterizing the rotation around that point, according

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,040
to a certain right-hand rule, and I have plenty of content from my time at Khan Academy describing

78
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,680
this in more detail if you want, but for our main purpose, I'll just be referring to

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,600
the two-dimensional variant of curl, which associates each point in 2d space with a single

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
number rather than a new vector.

81
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,500
As I said, even though these intuitions are given in the context of fluid flow, both of

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,380
these ideas are significant for other sorts of vector fields.

83
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,240
One very important example is how electricity and magnetism are described by four special

84
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,780
equations.

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,660
These are known as Maxwell's equations, and they're written in the language of divergence

86
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,300
and curl.

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,700
This top one, for example, is Gauss's law, stating that the divergence of an electric

88
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,520
field at a given point is proportional to the charge density at that point.

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,140
Unpacking the intuition for this, you might imagine positively charged regions as acting

90
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,160
like sources of some imagined fluid, and negatively charged regions as being the sinks of that

91
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,840
fluid, and throughout parts of space where there is no charge, the fluid would be flowing

92
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,640
incompressibly, just like water.

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Of course, there's not some literal electric fluid, but it's a very useful and pretty

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,060
way to read an equation like this.

95
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,180
Similarly, another important equation is that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero

96
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,980
everywhere, and you can understand that by saying that if the field represents a fluid

97
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,480
flow, that fluid would be incompressible, with no sources and no sinks, it acts just

98
00:06:59,480 --> 00:06:59,960
like water.

99
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,140
This also has the interpretation that magnetic monopoles, something that acts just like a

100
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,620
north or south end of a magnet in isolation, don't exist, there's nothing analogous

101
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,380
to positive and negative charges in an electric field.

102
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,600
Likewise, the last two equations tell us that the way one of these fields changes depends

103
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,540
on the curl of the other field.

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,500
And really, this is a purely three-dimensional idea, and a little outside of our main focus

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,300
here, but the point is that divergence and curl arise in contexts that are unrelated

106
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,160
to flow, and side note, the back and forth from these last two equations is what gives

107
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
rise to light waves.

108
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,360
And quite often, these ideas are useful in contexts which don't even seem spatial in

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,180
nature at first.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,340
To take a classic example that students of differential equations often study, let's

111
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,840
say that you wanted to track the population sizes of two different species, where maybe

112
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,460
one of them is a predator of another.

113
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,700
The state of this system at a given time, meaning the two population sizes, could be

114
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,780
thought of as a point in two-dimensional space, what you would call the phase space of this

115
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,220
system.

116
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,320
For a given pair of population sizes, these populations may be inclined to change based

117
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,720
on things like how reproductive are the two species, or just how much does one of them

118
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,280
enjoy eating the other one.

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,120
These rates of change would typically be written analytically as a set of differential equations.

120
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,180
It's okay if you don't understand these particular equations, I'm just throwing

121
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,200
them up for those of you who are curious, and because replacing variables with pictures

122
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,560
makes me laugh a little bit.

123
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,600
But the relevance here is that a nice way to visualize what such a set of equations

124
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,900
is really saying is to associate each point on the plane, each pair of population sizes,

125
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,820
with a vector, indicating the rates of change for both variables.

126
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,060
For example, when there are lots of foxes, but relatively few rabbits, the number of

127
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,060
foxes might tend to go down because of the constrained food supply, and the number of

128
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,140
rabbits might also tend to go down because they're getting eaten by all of the foxes,

129
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,640
potentially at a rate that's faster than they can reproduce.

130
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,520
So a given vector here is telling you how, and how quickly, a given pair of population

131
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,880
sizes tends to change.

132
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,520
Notice, this is a case where the vector field is not about physical space, but instead it's

133
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,440
a representation of a certain dynamic system that has two variables, and how that system

134
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
evolves over time.

135
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,020
This can maybe also give a sense for why mathematicians care about studying the geometry of higher

136
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,500
dimensions.

137
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,320
What if our system was tracking more than just two or three numbers?

138
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,280
The flow associated with this field is called the phase flow for our differential equation,

139
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,820
and it's a way to conceptualize, at a glance, how many possible starting states would evolve

140
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,760
over time.

141
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,780
Operations like divergence and curl can help to inform you about the system.

142
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,300
Do the population sizes converge towards a particular pair of numbers, or are there some

143
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,080
values they diverge away from?

144
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,640
Are there cyclic patterns, and are those cycles stable or unstable?

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,480
To be perfectly honest with you, for something like this you'd often want to bring in related

146
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,440
tools beyond just divergence and curl, those would give you the full story, but the frame

147
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,940
of mind that practice with these two ideas brings you carries over well to studying setups

148
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,600
like this with similar pieces of mathematical machinery.

149
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,880
If you really want to get a handle on these ideas, you'd want to learn how to compute

150
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,760
them and practice those computations, and I'll leave links to where you can learn

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,220
about this and practice if you want.

152
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,180
Again, I did some videos and articles and worked examples for Khan Academy on this topic

153
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,740
during my time there, so too much detail here will start to feel redundant for me.

154
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,400
But there is one thing worth bringing up, regarding the notation associated with these

155
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,120
computations.

156
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,220
Commonly, the divergence is written as a dot product between this upside-down triangle

157
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,420
thing and your vector field function, and the curl is written as a similar cross product.

158
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,020
Sometimes students are told that this is just a notational trick, each computation involves

159
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,040
a certain sum of certain derivatives, and treating this upside-down triangle as if it

160
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,840
was a vector of derivative operators can be a helpful way to keep everything straight.

161
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,400
But it is actually more than just a mnemonic device, there is a real connection between

162
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,180
divergence and the dot product, and between curl and the cross product.

163
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,440
Even though we won't be doing practice computations here, I would like to give you at least some

164
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,060
vague sense for how these four ideas are connected.

165
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,800
Imagine taking some small step from one point of your vector field to another.

166
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,600
The vector at this new point will likely be a little different from the one at the first

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,240
point, there will be some change to the function after that step, which you might see by subtracting

168
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,520
off your original vector from that new one.

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,500
And this kind of difference to your function over small steps is what differential calculus

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
is all about.

171
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,820
The dot product gives you a measure of how aligned two vectors are, right?

172
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,880
The dot product of your step vector with that difference vector it causes tends to be positive

173
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,280
in regions where the divergence is positive, and vice versa.

174
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,920
In fact, in some sense, the divergence is a sort of average value for this dot product

175
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,820
of a step with a change to the output it causes over all possible step directions, assuming

176
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,620
that things are rescaled appropriately.

177
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,580
I mean, think about it, if a step in some direction causes a change to that vector in

178
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,820
that same direction, this corresponds to a tendency for outward flow, for positive divergence.

179
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,620
And on the flip side, if those dot products tend to be negative, meaning the difference

180
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,000
vector is pointing in the opposite direction from the step vector, that corresponds with

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,180
a tendency for inward flow, negative divergence.

182
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,260
Similarly, remember that the cross product is a sort of measure for how perpendicular

183
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,860
two vectors are, so the cross product of your step vector with the difference vector it

184
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,480
causes tends to be positive in regions where the curl is positive, and vice versa.

185
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,180
You might think of the curl as a sort of average of this step vector difference vector cross

186
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,600
product.

187
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,380
If a step in some direction corresponds to a change perpendicular to that step, that

188
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,000
corresponds to a tendency for flow rotation.

189
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,060
So, typically this is the part where there might be some kind of sponsor message.

190
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,040
But one thing I want to do with the channel moving ahead is to stop doing sponsored content,

191
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,540
and instead make things just about the direct relationship with the audience.

192
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,760
I mean that not only in the sense of the funding model, with direct support through Patreon,

193
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,540
but also in the sense that I think these videos can better accomplish their goal if each one

194
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,400
of them feels like it's just about you and me sharing in a love of math, with no other

195
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,300
motive, especially in the cases where the viewers are students.

196
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,280
There are some other reasons, and I wrote up some of my full thoughts on this over on

197
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,780
Patreon, which you certainly don't have to be a supporter to read, that's just where

198
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,220
it lives.

199
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,880
I think advertising on the internet occupies a super wide spectrum, from truly degenerate

200
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,660
clickbait up to genuinely well-aligned win-win-win partnerships.

201
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,000
I've always taken care only to do promotions for companies that I would genuinely recommend.

202
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,940
To take one example, you may have noticed that I did a number of promos for Brilliant,

203
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,980
and it's really hard to imagine better alignment than that.

204
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,840
I try to inspire people to be interested in math, but I'm also a firm believer that

205
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,460
videos aren't enough, that you need to actively solve problems, and here's a platform that

206
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,220
provides practice.

207
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,480
And likewise for any others I've promoted too, I always make sure to feel good alignment.

208
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,980
But even still, even if you seek out the best possible partnerships, whenever advertising

209
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,500
is in the equation, the incentives will always be to try reaching as many people as possible.

210
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,320
But when the model is more exclusively about a direct relationship with the audience, the

211
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,460
incentives are pointed towards maximizing how valuable people find the experiences they're

212
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:01,740
given.

213
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,840
I think those two goals are correlated, but not always perfectly.

214
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,100
I like to think that I'll always try to maximize the value of the experience no matter

215
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,020
what, but for that matter I also like to think that I can consistently wake up early

216
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,420
and resist eating too much sugar.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,960
What matters more than wanting something is to actually align incentives.

218
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Anyway, if you want to hear more of my thoughts, I'll link to the Patreon post.

219
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,060
And thank you again to existing supporters for making this possible, and I'll see you

220
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,820
all next video.
