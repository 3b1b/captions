1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,540
Alright, I think you're going to like this.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,880
I want to show you a beautiful result that reveals a surprising connection between a

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,500
simple series of fractions and the geometry of circles.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,120
But unlike some other results like this that you may have seen before, this one involves

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,620
multiplying things instead of adding them up.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,000
The video you're about to watch is particularly exciting for us at 3Blue1Brown, because it

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,680
came about a little differently from most of the videos we've done.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,020
If you step back and think about it, the value of any kind of math presentation comes from

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,180
a combination of the underlying math and all of the choices that go into how to communicate

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,600
it.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,460
And for almost all of the content on this channel, the underlying math is something

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,840
that's well known in the field, either based on general theory or some particular paper,

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,460
and my hope is for the novelty to come from the communication half.

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,600
And with this video, the result we're discussing, a very famous infinite product for pi known

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,400
as the Wallace product, is indeed well known math.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,560
However, what we'll be presenting is, to our knowledge, a more original proof of this

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,020
result.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,780
For context, after watching our video on the Basel problem, Sweeter, the new 3b1b member

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,200
who some of you may remember from the video about color and winding numbers, well, he

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,960
spent some time thinking about the approach taken in that video, as well as thinking about

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,100
the connection between the Basel problem and the Wallace product, and he's tumbled

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,640
into a new proof of the relationship between the Wallace product and pi.

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,400
I mean, I'll leave open the possibility that an argument of this style is hidden somewhere

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,180
in the literature beyond what our searching pulled up, but I can at least say that it

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,120
was found independently, and that if it does exist out there, it has done a fantastic job

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,680
hiding itself from the public view.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,100
So, without further ado, let's dive into the math.

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,400
Consider the product 2 over 1 times 4 over 3 times 6 over 5 on and on and on, where what

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,140
we're doing is including all the even numbers as the numerators and odd numbers as the denominators.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,300
Of course, all the factors here are bigger than 1, so as you go through the series, multiplying

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,500
each new factor in one by one, the result keeps getting bigger and bigger.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,160
In fact, it turns out that it eventually gets bigger than any finite limit, so in that sense

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,840
it's not super interesting, it just blows up to infinity.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,460
And on the other hand, if you shift things over slightly, looking at 2 divided by 3 times

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,800
4 divided by 5 times 6 divided by 7, on and on, all of those factors are less than 1,

36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,280
so the result keeps getting smaller and smaller, and this time the series turns out to approach

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,640
0.

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,120
But, what if we mixed the two?

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,560
If you looked at 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5, on and on like this,

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,500
where now the partial products along the way keep going up and then down, and then up and

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,160
then down, then up a little bit, and then down a little bit less, until all of these

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,980
jumps and falls are of almost no change at all.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,200
So now it must be converging to some kind of positive finite value, but what is that value?

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,980
Believe it or not, we'll discover that this equals pi divided by 2.

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,560
And to understand the connection between this product, apparently unrelated to circles,

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,700
and pi, we're going to need to take a slight digression through a few geometric tools.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
It's a productive digression though, since these are some useful ideas to have in your

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,320
problem-solving tool belt for all kinds of other math.

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,980
The setup here involves a circle with many different points evenly spaced around it,

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,860
and then one additional special point.

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,700
This is similar to what we had in the video on the Basel problem, where we pictured these

52
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,260
evenly spaced points as lighthouses, and thought of that special point as an observer.

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,780
Back then, the quantity we cared about involved looking at the distance between the observer

54
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,240
and each lighthouse, then taking the inverse square of each of those distances and adding

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,880
them all up.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,900
This is why we had the whole narrative with lighthouses in the first place, since the

57
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,100
inverse square law gave a really nice physical interpretation to this quantity, it was the

58
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,780
total amount of light received by that observer.

59
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,260
But despite that nice physical interpretation, there's nothing magical about adding inverse

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,560
square distances, that just happened to be what was useful for that particular problem.

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,360
Now to tackle our new problem, of 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,220
5 and so on, we're going to do something similar but different in the details.

63
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,700
Instead of using the inverse square distances, just look at the distances themselves directly,

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,800
and instead of adding them up, we'll be multiplying them, giving a quantity I'll

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,120
be referring to as the distance product for the observer.

66
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,700
And even though this distance product no longer has a nice physical analogy, I still want

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,760
to illustrate it with lighthouses and an observer, because, well, it's pretty, and also more

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,600
fun than abstract geometric points.

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,580
For this proof of the Wallace product, we're going to need two key facts about this distance

70
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,940
product, two little lemmas.

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,800
First, if the observer is positioned halfway between two lighthouses on the circle, this

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,000
distance product, the thing that you get by multiplying together the lengths of all these

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,940
lines, works out to be exactly 2, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,080
And second, if you remove one of those lighthouses and put the observer in its place, this distance

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,180
product from all the remaining lighthouses equals the number of lighthouses you started

76
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,860
with.

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Again, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

78
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,880
And if those two facts seem crazy, I agree!

79
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,420
I mean, it's not even obvious that the distance product here should work out to be an integer

80
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,200
in either case.

81
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,880
And also, it seems super tricky to actually compute all of the distances and then multiply

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,020
them together like this.

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,440
But it turns out there is a, well, a trick to this tricky calculation that makes it quite

84
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,880
simple.

85
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,700
The main idea is that the geometric property of these points being evenly spaced around

86
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,940
a circle corresponds to a really nice algebraic property if we imagine this to be the unit

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,900
circle in the complex plane, with each of those lighthouses now sitting on some specific

88
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,800
complex number.

89
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,800
Some of you might recognize these as the roots of unity, but let me quickly walk through

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
this idea in case any of you are unfamiliar.

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Think about squaring one of these numbers.

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,300
It has a magnitude of one, so that's going to stay the same, but the angle it makes with

93
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,920
the horizontal will double, that's how squaring complex numbers works.

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,200
Similarly, cubing this number is going to triple the angle it makes with the horizontal,

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
and in general, raising it to the nth power multiplies the angle by n.

96
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,920
So, for example, on screen right now there are seven evenly spaced points around the

97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,680
unit circle, which I'll call l0, l1, l2, and so on, and they're rotated in such a

98
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,780
way that l0 is sitting at the number 1 on that right hand side.

99
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,360
So because the angle that each one of these makes with the horizontal is an integer multiple

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,100
of 1 seventh of a turn, raising any one of these numbers to the 7th power rotates you

101
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,180
around to landing on the number 1.

102
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,400
In other words, these are all solutions to the polynomial equation x to the 7th minus

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,920
1 equals 0.

104
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,740
But on the other hand, we could construct a polynomial that has these numbers as roots

105
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:42,220
a totally different way, by taking x minus l0 times x minus l1 up to x minus l6, I mean

106
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,740
you plug in any one of these numbers and that product will have to equal 0.

107
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,520
And because these two degree-7 polynomials have the same seven distinct roots and the

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,000
same leading term, it's just x to the 7th in both cases, they are in fact one and the same.

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Now take a moment to appreciate just what a marvelous fact that is.

110
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,820
This right hand side looks like it would be an absolute nightmare to expand.

111
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,240
Not only are there a lot of terms, but writing down what exactly each of those complex numbers

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,840
is is going to land us in a whole mess of sines and cosines.

113
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,880
But because of the symmetry of the setup, we know that when all of the algebraic dust

114
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,200
settles, it's going to simplify down to just being x to the 7th minus 1.

115
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,380
All of the other terms will cancel out.

116
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,320
And of course there's nothing special about 7 here.

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,040
If you have n points evenly spaced around a circle like this, they are the roots of

118
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,600
x to the n minus 1 equals 0.

119
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,780
And now you might see why this would give a nice simplifying trick for computing the

120
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,940
distance product that we defined a moment ago.

121
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,060
If you consider the observer to be any other complex number, not necessarily on the circle,

122
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,620
and then you plug in that number for x, that right hand side there is giving you some new

123
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,480
complex number whose magnitude is the product of the distances between the observer and

124
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,120
each lighthouse.

125
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,220
But look at that left hand side, it is a dramatically simpler way to understand what that product

126
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,280
is ultimately going to simplify down to.

127
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,480
Surprisingly, this means that if our observer sits on the same circle as the lighthouses,

128
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,280
the actual number of lighthouses won't be important.

129
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,220
It's only the fraction of the way between adjacent lighthouses that describes our observer

130
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,540
which will come into play.

131
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,540
If this fraction is f, then observer to the power n lands f of the way around a full circle,

132
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:42,600
so the magnitude of the complex number observer to the n minus 1 is the distance between the

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,260
number 1 and a point f of the way around a full unit circle.

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,620
For example, on screen right now we have 7 lighthouses, and the observer is sitting 1

135
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,980
third of the way between the first and the second.

136
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,180
So when you raise the complex number associated with that observer to the 7th power, they

137
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,160
end up 1 third of the way around the full circle.

138
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,760
So the magnitude of observer to the 7 minus 1 would be the length of this cord right here,

139
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,580
which for 1 third of the way around the circle happens to be about 1.73.

140
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,000
And remember, this value is, quite remarkably, the same as the full distance product that

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,720
we care about.

142
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,940
We could increase or decrease the number of lighthouses, and no matter what, so long as

143
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,980
that observer is 1 third of the way between lighthouses, we would always get the length

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,660
of this same cord as our distance product.

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,640
In general, let's define a special function for ourselves, cord of f, which will mean

146
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,660
for any fraction f, the length of a cord corresponding to that fraction of a unit circle.

147
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,820
So for example, what we just saw was cord of 1 third.

148
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,080
Actually, it's not so hard to see that cord of f amounts to the same thing as 2 times

149
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:05,980
the sine of f halves times 2 pi, which is 2 times the sine of f pi, but sometimes it's

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,080
easier to just think of it as cord of f.

151
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,700
So the result we've just shown is that for an observer, f of the way between two lighthouses,

152
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,480
the total distance product, as complicated as that might seem, works out to be exactly

153
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,800
cord of f, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

154
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,060
So in particular, think about cord of 1 half.

155
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,680
This is the distance between two points on the opposite ends of a unit circle, which

156
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,220
is 2.

157
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,780
So we see that no matter how many lighthouses there are, equally spread around the unit

158
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,020
circle, putting an observer exactly halfway along the circle between two of them results

159
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,360
in a distance product of precisely 2.

160
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,500
And that's our first key fact, so just tuck that away.

161
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,460
For the next key fact, imagine putting the observer right on one of the lighthouses.

162
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,920
Well, then of course the distance product is 0.

163
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,680
The distance 0 lighthouses ends up annihilating all other factors.

164
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,800
But suppose we just got rid of that one troublesome lighthouse, and considered only the contributions

165
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,100
from all the other ones.

166
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
What would that distance product work out to be?

167
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,320
Well, now instead of considering the polynomial observer to the n-1, which has a root at all

168
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,840
of these n roots of unity, we're looking at the polynomial observer to the n-1 divided

169
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,460
by observer-1, which has a root at all of the roots of unity except for the number 1

170
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,220
itself.

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,040
And a little algebra shows that this fraction is the same thing as 1 plus observer plus

172
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,520
observer squared, up to observer to the n-1.

173
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,460
And so if you plug in observer equals 1, since that's the number he's sitting on, what

174
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,820
do you get?

175
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,820
All of the terms here become 1, so it works out to be n, which means the total distance

176
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,780
product for this setup equals the number of original lighthouses.

177
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,720
This does depend on the total number of lighthouses, but only in a very simple way.

178
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,920
Think about this, this is incredible, the total distance product that an observer sitting

179
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,500
at one of the lighthouses receives from all other lighthouses is precisely n, where n

180
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,200
is the total number of lighthouses, including the ignored one.

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,560
That is our second key fact.

182
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,980
And by the way, proving geometric facts with complex polynomials like this is pretty standard

183
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,000
in math, and if you went up to your local mathematician and showed him or her these

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,080
two facts, or other facts like these, they'd recognize both that these facts are true,

185
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
and how to prove them using the methods we just showed.

186
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,360
And now, so can you!

187
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,300
So next, with both these facts in our back pocket, let's see how to use them to understand

188
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,260
the product we're interested in, and how it relates to pi.

189
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,080
Take this setup, with n lighthouses evenly spaced around a unit circle, and imagine two

190
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,260
separate observers, what I'll call the keeper and the sailor.

191
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,820
Put the keeper directly on one of the lighthouses, and put the sailor halfway between that point

192
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
and the next lighthouse.

193
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,460
The idea here will be to look at the distance product for the keeper divided by the distance

194
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,760
product for the sailor, and then compute this ratio in two separate ways.

195
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,320
From the first key fact, we know that the total distance product for the sailor is 2.

196
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,240
And the distance product for the keeper?

197
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,820
Well, it's 0, since he's standing right on top of 1.

198
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,300
But if we got rid of that lighthouse, then by our second key fact, the remaining distance

199
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,400
product for that keeper is n.

200
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,640
And of course, by getting rid of that lighthouse, we've also gotten rid of its contribution

201
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,900
to the sailor's distance product, so that denominator now has to be divided by the distance

202
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,000
between the two observers.

203
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,880
And simplifying this just a little bit, it means that the ratio between the keeper's

204
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,700
distance product and the sailor's is n times the distance between the two observers, all

205
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,500
divided by 2.

206
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,520
But we could also compute this ratio in a different way, by considering each lighthouse

207
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,320
individually.

208
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,300
For each lighthouse, think about its contribution to the keeper's distance product, meaning

209
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,000
its distance to the keeper, divided by its contribution to the sailor's distance product,

210
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,640
its distance to the sailor.

211
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,220
And when we multiply all of these factors up over each lighthouse, we have to get the

212
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,600
same ratio in the end, n times the distance between the observers, all divided by 2.

213
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,220
Now that might seem like a super messy calculation, but as n gets larger, this actually gets simpler

214
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,720
for any particular lighthouse.

215
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,440
For example, think about the first lighthouse after the keeper, in the sense of counter-clockwise

216
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,920
from him.

217
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,420
This is a bit closer to the sailor than it is to the keeper, specifically the angle from

218
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,220
this lighthouse to the keeper is exactly twice the angle from this lighthouse to the sailor.

219
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,040
And those angles aren't exactly proportional to the straight line distances, but as n gets

220
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,120
larger and larger, the correspondence gets better and better.

221
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,500
And for a very large n, the distance from the lighthouse to the keeper is very nearly

222
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,100
twice the distance from that lighthouse to the sailor.

223
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,980
And in the same way, looking at the second lighthouse after the keeper, it has an angle

224
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,140
to keeper divided by angle to sailor ratio of exactly 4 thirds, which is very nearly

225
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,540
the same as the distance to keeper divided by distance to sailor ratio as n gets large.

226
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,920
And that third lighthouse, L3, is going to contribute a fraction that gets closer and

227
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,960
closer to 6 fifths as n is approaching infinity.

228
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,080
Now for this proof, we're going to want to consider all the lighthouses on the bottom

229
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,320
of the circle a little bit differently, which is why I've enumerated them negative 1, negative

230
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,080
2, negative 3, and so on.

231
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,280
If you look at that first lighthouse before the keeper, it has a distance to keeper over

232
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,300
distance to sailor ratio that approaches 2 thirds as n approaches infinity.

233
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,120
And then the second lighthouse before it, L-2 here, contributes a ratio that gets closer

234
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,500
and closer to 4 fifths, and the third lighthouse, L-3, contributes a fraction closer and closer

235
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,300
to 6 sevenths, and so on.

236
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,560
Combining this over all of the lighthouses, we get the product 2 over 1 times 2 over 3

237
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,880
times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5 times 6 over 5 times 6 over 7, on and on and on.

238
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,520
This is the product that we're interested in studying, and in this context, each one

239
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,040
of those terms reflects what the contribution for a particular lighthouse is as n approaches

240
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,580
infinity.

241
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,220
And when I say contribution, I mean the contribution to this ratio of the keeper's distance product

242
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,340
to the sailor's distance product, which we know at every step has to equal n times

243
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,640
the distance between the observers divided by 2.

244
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,780
So what does that value approach as n approaches infinity?

245
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,840
The distance between the observers is half of 1 over n of a full turn around the circle,

246
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,380
and since this is a unit circle, its total circumference is 2 pi, so the distance between

247
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,920
the observers approaches pi divided by n, and therefore n times this distance divided

248
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,140
by 2 approaches pi divided by 2.

249
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,220
So there you have it!

250
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,440
Our product, 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5, on and on and on,

251
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,980
must approach pi divided by 2.

252
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,300
This is a truly marvelous result, and it's known as the Wallace product, named after

253
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,320
17th century mathematician John Wallace, who first discovered this fact in a way more convoluted

254
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,720
way.

255
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,280
And also, a little bit of trivia, this is the same guy who discovered, or well, invented,

256
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,680
the infinity symbol.

257
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,880
And, actually, if you look back at this argument, we've pulled a little bit of sleight of

258
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,060
hand in the informality here, which the particularly mathematically sophisticated among you might

259
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,580
have caught.

260
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,760
What we have here is a whole bunch of factors which we knew multiplied together to get n

261
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,580
times the distance between the observers divided by 2, and then we looked at the limit of each

262
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,720
factor individually as n went to infinity, and concluded that the product of all of those

263
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,260
limiting terms had to equal whatever the limit of n times the distance between the

264
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,960
observers divided by 2 is.

265
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,340
But what that assumes is that the product of limits is equal to the limit of products,

266
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,460
even when there's infinitely many factors.

267
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,120
And this kind of commuting of limits in infinitary arithmetic, well, it's not always true.

268
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
It often holds, but it sometimes fails.

269
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,240
Here, let me show you a simple example of a case where this kind of commuting of limits

270
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,740
doesn't actually work out.

271
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,240
So we've got a grid here where every row has a single 7 and then a whole bunch of ones.

272
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,720
So if you were to take the infinite product of each row, you just get 7 for each one of

273
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:46,940
them.

274
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,560
So since every one of these products is 7, the limit of the products is also 7.

275
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,040
But look at what happens if you take the limits first.

276
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,400
If you look at each column, the limit of a given column is going to be 1, since at some

277
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,120
point it's nothing but 1s.

278
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,240
But then, if you're taking the product of those limits, you're just taking the product

279
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,780
of a bunch of ones, so you get a different answer, namely 1.

280
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,320
Luckily, mathematicians have spent a lot of time thinking about this phenomenon, and they've

281
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,280
developed tools for quickly seeing certain conditions under which this exchanging of

282
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
the limits actually works.

283
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,860
In this case, a particular standard result known as dominated convergence quickly assures

284
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,700
us that the argument we just showed will go through in full rigor.

285
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,340
For those of you who are interested, Sridhar has written up a supplemental blog post to

286
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,900
this video which covers those details, along with many more things.

287
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,600
And I should also say, we need to be a little careful about how to interpret a product like

288
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:44,920
this.

289
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,100
Remember, we have contributions from lighthouses counterclockwise from the keeper, as well

290
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,880
as lighthouses clockwise from the keeper, and what we did was interleave these in order

291
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
to get our product.

292
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,700
The lighthouses counterclockwise from the keeper contribute 2 over 1, 4 over 3, 6 over

293
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,560
5, on and on, and the ones clockwise from the keeper contribute 2 over 3, 4 over 5,

294
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,460
6 over 7.

295
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,480
And like I said before, if you play around with those individual series, you'll find

296
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,880
that the first one gets larger and larger and blows up to infinity, and the second one

297
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,060
gets smaller and smaller, approaching zero.

298
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,180
So it's actually pretty delicate to make sense out of this overall product in terms

299
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,680
of computing the two halves separately and then combining them.

300
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,640
And indeed, we'll find that if you intermix these two halves differently, for example

301
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,040
taking twice as many factors from one of them for each factor from the other, you could

302
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,420
get a different result for the overall product.

303
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,180
It's only when you specifically combine them in this one-for-one manner that you get a

304
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,960
product that converges to pi halves.

305
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,560
This is something that falls out of the way that dominated convergence justifies us in

306
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,200
commuting limits the way we did, and again, for more details, see the supplemental post.

307
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,800
Still, those are just technicalities.

308
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,840
The conceptual gist for what's going on here is exactly what we just showed.

309
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,980
And in fact, after doing all that work, it would be a shame not to take a quick moment

310
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,900
to talk about one more neat result that falls out of this argument.

311
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,680
Arguably, this is the coolest part of the whole proof.

312
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,420
You see, we can generalize this whole discussion.

313
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,260
Think back to when we discovered our first key fact, where we saw that you could not

314
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,520
only consider placing the sailor precisely halfway between lighthouses, but any fraction,

315
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,040
f, of the way between adjacent lighthouses.

316
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,940
In that more general setting, the distance product for the sailor wasn't necessarily

317
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,500
2, but it was chord of f, where f is that fraction of the way between lighthouses.

318
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,100
If we go through the same reasoning that we just did with the sailor at this location

319
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,520
instead and change nothing else, what we'll find is that the ratio of the keeper's distance

320
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,980
product to the sailor's distance product is now n times the distance between them divided

321
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,880
by chord of f, which approaches f times 2 pi divided by chord of f as n gets larger.

322
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,220
And in the same way as before, you could alternatively calculate this by considering the

323
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,460
contributions from each individual lighthouse.

324
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,180
If you take the time to work this out, the kth lighthouse after the keeper will contribute

325
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,500
a factor of k divided by k-f to this ratio.

326
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,960
And all the lighthouses before the keeper, they contribute the same thing, but you're

327
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,880
just plugging in negative values for k.

328
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,580
If you combine all those contributions over all non-zero integers k, where in the same

329
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,140
way as before you have to be careful about how you bundle the positive and negative k

330
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,200
terms together, what you'll get is that the product of k divided by k-f over all

331
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,920
non-zero integers k is going to equal f times 2 pi divided by chord of f.

332
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:02,360
Put another way, since chord of f is 2 times the sine of f pi, this product is the same

333
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:09,520
as f times 2 pi divided by 2 times sine of f pi, which is f pi over sine of f pi.

334
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,800
Now rewriting this a little bit more, what you get is a pretty interesting fact.

335
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,800
Sine of f times pi is equal to f pi times this really big product, the product of 1

336
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,160
minus f over k over all non-zero integers k.

337
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,380
So what we found is a way to express sine of x as an infinite product, which is really

338
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,880
cool if you think about it.

339
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,220
So not only does this proof give us the Wallace product, which is incredible in its own right,

340
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,740
it also generalizes to give us the product formula for the sine.

341
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,740
And what's neat about that is that it connects to how Euler originally solved the Basel problem,

342
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,840
the sum that we saw in the previous video.

343
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,880
He was looking at this very infinite product for sine.

344
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,880
I mean, connecting these formulas for pi to circles is one thing, but connecting them

345
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,820
to each other is another thing entirely.

346
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,920
