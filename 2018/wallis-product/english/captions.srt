00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:05,540
Alright, I think you're going to like this.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,407
I want to show you a beautiful result that reveals a surprising connection 

3
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:12,500
between a simple series of fractions and the geometry of circles.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,520
But unlike some other results like this that you may have seen before, 

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,620
this one involves multiplying things instead of adding them up.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,977
The video you're about to watch is particularly exciting for us at 3Blue1Brown, 

7
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:29,680
because it came about a little differently from most of the videos we've done.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,693
If you step back and think about it, the value of any kind of 

9
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:37,090
math presentation comes from a combination of the underlying 

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,600
math and all of the choices that go into how to communicate it.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,199
And for almost all of the content on this channel, 

12
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,384
the underlying math is something that's well known in the field, 

13
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:49,177
either based on general theory or some particular paper, 

14
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:52,460
and my hope is for the novelty to come from the communication half.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,660
And with this video, the result we're discussing, 

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,089
a very famous infinite product for pi known as the Wallace product, 

17
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,400
is indeed well known math.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,943
However, what we'll be presenting is, to our knowledge, 

19
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:06,020
a more original proof of this result.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,265
For context, after watching our video on the Basel problem, Sweeter, 

21
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:14,214
the new 3b1b member who some of you may remember from the video about color and 

22
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:18,360
winding numbers, well, he spent some time thinking about the approach taken in that 

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,407
video, as well as thinking about the connection between the Basel problem and the 

24
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:26,504
Wallace product, and he's tumbled into a new proof of the relationship between the 

25
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,640
Wallace product and pi.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,034
I mean, I'll leave open the possibility that an argument of this style is 

27
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:35,396
hidden somewhere in the literature beyond what our searching pulled up, 

28
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:38,011
but I can at least say that it was found independently, 

29
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:41,372
and that if it does exist out there, it has done a fantastic job hiding 

30
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:42,680
itself from the public view.

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,100
So, without further ado, let's dive into the math.

32
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,585
Consider the product 2 over 1 times 4 over 3 times 6 over 5 on and on and on, 

33
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,364
where what we're doing is including all the even numbers as the 

34
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,140
numerators and odd numbers as the denominators.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,119
Of course, all the factors here are bigger than 1, so as you go through the series, 

36
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,500
multiplying each new factor in one by one, the result keeps getting bigger and bigger.

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,110
In fact, it turns out that it eventually gets bigger than any finite limit, 

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,840
so in that sense it's not super interesting, it just blows up to infinity.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,846
And on the other hand, if you shift things over slightly, 

40
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:25,614
looking at 2 divided by 3 times 4 divided by 5 times 6 divided by 7, 

41
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:28,289
on and on, all of those factors are less than 1, 

42
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,964
so the result keeps getting smaller and smaller, 

43
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:33,640
and this time the series turns out to approach 0.

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,120
But, what if we mixed the two?

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,140
If you looked at 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5, 

46
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,525
on and on like this, where now the partial products along the way keep going 

47
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:49,341
up and then down, and then up and then down, then up a little bit, 

48
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:53,613
and then down a little bit less, until all of these jumps and falls are of 

49
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:54,980
almost no change at all.

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,794
So now it must be converging to some kind of positive finite value, 

51
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,200
but what is that value?

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,980
Believe it or not, we'll discover that this equals pi divided by 2.

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,775
And to understand the connection between this product, apparently unrelated to circles, 

54
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:14,700
and pi, we're going to need to take a slight digression through a few geometric tools.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,281
It's a productive digression though, since these are some useful ideas 

56
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,320
to have in your problem-solving tool belt for all kinds of other math.

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,715
The setup here involves a circle with many different points evenly spaced around it, 

58
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:32,860
and then one additional special point.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,210
This is similar to what we had in the video on the Basel problem, 

60
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,010
where we pictured these evenly spaced points as lighthouses, 

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,260
and thought of that special point as an observer.

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,623
Back then, the quantity we cared about involved looking at the 

63
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:48,427
distance between the observer and each lighthouse, 

64
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:52,880
then taking the inverse square of each of those distances and adding them all up.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,111
This is why we had the whole narrative with lighthouses in the first place, 

66
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,743
since the inverse square law gave a really nice physical interpretation to this quantity, 

67
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,780
it was the total amount of light received by that observer.

68
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,937
But despite that nice physical interpretation, 

69
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:11,098
there's nothing magical about adding inverse square distances, 

70
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,560
that just happened to be what was useful for that particular problem.

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,695
Now to tackle our new problem, of 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 

72
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:24,220
over 5 and so on, we're going to do something similar but different in the details.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,518
Instead of using the inverse square distances, 

74
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:32,021
just look at the distances themselves directly, and instead of adding them up, 

75
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,182
we'll be multiplying them, giving a quantity I'll be referring to as the 

76
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,120
distance product for the observer.

77
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:43,971
And even though this distance product no longer has a nice physical analogy, 

78
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:48,438
I still want to illustrate it with lighthouses and an observer, because, 

79
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:52,600
well, it's pretty, and also more fun than abstract geometric points.

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,205
For this proof of the Wallace product, we're going to need 

81
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,940
two key facts about this distance product, two little lemmas.

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,950
First, if the observer is positioned halfway between two lighthouses on the circle, 

83
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,445
this distance product, the thing that you get by multiplying together the lengths of 

84
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:15,940
all these lines, works out to be exactly 2, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

85
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,885
And second, if you remove one of those lighthouses and put the observer in its place, 

86
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:30,057
this distance product from all the remaining lighthouses equals 

87
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:32,860
the number of lighthouses you started with.

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Again, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

89
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,880
And if those two facts seem crazy, I agree!

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,846
I mean, it's not even obvious that the distance product 

91
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,200
here should work out to be an integer in either case.

92
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,716
And also, it seems super tricky to actually compute all 

93
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:58,020
of the distances and then multiply them together like this.

94
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,167
But it turns out there is a, well, a trick to 

95
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,880
this tricky calculation that makes it quite simple.

96
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,061
The main idea is that the geometric property of these points being 

97
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,811
evenly spaced around a circle corresponds to a really nice algebraic 

98
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,724
property if we imagine this to be the unit circle in the complex plane, 

99
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:19,800
with each of those lighthouses now sitting on some specific complex number.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,131
Some of you might recognize these as the roots of unity, 

101
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:26,800
but let me quickly walk through this idea in case any of you are unfamiliar.

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Think about squaring one of these numbers.

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,483
It has a magnitude of one, so that's going to stay the same, 

104
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:36,590
but the angle it makes with the horizontal will double, 

105
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,920
that's how squaring complex numbers works.

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,776
Similarly, cubing this number is going to triple the angle it makes with the horizontal, 

107
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:48,880
and in general, raising it to the nth power multiplies the angle by n.

108
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,128
So, for example, on screen right now there are seven evenly spaced points 

109
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:58,026
around the unit circle, which I'll call l0, l1, l2, and so on, 

110
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:02,790
and they're rotated in such a way that l0 is sitting at the number 1 on that 

111
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,780
right hand side.

112
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,720
So because the angle that each one of these makes with the horizontal 

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,501
is an integer multiple of 1 seventh of a turn, 

114
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:15,760
raising any one of these numbers to the 7th power rotates you around to 

115
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,180
landing on the number 1.

116
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,291
In other words, these are all solutions to the 

117
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,920
polynomial equation x to the 7th minus 1 equals 0.

118
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,599
But on the other hand, we could construct a polynomial that has these numbers as 

119
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:40,334
roots a totally different way, by taking x minus l0 times x minus l1 up to x minus l6, 

120
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:45,740
I mean you plug in any one of these numbers and that product will have to equal 0.

121
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,984
And because these two degree-7 polynomials have the same seven distinct roots and the 

122
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:55,752
same leading term, it's just x to the 7th in both cases, 

123
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:58,000
they are in fact one and the same.

124
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Now take a moment to appreciate just what a marvelous fact that is.

125
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,820
This right hand side looks like it would be an absolute nightmare to expand.

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,701
Not only are there a lot of terms, but writing down what exactly each of those 

127
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,840
complex numbers is is going to land us in a whole mess of sines and cosines.

128
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,852
But because of the symmetry of the setup, we know that when all of the algebraic 

129
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:24,200
dust settles, it's going to simplify down to just being x to the 7th minus 1.

130
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,380
All of the other terms will cancel out.

131
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,320
And of course there's nothing special about 7 here.

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,475
If you have n points evenly spaced around a circle like this, 

133
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:36,600
they are the roots of x to the n minus 1 equals 0.

134
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,891
And now you might see why this would give a nice simplifying trick 

135
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,940
for computing the distance product that we defined a moment ago.

136
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,281
If you consider the observer to be any other complex number, 

137
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:52,648
not necessarily on the circle, and then you plug in that number for x, 

138
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:57,015
that right hand side there is giving you some new complex number whose 

139
00:08:57,015 --> 00:09:02,120
magnitude is the product of the distances between the observer and each lighthouse.

140
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,690
But look at that left hand side, it is a dramatically simpler way to 

141
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,280
understand what that product is ultimately going to simplify down to.

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,174
Surprisingly, this means that if our observer sits on the same circle as the lighthouses, 

143
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:19,280
the actual number of lighthouses won't be important.

144
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,872
It's only the fraction of the way between adjacent lighthouses 

145
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,540
that describes our observer which will come into play.

146
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:34,086
If this fraction is f, then observer to the power n lands f of the way around a 

147
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:40,026
full circle, so the magnitude of the complex number observer to the n minus 1 is 

148
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:46,260
the distance between the number 1 and a point f of the way around a full unit circle.

149
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,380
For example, on screen right now we have 7 lighthouses, 

150
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,980
and the observer is sitting 1 third of the way between the first and the second.

151
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,896
So when you raise the complex number associated with that observer to the 7th power, 

152
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:04,160
they end up 1 third of the way around the full circle.

153
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,483
So the magnitude of observer to the 7 minus 1 would be the length of this cord 

154
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:14,580
right here, which for 1 third of the way around the circle happens to be about 1.73.

155
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,245
And remember, this value is, quite remarkably, 

156
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:21,720
the same as the full distance product that we care about.

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,678
We could increase or decrease the number of lighthouses, and no matter what, 

158
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:30,527
so long as that observer is 1 third of the way between lighthouses, 

159
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,660
we would always get the length of this same cord as our distance product.

160
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,168
In general, let's define a special function for ourselves, cord of f, 

161
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:46,608
which will mean for any fraction f, the length of a cord corresponding to that fraction 

162
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:47,660
of a unit circle.

163
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,820
So for example, what we just saw was cord of 1 third.

164
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,655
Actually, it's not so hard to see that cord of f amounts to the same 

165
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:03,808
thing as 2 times the sine of f halves times 2 pi, which is 2 times the sine of f pi, 

166
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:08,080
but sometimes it's easier to just think of it as cord of f.

167
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,514
So the result we've just shown is that for an observer, 

168
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:16,349
f of the way between two lighthouses, the total distance product, 

169
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:20,417
as complicated as that might seem, works out to be exactly cord of f, 

170
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,800
no matter how many lighthouses there are.

171
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,060
So in particular, think about cord of 1 half.

172
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,220
This is the distance between two points on the opposite ends of a unit circle, which is 2.

173
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,981
So we see that no matter how many lighthouses there are, 

174
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,557
equally spread around the unit circle, putting an observer exactly 

175
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:43,360
halfway along the circle between two of them results in a distance product of precisely 2.

176
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,500
And that's our first key fact, so just tuck that away.

177
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,460
For the next key fact, imagine putting the observer right on one of the lighthouses.

178
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,920
Well, then of course the distance product is 0.

179
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,680
The distance 0 lighthouses ends up annihilating all other factors.

180
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,295
But suppose we just got rid of that one troublesome lighthouse, 

181
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:05,100
and considered only the contributions from all the other ones.

182
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
What would that distance product work out to be?

183
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,323
Well, now instead of considering the polynomial observer to the n-1, 

184
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:16,563
which has a root at all of these n roots of unity, 

185
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:21,328
we're looking at the polynomial observer to the n-1 divided by observer-1, 

186
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:26,220
which has a root at all of the roots of unity except for the number 1 itself.

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,773
And a little algebra shows that this fraction is the same thing as 

188
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:36,520
1 plus observer plus observer squared, up to observer to the n-1.

189
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,948
And so if you plug in observer equals 1, since that's the number he's sitting on, 

190
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:42,820
what do you get?

191
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,568
All of the terms here become 1, so it works out to be n, 

192
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:52,421
which means the total distance product for this setup equals the number of 

193
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,780
original lighthouses.

194
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,720
This does depend on the total number of lighthouses, but only in a very simple way.

195
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,360
Think about this, this is incredible, the total distance product that an observer 

196
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,682
sitting at one of the lighthouses receives from all other lighthouses is precisely n, 

197
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:11,200
where n is the total number of lighthouses, including the ignored one.

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,560
That is our second key fact.

199
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,468
And by the way, proving geometric facts with complex polynomials like this is 

200
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:22,670
pretty standard in math, and if you went up to your local mathematician and showed 

201
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,455
him or her these two facts, or other facts like these, 

202
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,935
they'd recognize both that these facts are true, 

203
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,720
and how to prove them using the methods we just showed.

204
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,360
And now, so can you!

205
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,406
So next, with both these facts in our back pocket, 

206
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:39,021
let's see how to use them to understand the product we're interested in, 

207
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,260
and how it relates to pi.

208
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,650
Take this setup, with n lighthouses evenly spaced around a unit circle, 

209
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,260
and imagine two separate observers, what I'll call the keeper and the sailor.

210
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,291
Put the keeper directly on one of the lighthouses, 

211
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,820
and put the sailor halfway between that point and the next lighthouse.

212
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,175
The idea here will be to look at the distance product for the keeper divided by the 

213
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:10,760
distance product for the sailor, and then compute this ratio in two separate ways.

214
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,320
From the first key fact, we know that the total distance product for the sailor is 2.

215
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,240
And the distance product for the keeper?

216
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,820
Well, it's 0, since he's standing right on top of 1.

217
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,673
But if we got rid of that lighthouse, then by our second key fact, 

218
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:29,400
the remaining distance product for that keeper is n.

219
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,472
And of course, by getting rid of that lighthouse, 

220
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,048
we've also gotten rid of its contribution to the sailor's distance product, 

221
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:41,000
so that denominator now has to be divided by the distance between the two observers.

222
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,659
And simplifying this just a little bit, it means that the ratio 

223
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,996
between the keeper's distance product and the sailor's is n 

224
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:52,500
times the distance between the two observers, all divided by 2.

225
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,723
But we could also compute this ratio in a different way, 

226
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,320
by considering each lighthouse individually.

227
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,702
For each lighthouse, think about its contribution to the keeper's distance product, 

228
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:08,420
meaning its distance to the keeper, divided by its contribution to 

229
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,640
the sailor's distance product, its distance to the sailor.

230
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,074
And when we multiply all of these factors up over each lighthouse, 

231
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:20,688
we have to get the same ratio in the end, n times the distance between the observers, 

232
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:21,600
all divided by 2.

233
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,561
Now that might seem like a super messy calculation, but as n gets larger, 

234
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:29,720
this actually gets simpler for any particular lighthouse.

235
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,661
For example, think about the first lighthouse after the keeper, 

236
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:35,920
in the sense of counter-clockwise from him.

237
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,842
This is a bit closer to the sailor than it is to the keeper, 

238
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:43,084
specifically the angle from this lighthouse to the keeper is 

239
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:46,220
exactly twice the angle from this lighthouse to the sailor.

240
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,162
And those angles aren't exactly proportional to the straight line distances, 

241
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:55,120
but as n gets larger and larger, the correspondence gets better and better.

242
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,344
And for a very large n, the distance from the lighthouse to the keeper 

243
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:03,100
is very nearly twice the distance from that lighthouse to the sailor.

244
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,231
And in the same way, looking at the second lighthouse after the keeper, 

245
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:14,043
it has an angle to keeper divided by angle to sailor ratio of exactly 4 thirds, 

246
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:19,216
which is very nearly the same as the distance to keeper divided by distance to sailor 

247
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:20,540
ratio as n gets large.

248
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,933
And that third lighthouse, L3, is going to contribute a fraction 

249
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:28,960
that gets closer and closer to 6 fifths as n is approaching infinity.

250
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,095
Now for this proof, we're going to want to consider all the lighthouses 

251
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,507
on the bottom of the circle a little bit differently, 

252
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:41,080
which is why I've enumerated them negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, and so on.

253
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,899
If you look at that first lighthouse before the keeper, 

254
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,818
it has a distance to keeper over distance to sailor ratio that approaches 2 thirds 

255
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:51,300
as n approaches infinity.

256
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,616
And then the second lighthouse before it, L-2 here, 

257
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:59,740
contributes a ratio that gets closer and closer to 4 fifths, 

258
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,623
and the third lighthouse, L-3, contributes a fraction closer and closer to 6 sevenths, 

259
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:06,300
and so on.

260
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,523
Combining this over all of the lighthouses, we get the product 2 over 1 times 2 

261
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:19,880
over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5 times 6 over 5 times 6 over 7, on and on and on.

262
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,295
This is the product that we're interested in studying, 

263
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:26,772
and in this context, each one of those terms reflects what the 

264
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:30,580
contribution for a particular lighthouse is as n approaches infinity.

265
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,647
And when I say contribution, I mean the contribution to this ratio of the 

266
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:38,701
keeper's distance product to the sailor's distance product, 

267
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:42,469
which we know at every step has to equal n times the distance between the 

268
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:43,640
observers divided by 2.

269
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,780
So what does that value approach as n approaches infinity?

270
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:55,152
The distance between the observers is half of 1 over n of a full turn around the circle, 

271
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:59,908
and since this is a unit circle, its total circumference is 2 pi, 

272
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:04,663
so the distance between the observers approaches pi divided by n, 

273
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:10,140
and therefore n times this distance divided by 2 approaches pi divided by 2.

274
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,220
So there you have it!

275
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,893
Our product, 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5, 

276
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:19,980
on and on and on, must approach pi divided by 2.

277
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,839
This is a truly marvelous result, and it's known as the Wallace product, 

278
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,597
named after 17th century mathematician John Wallace, 

279
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,720
who first discovered this fact in a way more convoluted way.

280
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,425
And also, a little bit of trivia, this is the same guy who discovered, 

281
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,680
or well, invented, the infinity symbol.

282
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,440
And, actually, if you look back at this argument, 

283
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,772
we've pulled a little bit of sleight of hand in the informality here, 

284
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:52,580
which the particularly mathematically sophisticated among you might have caught.

285
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,741
What we have here is a whole bunch of factors which we knew multiplied together 

286
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:01,167
to get n times the distance between the observers divided by 2, 

287
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:05,610
and then we looked at the limit of each factor individually as n went to infinity, 

288
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,624
and concluded that the product of all of those limiting terms had to equal 

289
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:13,960
whatever the limit of n times the distance between the observers divided by 2 is.

290
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,252
But what that assumes is that the product of limits is equal to the limit of products, 

291
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,460
even when there's infinitely many factors.

292
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,120
And this kind of commuting of limits in infinitary arithmetic, well, it's not always true.

293
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
It often holds, but it sometimes fails.

294
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,110
Here, let me show you a simple example of a case where 

295
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,740
this kind of commuting of limits doesn't actually work out.

296
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,240
So we've got a grid here where every row has a single 7 and then a whole bunch of ones.

297
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,190
So if you were to take the infinite product of each row, 

298
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,940
you just get 7 for each one of them.

299
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,560
So since every one of these products is 7, the limit of the products is also 7.

300
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,040
But look at what happens if you take the limits first.

301
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,734
If you look at each column, the limit of a given column is going to be 1, 

302
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:02,120
since at some point it's nothing but 1s.

303
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,038
But then, if you're taking the product of those limits, 

304
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,311
you're just taking the product of a bunch of ones, so you get a different answer, 

305
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:09,780
namely 1.

306
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,972
Luckily, mathematicians have spent a lot of time thinking about this phenomenon, 

307
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:20,013
and they've developed tools for quickly seeing certain conditions 

308
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,640
under which this exchanging of the limits actually works.

309
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,295
In this case, a particular standard result known as dominated convergence 

310
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:31,700
quickly assures us that the argument we just showed will go through in full rigor.

311
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,956
For those of you who are interested, Sridhar has written up a supplemental 

312
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:39,900
blog post to this video which covers those details, along with many more things.

313
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,722
And I should also say, we need to be a little 

314
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:44,920
careful about how to interpret a product like this.

315
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,709
Remember, we have contributions from lighthouses counterclockwise from the keeper, 

316
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,305
as well as lighthouses clockwise from the keeper, 

317
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:55,680
and what we did was interleave these in order to get our product.

318
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,070
The lighthouses counterclockwise from the keeper contribute 2 over 1, 4 over 3, 6 over 5, 

319
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:08,460
on and on, and the ones clockwise from the keeper contribute 2 over 3, 4 over 5, 6 over 7.

320
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,808
And like I said before, if you play around with those individual series, 

321
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:16,893
you'll find that the first one gets larger and larger and blows up to infinity, 

322
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:20,060
and the second one gets smaller and smaller, approaching zero.

323
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,751
So it's actually pretty delicate to make sense out of this overall product 

324
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,680
in terms of computing the two halves separately and then combining them.

325
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,983
And indeed, we'll find that if you intermix these two halves differently, 

326
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:37,536
for example taking twice as many factors from one of them for each factor from the other, 

327
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:40,420
you could get a different result for the overall product.

328
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,026
It's only when you specifically combine them in this one-for-one 

329
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:46,960
manner that you get a product that converges to pi halves.

330
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,885
This is something that falls out of the way that dominated convergence justifies us in 

331
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:56,200
commuting limits the way we did, and again, for more details, see the supplemental post.

332
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,800
Still, those are just technicalities.

333
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,840
The conceptual gist for what's going on here is exactly what we just showed.

334
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,138
And in fact, after doing all that work, it would be a shame not to take a 

335
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:14,900
quick moment to talk about one more neat result that falls out of this argument.

336
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,680
Arguably, this is the coolest part of the whole proof.

337
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,420
You see, we can generalize this whole discussion.

338
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,002
Think back to when we discovered our first key fact, 

339
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:28,110
where we saw that you could not only consider placing the sailor precisely 

340
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,040
halfway between lighthouses, but any fraction, f, of the way between adjacent lighthouses.

341
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,873
In that more general setting, the distance product for the sailor wasn't necessarily 2, 

342
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:43,500
but it was chord of f, where f is that fraction of the way between lighthouses.

343
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,496
If we go through the same reasoning that we just did with the sailor at this location 

344
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:54,608
instead and change nothing else, what we'll find is that the ratio of the keeper's 

345
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:59,905
distance product to the sailor's distance product is now n times the distance between 

346
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:05,448
them divided by chord of f, which approaches f times 2 pi divided by chord of f as n gets 

347
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:05,880
larger.

348
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,006
And in the same way as before, you could alternatively calculate 

349
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:15,460
this by considering the contributions from each individual lighthouse.

350
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,988
If you take the time to work this out, the kth lighthouse after the 

351
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:25,500
keeper will contribute a factor of k divided by k-f to this ratio.

352
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,624
And all the lighthouses before the keeper, they contribute the same thing, 

353
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,880
but you're just plugging in negative values for k.

354
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,982
If you combine all those contributions over all non-zero integers k, 

355
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:41,924
where in the same way as before you have to be careful about how you bundle the 

356
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:46,927
positive and negative k terms together, what you'll get is that the product of k 

357
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:52,055
divided by k-f over all non-zero integers k is going to equal f times 2 pi divided 

358
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,920
by chord of f.

359
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,522
Put another way, since chord of f is 2 times the sine of f pi, 

360
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:06,501
this product is the same as f times 2 pi divided by 2 times sine of f pi, 

361
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,520
which is f pi over sine of f pi.

362
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,800
Now rewriting this a little bit more, what you get is a pretty interesting fact.

363
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,518
Sine of f times pi is equal to f pi times this really big product, 

364
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:25,160
the product of 1 minus f over k over all non-zero integers k.

365
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,877
So what we found is a way to express sine of x as an infinite product, 

366
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:33,880
which is really cool if you think about it.

367
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,325
So not only does this proof give us the Wallace product, 

368
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:41,625
which is incredible in its own right, it also generalizes to give us the product 

369
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,740
formula for the sine.

370
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,621
And what's neat about that is that it connects to how Euler originally 

371
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:49,840
solved the Basel problem, the sum that we saw in the previous video.

372
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,880
He was looking at this very infinite product for sine.

373
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,858
I mean, connecting these formulas for pi to circles is one thing, 

374
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:59,820
but connecting them to each other is another thing entirely.

375
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,956
And once again, if you want more details on all of this, 

376
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:04,580
