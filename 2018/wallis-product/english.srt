1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Alright, I think you're going to like this.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,760
I want to show you a beautiful result that reveals a surprising connection between a

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,080
simple series of fractions and the geometry of circles.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,240
But unlike some other results like this that you may have seen before, this one involves

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,320
multiplying things instead of adding them up.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
The video you're about to watch is particularly exciting for us at 3Blue1Brown, because it

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,400
came about a little differently from most of the videos we've done.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,120
If you step back and think about it, the value of any kind of math presentation comes from

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,360
a combination of the underlying math and all of the choices that go into how to communicate

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
it.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,600
And for almost all of the content on this channel, the underlying math is something

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,480
that's well known in the field, either based on general theory or some particular paper,

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,680
and my hope is for the novelty to come from the communication half.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
With this video, the result we're discussing, a very famous infinite product for pi known

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,760
as the Wallace product, is indeed well known math.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,520
However, what we'll be presenting is, to our knowledge, a more original proof of this

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,920
result.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,920
For context, after watching our video on the Basel problem, Sweeter, the new 3B1B member

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,160
who some of you may remember from the video about color and winding numbers, well, he

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,960
spent some time thinking about the approach taken in that video, as well as thinking about

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,120
the connection between the Basel problem and the Wallace product, and he's tumbled

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,920
into a new proof of the relationship between the Wallace product and pi.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400
I mean, I'll leave open the possibility that an argument of this style is hidden somewhere

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,120
in the literature beyond what our searching pulled up, but I can at least say that it

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,160
was found independently, and that if it does exist out there, it has done a fantastic job

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,240
hiding itself from the public view.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,680
So, without further ado, let's dive into the math.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:55,400
Consider the product 2 over 1 times 4 over 3 times 6 over 5, on and on and on, where

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,080
what we're doing is including all the even numbers as the numerators, and odd numbers

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,880
as the denominators.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,440
Of course, all the factors here are bigger than 1, so as you go through the series, multiplying

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,920
each new factor in one by one, the result keeps getting bigger and bigger.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,120
In fact, it turns out that it eventually gets bigger than any finite limit.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
So in that sense, it's not super interesting, it just blows up to infinity.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,720
And on the other hand, if you shift things over slightly, looking at 2 divided by 3 times

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,280
4 divided by 5 times 6 divided by 7, on and on, all of those factors are less than 1,

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,240
so the result keeps getting smaller and smaller, and this time the series turns out to approach

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
zero.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,120
But, what if we mixed the two?

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,960
If you looked at 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5, on and on like this,

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,480
where now the partial products along the way keep going up and then down, and then up and

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,080
then down, then up a little bit, and then down a little bit less, until all of these

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,700
jumps and falls are of almost no change at all.

44
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,920
So now, it must be converging to some kind of positive finite value.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,240
But what is that value?

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,860
Believe it or not, we'll discover that this equals pi divided by 2.

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,900
And to understand the connection between this product, apparently unrelated to circles,

48
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,300
and pi, we're going to need to take a slight digression through a few geometric tools.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,580
It's a productive digression, though, since these are some useful ideas to have in your

50
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:26,360
problem-solving tool belt for all kinds of other math.

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,400
The setup here involves a circle, with many different points evenly spaced around it,

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,260
and then one additional special point.

53
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,760
This is similar to what we had in the video on the Basel problem, where we pictured these

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,280
evenly spaced points as lighthouses, and thought of that special point as an observer.

55
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,960
Back then, the quantity we cared about involved looking at the distance between the observer

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,240
and each lighthouse, then taking the inverse square of each of those distances and adding

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,340
them all up.

58
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,880
This is why we had the whole narrative with lighthouses in the first place, since the

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,040
inverse square law gave a really nice physical interpretation to this quantity, it was the

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,120
total amount of light received by that observer.

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,200
But despite that nice physical interpretation, there's nothing magical about adding inverse

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,360
square distances, that just happened to be what was useful for that particular problem.

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,120
To tackle our new problem, of 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5 and

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,080
so on, we're going to do something similar but different in the details.

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,400
Instead of using the inverse square distances, just look at the distances themselves directly,

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
and instead of adding them up, we'll be multiplying them, giving a quantity I'll

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,160
refer to as the distance product for the observer.

68
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,720
And even though this distance product no longer has a nice physical analogy, I still want

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,040
to illustrate it with lighthouses and an observer, because, well, it's pretty, and

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,920
also more fun than abstract geometric points.

71
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,560
For this proof of the Wallace product, we're going to need two key facts about this distance

72
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,400
product, two little lemmas.

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,880
First, if the observer is positioned halfway between two lighthouses on the circle, this

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,640
distance product, the thing you get by multiplying together the lengths of all these lines, works

75
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,680
out to be exactly 2, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,040
And second, if you remove one of those lighthouses and put the observer in its place, this distance

77
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,200
product from all the remaining lighthouses equals the number of lighthouses you started

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
with.

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,280
Again, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

80
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:46,040
And if those two facts seem crazy, I agree!

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,400
I mean, it's not even obvious that the distance product here should work out to be an integer

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,820
in either case.

83
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,860
And also, it seems super tricky to actually compute all the distances and then multiply

84
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,800
them together like this.

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,580
But it turns out there is a, well, a trick to this tricky calculation that makes it quite

86
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
simple.

87
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,720
The main idea is that the geometric property of these points being evenly spaced around

88
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,900
a circle corresponds to a really nice algebraic property if we imagine this to be the unit

89
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,900
circle in the complex plane, with each of those lighthouses now sitting on some specific

90
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
complex number.

91
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,780
Some of you might recognize these as the roots of unity, but let me quickly walk through

92
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,720
this idea in case any of you are unfamiliar.

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,400
Think about squaring one of these numbers.

94
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,280
It has a magnitude of 1, so that's going to stay the same, but the angle it makes with

95
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,300
the horizontal will double.

96
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,660
That's how squaring complex numbers works.

97
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,180
Similarly, cubing this number is going to triple the angle it makes with the horizontal,

98
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,620
and in general, raising it to the nth power multiplies the angle by n.

99
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,100
So for example, on screen right now there are 7 evenly spaced points around the unit

100
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,980
circle, which I'll call l0, l1, l2, and so on, and they're rotated in such a way

101
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,720
that l0 is sitting at the number 1 on the right hand side.

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,680
So because the angle that each one of these makes with the horizontal is an integer multiple

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,060
of 1 seventh of a turn, raising any one of these numbers to the 7th power rotates you

104
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,920
around to landing on the number 1.

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,740
In other words, these are all solutions to the polynomial equation x to the 7th minus

106
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,760
1 equals 0.

107
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,980
But on the other hand, we could construct a polynomial that has these numbers as roots

108
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:41,520
a totally different way, by taking x minus l0 times x minus l1 up to x minus l6.

109
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,840
I mean, you plug in any one of these numbers, and that product will have to equal 0.

110
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,680
And because these two degree-7 polynomials have the same 7 distinct roots, and the same

111
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,280
leading term, it's just x to the 7th in both cases, they are in fact one and the same.

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,300
Now take a moment to appreciate just what a marvelous fact that is.

113
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,520
This right hand side looks like it would be an absolute nightmare to expand.

114
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,240
Not only are there a lot of terms, but writing down what exactly each of those complex numbers

115
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,540
is, is going to land us in a whole mess of sines and cosines.

116
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,860
But because of the symmetry of the setup, we know that when all of the algebraic dust

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,740
settles, it's going to simplify down to just being x to the 7th minus 1.

118
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,300
All of the other terms will cancel out.

119
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,700
And of course, there's nothing special about 7 here.

120
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,140
If you have n points evenly spaced around a circle like this, they are the roots of

121
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,820
x to the n minus 1 equals 0.

122
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,760
And now, you might see why this would give a nice simplifying trick for computing the

123
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,780
distance product that we defined a moment ago.

124
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,800
If you consider the observer to be any other complex number, not necessarily on the circle,

125
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,520
and then you plug in that number for x, that right hand side there is giving you some new

126
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,460
complex number whose magnitude is the product of the distances between the observer and

127
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,140
each lighthouse.

128
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,300
But look at that left hand side, it is a dramatically simpler way to understand what that product

129
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,820
is ultimately going to simplify down to.

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,180
Surprisingly, this means that if our observer sits on the same circle as the lighthouses,

131
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,980
the actual number of lighthouses, well it won't be important.

132
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,460
It's only the fraction of the way between adjacent lighthouses that describes our observer

133
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,500
which will come into play.

134
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:36,220
If this fraction is f, then observer to the power n lands f of the way around a full circle.

135
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,540
So the magnitude of the complex number observer to the n minus 1 is the distance between the

136
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,140
number 1 and a point f of the way around a full unit circle.

137
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,660
For example, on screen right now we have 7 lighthouses, and the observer is sitting 1

138
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,860
third of the way between the first and the second.

139
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,100
So when you raise the complex number associated with that observer to the 7th power, they

140
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,920
end up 1 third of the way around the full circle.

141
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,960
So the magnitude of observer to the 7 minus 1 would be the length of this cord right here,

142
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,800
which for 1 third of the way around the circle happens to be about 1.73.

143
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,000
And remember, this value is, quite remarkably, the same as the full distance product that

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
we care about.

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,880
We could increase or decrease the number of lighthouses, and no matter what, so long as

146
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,960
that observer is 1 third of the way between lighthouses, we would always get the length

147
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,200
of this same cord as our distance product.

148
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,800
In general, let's define a special function for ourselves, cord of f, which will mean

149
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,400
for any fraction f, the length of a cord corresponding to that fraction of a unit circle.

150
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,440
So for example, what we just saw was cord of 1 third.

151
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Actually, it's not so hard to see that cord of f amounts to the same thing as 2 times

152
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,900
the sine of f halves times 2 pi, which is 2 times the sine of f pi, but sometimes it's

153
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,320
easier to just think of it as cord of f.

154
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,300
So the result we've just shown is that for an observer, f of the way between two lighthouses,

155
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,760
the total distance product, as complicated as that might seem, works out to be exactly

156
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,520
cord of f, no matter how many lighthouses there are.

157
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,600
So in particular, think about cord of 1 half, this is the distance between two points on

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,000
the opposite ends of a unit circle, which is 2.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,720
So we see that no matter how many lighthouses there are, equally spread around the unit

160
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,240
circle, putting an observer exactly halfway along the circle between two results in a

161
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,640
distance product of precisely 2.

162
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,200
And that's our first key fact, so just tuck that away.

163
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,960
For the next key fact, imagine putting the observer right on one of the lighthouses.

164
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,780
Well then of course the distance product is 0, the distance 0 lighthouse ends up annihilating

165
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,480
all other factors.

166
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,920
But suppose we just got rid of that one troublesome lighthouse, and considered only the contributions

167
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,680
from all of the other ones, what would that distance product work out to be?

168
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,200
Well, now instead of considering the polynomial observer to the n-1, which has a root at all

169
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,920
of these n roots of unity, we're looking at the polynomial observer to the n-1 divided

170
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,920
by observer-1, which has a root at all of the roots of unity except for the number 1

171
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
itself.

172
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,040
And a little algebra shows that this fraction is the same thing as 1 plus observer plus

173
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,560
observer squared, up to observer to the n-1.

174
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,440
And so if you plug in observer equals 1, since that's the number he's sitting on, what

175
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
do you get?

176
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,760
All of the terms here become 1, so it works out to be n, which means the total distance

177
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,760
product for this setup equals the number of original lighthouses.

178
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,440
This does depend on the total number of lighthouses, but only in a very simple way.

179
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,940
Think about this, this is incredible, the total distance product that an observer sitting

180
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,480
at one of the lighthouses receives from all other lighthouses is precisely n, where n

181
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,220
is the total number of lighthouses, including the ignored one.

182
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,920
That is our second key fact.

183
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,000
And by the way, proving geometric facts with complex polynomials like this is pretty standard

184
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,920
in math, and if you went up to your local mathematician and showed him or her these

185
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,520
two facts, or other facts like these, they'd recognize both that these facts are true,

186
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,320
and how to prove them using the methods we just showed.

187
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,640
And now, so can you!

188
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,340
So next, with both these facts in our back pocket, let's see how to use them to understand

189
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:45,860
the product we're interested in, and how it relates to pi.

190
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,940
Take this setup, with n lighthouses evenly spaced around a unit circle, and imagine two

191
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,900
separate observers, what I'll call the keeper and the sailor.

192
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,940
Put the keeper directly on one of the lighthouses, and put the sailor halfway between that point

193
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,560
and the next lighthouse.

194
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,460
The idea here will be to look at the distance product for the keeper divided by the distance

195
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,820
product for the sailor, and then we're going to compute this ratio in two separate ways.

196
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,100
From the first key fact, we know that the total distance product for the sailor is 2.

197
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,740
And the distance product for the keeper?

198
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,320
Well, it's 0, since he's standing right on top of one.

199
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,300
But if we got rid of that lighthouse, then by our second key fact, the remaining distance

200
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,300
product for that keeper is n.

201
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,740
And of course, by getting rid of that lighthouse, we've also gotten rid of its contribution

202
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,900
to the sailor's distance product, so that denominator now has to be divided by the distance

203
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,140
between the two observers.

204
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,740
And simplifying this just a little bit, it means that the ratio between the keeper's

205
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,620
distance product and the sailor's is n times the distance between the two observers, all

206
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,520
divided by 2.

207
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,560
But we could also compute this ratio in a different way, by considering each lighthouse

208
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,140
individually.

209
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,460
For each lighthouse, think about its contribution to the keeper's distance product, meaning

210
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,580
just its distance to the keeper, divided by its contribution to the sailor's distance

211
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,580
product, its distance to the sailor.

212
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,180
And when we multiply all of these factors up over each lighthouse, we have to get the

213
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,940
same ratio in the end, n times the distance between the observers, all divided by 2.

214
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,380
Now that might seem like a super messy calculation, but as n gets larger, this actually gets simpler

215
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,560
for any particular lighthouse.

216
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,400
For example, think about the first lighthouse after the keeper, in the sense of counter-clockwise

217
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,680
from him.

218
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,520
This is a bit closer to the sailor than it is to the keeper.

219
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,020
Specifically, the angle from this lighthouse to the keeper is exactly twice the angle from

220
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,340
this lighthouse to the sailor.

221
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:52,000
And those angles aren't exactly proportional to the straight line distances, but as n gets

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,700
larger and larger, the correspondence gets better and better.

223
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,700
And for a very large n, the distance from the lighthouse to the keeper is very nearly

224
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,400
twice the distance from that lighthouse to the sailor.

225
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,420
And in the same way, looking at the second lighthouse after the keeper, it has an angle-to-keeper

226
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,900
divided by angle-to-sailor ratio of exactly 4 thirds, which is very nearly the same as

227
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,660
the distance-to-keeper divided by distance-to-sailor ratio as n gets larger.

228
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,880
And that third lighthouse, L3, is going to contribute a fraction that gets closer and

229
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,340
closer to 6 fifths as n is approaching infinity.

230
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,100
Now for this proof, we're going to want to consider all the lighthouses on the bottom

231
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,420
of the circle a little bit differently, which is why I've enumerated them negative 1, negative

232
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,760
2, negative 3, and so on.

233
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,260
If you look at that first lighthouse before the keeper, it has a distance-to-keeper over

234
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,180
distance-to-sailor ratio that approaches 2 thirds as n approaches infinity.

235
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,120
And then the second lighthouse before it, L-2 here, contributes a ratio that gets closer

236
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,780
and closer to 4 fifths, and the third lighthouse, L-3, contributes a fraction closer and closer

237
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,740
to 6 sevenths, and so on.

238
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,860
Combining this over all of the lighthouses, we get the product 2 over 1 times 2 over 3

239
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,620
times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5 times 6 over 5 times 6 over 7, on and on and on.

240
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,580
This is the product we're interested in studying, and in this context, each one of

241
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,020
those terms reflects what the contribution for a particular lighthouse is as n approaches

242
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,060
infinity.

243
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,260
And when I say contribution, I mean the contribution to this ratio of the keeper's distance product

244
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,300
to the sailor's distance product, which we know, at every step, has to equal n times

245
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,520
the distance between the observers divided by 2.

246
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,100
So what does that value approach as n approaches infinity?

247
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,700
The distance between the observers is half of 1 over n of a full turn around the circle,

248
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,340
and since this is a unit circle, its total circumference is 2 pi, so the distance between

249
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,900
the observers approaches pi divided by n, and therefore n times this distance divided

250
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,020
by 2 approaches pi divided by 2.

251
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,600
So there you have it!

252
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,860
Our product, 2 over 1 times 2 over 3 times 4 over 3 times 4 over 5, on and on and on,

253
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,200
must approach pi divided by 2.

254
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,260
This is a truly marvelous result, and it's known as the Wallace product, named after

255
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,540
17th century mathematician John Wallace, who first discovered this fact in a way more convoluted

256
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
way.

257
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,820
And also, a little bit of trivia, this is the same guy who discovered, or rather invented,

258
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,940
the infinity symbol.

259
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,780
And actually, if you look back at this argument, we've pulled a little bit of sleight of

260
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,020
hand in the informality here, which the particularly mathematically sophisticated among you might

261
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,520
have caught.

262
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,620
What we have here is a whole bunch of factors, which we knew multiplied together to get n

263
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,780
times the distance between the observers divided by 2.

264
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,260
And then we looked at the limit of each factor individually as n went to infinity, and concluded

265
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,060
that the product of all of those limiting terms had to equal whatever the limit of n

266
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,780
times the distance between the observers divided by 2 is.

267
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,620
But what that assumes is that the product of limits is equal to the limit of products,

268
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,400
even when there's infinitely many factors.

269
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,680
And this kind of commuting of limits in infinite area arithmetic, well, it's not always true.

270
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,140
It often holds, but it sometimes fails.

271
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,200
Here, let me show you a simple example of a case where this kind of commuting of limits

272
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
doesn't actually work out.

273
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,760
So we've got a grid here where every row has a single 7 and then a whole bunch of 1s.

274
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,680
So if you were to take the infinite product of each row, you just get 7 for each one of

275
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
them.

276
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,160
So since every one of these products is 7, the limit of the products is also 7.

277
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,480
But look at what happens if you take the limits first.

278
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,320
If you look at each column, the limit of a given column is going to be 1, since at some

279
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,280
point it's nothing but 1s.

280
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,900
But then, if you're taking the product of those limits, you're just taking the

281
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,280
product of a bunch of 1s, so you get a different answer, namely 1.

282
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,560
Luckily, mathematicians have spent a lot of time thinking about this phenomenon, and they've

283
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,240
developed tools for quickly seeing certain conditions under which this exchanging of

284
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,380
the limits actually works.

285
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,840
In this case, a particular standard result known as dominated convergence quickly assures

286
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,460
us that the argument we just showed will go through in full rigor.

287
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,240
For those of you who are interested, Sridhar has written up a supplemental blog post to

288
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,800
this video which covers those details, along with many more things.

289
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,520
And I should also say we need to be a little careful about how to interpret a product like

290
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
this.

291
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,040
Remember, we have contributions from lighthouses counterclockwise from the keeper, as well

292
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,840
as lighthouses clockwise from the keeper, and what we did was interleave these in order

293
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,480
to get our product.

294
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,040
The lighthouses counterclockwise from the keeper contribute 2 over 1, 4 over 3, 6 over

295
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,960
5, on and on, and the ones clockwise from the keeper contribute 2 over 3, 4 over 5,

296
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
6 over 7.

297
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,480
And like I said before, if you play around with those individual series, you'll find

298
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,160
that the first one gets larger and larger and blows up to infinity, and the second one

299
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,860
gets smaller and smaller, approaching zero.

300
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,120
So it's actually pretty delicate to make sense out of this overall product in terms

301
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,280
of computing the two halves separately and then combining them.

302
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,620
And indeed, we'll find that if you intermix these two halves differently, for example

303
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,960
taking twice as many factors from one of them for each factor from the other, you could

304
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
get a different result for the overall product.

305
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,020
It's only when you specifically combine them in this one-for-one manner that you get a

306
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,780
product that converges to pi halves.

307
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,460
This is something that falls out of the way that dominated convergence justifies us in

308
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,780
computing limits the way we did, and again, for more details, see the supplemental post.

309
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,180
Still, those are just technicalities.

310
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:08,060
The conceptual gist for what's going on here is exactly what we just showed.

311
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,980
And in fact, after doing all that work, it would be a shame not to take a quick moment

312
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,620
to talk about one more neat result that falls out of this argument.

313
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,180
Arguably this is the coolest part of the whole proof.

314
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,200
You see, we can generalize this whole discussion.

315
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,220
Think back to when we discovered our first key fact, where we saw that you could not

316
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,920
only consider placing the sailor precisely halfway between lighthouses, but any fraction,

317
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,800
f, of the way between adjacent lighthouses.

318
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,920
In that more general setting, the distance product for the sailor wasn't necessarily

319
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,400
2, but it was chord of f, where f is that fraction of the way between lighthouses.

320
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,100
And if we go through the same reasoning that we just did with the sailor at this location

321
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,520
instead and change nothing else, what we'll find is that the ratio of the keeper's distance

322
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,020
product to the sailor's distance product is now n times the distance between them divided

323
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:09,360
by chord of f, which approaches f times 2 pi divided by chord of f as n gets larger.

324
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,820
And in the same way as before, you could alternatively calculate this by considering the contributions

325
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,380
from each individual lighthouse.

326
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,220
If you take the time to work this out, the kth lighthouse after the keeper will contribute

327
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,460
a factor of k divided by k-f to this ratio.

328
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,940
And all the lighthouses before the keeper, they contribute the same thing, but you're

329
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,820
just plugging in negative values for k.

330
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,540
If you combine all those contributions over all non-zero integers k, where in the same

331
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,040
way as before you have to be careful about how you bundle the positive and negative k

332
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,700
terms together, what you'll get is that the product of k divided by k-f over all non-zero

333
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,520
integers k is going to equal f times 2 pi divided by chord of f.

334
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:02,320
Put another way, since chord of f is 2 times the sine of f pi, this product is the same

335
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,520
as f times 2 pi divided by 2 times sine of f pi, which is f pi over sine of f pi.

336
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,640
Now rewriting this a little bit more, what you get is a pretty interesting fact.

337
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,320
Sine of f times pi is equal to f pi times this really big product, the product of 1-f

338
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,840
over k over all non-zero integers k.

339
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,360
So what we found is a way to express sine of x as an infinite product, which is really

340
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
cool if you think about it.

341
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,560
So not only does this proof give us the Wallace product, which is incredible in its own right,

342
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,320
it also generalizes to give us the product formula for the sine.

343
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,120
And what's neat about that is that it connects to how Euler originally solved the Basel problem,

344
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,300
the sum we saw in the previous video.

345
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,560
He was looking at this very infinite product for sine.

346
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,840
I mean connecting these formulas for pi to circles is one thing, but connecting them

347
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,700
to each other is another thing entirely.

348
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,560
And once again, if you want more details on all of this, check out the supplementary blog

350
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Thank you.
