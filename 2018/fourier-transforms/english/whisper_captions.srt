1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,840
This right here is what we're going to build to this video, a certain animated approach

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,740
to thinking about a super important idea from math, the Fourier transform.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,940
For anyone unfamiliar with what that is, my number one goal here is just for the video

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,960
to be an introduction to that topic.

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,920
But even for those of you who are already familiar with it, I still think that there's

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,800
something fun and enriching about seeing what all of its components actually look like.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,300
The central example to start is going to be the classic one, decomposing frequencies from sound.

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,860
But after that I also want to show a glimpse of how this idea extends well beyond sound

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,300
and frequency into many seemingly disparate areas of math, and even physics.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,140
Really, it's crazy just how ubiquitous this idea is.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,080
Let's dive in.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,580
This sound right here is a pure A, 440 beats per second, meaning if you were to measure

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,620
the air pressure right next to your headphones or your speaker as a function of time, it

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,440
would oscillate up and down around its usual equilibrium in this wave, making 440 oscillations

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,260
each second.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,760
A lower pitch note, like a D, has the same structure, just fewer beats per second.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,540
And when both of them are played at once, what do you think the resulting pressure vs.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,140
time graph looks like?

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,980
Well, at any point in time, this pressure difference is going to be the sum of what

20
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,880
it would be for each of those notes individually, which let's face it is kind of a complicated

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,780
thing to think about.

22
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,160
At some points the peaks match up with each other, resulting in a really high pressure.

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,940
At other points they tend to cancel out.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,660
And all in all, what you get is a wave-ish pressure vs. time graph that is not a pure

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,720
sine wave, it's something more complicated.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,160
And as you add in other notes, the wave gets more and more complicated.

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,340
But right now, all it is is a combination of four pure frequencies, so it seems needlessly

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,540
complicated given the low amount of information put into it.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,580
A microphone recording any sound just picks up on the air pressure at many different points

30
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,360
in time, it only sees the final sum.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,760
So our central question is going to be how you can take a signal like this and decompose

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,100
it into the pure frequencies that make it up.

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,840
Pretty interesting, right?

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,040
Adding up those signals really mixes them all together, so pulling them back apart feels

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,220
akin to unmixing multiple paint colors that have all been stirred up together.

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,860
The general strategy is going to be to build for ourselves a mathematical machine that

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,340
treats signals with a given frequency differently from how it treats other signals.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,220
To start, consider simply taking a pure signal, say with a lowly 3 beats per second, so we

39
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,260
can plot it easily.

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And let's limit ourselves to looking at a finite portion of this graph, in this case

41
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,940
the portion between 0 seconds and 4.5 seconds.

42
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,080
The key idea is to take this graph and sort of wrap it up around a circle.

43
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,640
Concretely, here's what I mean by that.

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,060
Imagine a little rotating vector where at each point in time its length is equal to

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,180
the height of our graph for that time.

46
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,060
So high points of the graph correspond to a greater distance from the origin, and low

47
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,000
points end up closer to the origin.

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,840
And right now I'm drawing it in such a way that moving forward 2 seconds in time corresponds

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,060
to a single rotation around the circle.

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,420
Our little vector drawing this wound up graph is rotating at half a cycle per second.

51
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,460
So this is important, there are two different frequencies at play here.

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
There's the frequency of our signal, which goes up and down 3 times per second, and then

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
separately there's the frequency with which we're wrapping the graph around the circle,

54
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,920
which at the moment is half of a rotation per second.

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,340
But we can adjust that second frequency however we want.

56
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,640
Maybe we want to wrap it around faster?

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,940
Or maybe we go and wrap it around slower?

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,580
And that choice of winding frequency determines what the wound up graph looks like.

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,640
Some of the diagrams that come out of this can be pretty complicated, although they are

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,340
very pretty, but it's important to keep in mind that all that's happening here is

61
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,400
that we're wrapping the signal around a circle.

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,000
The vertical lines that I'm drawing up top, by the way, are just a way to keep track of

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,600
the distance on the original graph that corresponds to a full rotation around the circle.

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,340
So lines spaced out by 1.5 seconds would mean it takes 1.5 seconds to make one full revolution.

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,140
And at this point we might have some sort of vague sense that something special will

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,220
happen when the winding frequency matches the frequency of our signal, 3 beats per second.

67
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,340
All of the high points on the graph happen on the right side of the circle, and all of

68
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,780
the low points happen on the left.

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,860
But how precisely can we take advantage of that in our attempt to build a frequency unmixing machine?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,080
Well, imagine this graph is having some kind of mass to it, like a metal wire.

71
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,560
This little dot is going to represent the center of mass of that wire.

72
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,020
As we change the frequency and the graph winds up differently, that center of mass kind of

73
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,080
wobbles around a bit.

74
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,040
And for most of the winding frequencies, the peaks and valleys are all spaced out around

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,660
the circle in such a way that the center of mass stays pretty close to the origin.

76
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,740
But when the winding frequency is the same as the frequency of our signal, in this case

77
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,880
3 cycles per second, all of the peaks are on the right, and all of the valleys are on

78
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,660
the left, so the center of mass is unusually far to the right.

79
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,640
Here, to capture this, let's draw some kind of plot that keeps track of where that center

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,460
of mass is for each winding frequency.

81
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course, the center of mass is a two-dimensional thing, it requires two coordinates to fully

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,820
keep track of, but for the moment, let's only keep track of the x-coordinate.

83
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,960
So for a frequency of zero, when everything is bunched up on the right, this x-coordinate

84
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,980
is relatively high.

85
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,500
And then as you increase that winding frequency, and the graph balances out around the circle,

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,160
the x-coordinate of that center of mass goes closer to zero, and it just kind of wobbles

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
around a bit.

88
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,160
But then, at 3 beats per second, there's a spike, as everything lines up to the right.

89
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,960
This right here is the central construct, so let's sum up what we have so far.

90
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,360
We have that original intensity vs time graph, and then we have the wound up version of that

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,540
in some two-dimensional plane, and then as a third thing, we have a plot for how the

92
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,520
winding frequency influences the center of mass of that graph.

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,020
And by the way, let's look back at those really low frequencies near zero.

94
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,060
This big spike around zero in our new frequency plot just corresponds to the fact that the

95
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,580
whole cosine wave is shifted up.

96
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,780
If I had chosen a signal that oscillates around zero, dipping into negative values, then as

97
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,840
we play around with various winding frequencies, this plot of the winding frequency vs center

98
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,400
of mass would only have a spike at the value of 3.

99
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,520
But negative values are a little bit weird and messy to think about, especially for a

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,660
first example, so let's just continue thinking in terms of the shifted up graph.

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,460
I just want you to understand that that spike around zero only corresponds to the shift.

102
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,260
Our main focus, as far as frequency decomposition is concerned, is that bump at 3.

103
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,040
This whole plot is what I'll call the almost Fourier transform of the original signal.

104
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,640
There's a couple small distinctions between this and the actual Fourier transform, which

105
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll get to in a couple minutes, but already you might be able to see how this machine

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,680
lets us pick out the frequency of a signal.

107
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,360
Just to play around with it a little bit more, take a different Fourier signal, let's say

108
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,880
with a lower frequency of 2 beats per second, and do the same thing.

109
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,200
Wind it around a circle, imagine different potential winding frequencies, and as you

110
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,340
do that keep track of where the center of mass of that graph is, and then plot the x

111
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,900
coordinate of that center of mass as you adjust the winding frequency.

112
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,380
Just like before, we get a spike when the winding frequency is the same as the signal

113
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,620
frequency, which in this case is when it equals 2 cycles per second.

114
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,100
But the real key point, the thing that makes this machine so delightful, is how it enables

115
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,800
us to take a signal consisting of multiple frequencies and pick out what they are.

116
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,920
Imagine taking the two signals we just looked at, the wave with 3 beats per second and the

117
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,840
wave with 2 beats per second, and add them up.

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,840
Like I said earlier, what you get is no longer a nice pure cosine wave, it's something

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,860
a little more complicated.

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,360
But imagine throwing this into our winding frequency machine.

121
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,420
It is certainly the case that as you wrap this thing around it looks a lot more complicated,

122
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,160
you have this chaos and chaos and chaos and chaos, and then whoop, things seem to line

123
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,180
up really nicely at 2 cycles per second.

124
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
Then as you continue on it's more chaos and more chaos and more chaos and chaos and

125
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,220
chaos and chaos, whoop, things nicely align again at 3 cycles per second.

126
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,600
And like I said before, the wound up graph can look kind of busy and complicated, but

127
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
all it is is the relatively simple idea of wrapping the graph around a circle.

128
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,140
It's just a more complicated graph and a pretty quick winding frequency.

129
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,500
Now what's going on here with the two different spikes is that if you were to take two signals

130
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,100
and then apply this almost Fourier transform to each of them individually, and then add

131
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,820
up the results, what you get is the same as if you first added up the signals and then

132
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,180
applied this almost Fourier transform.

133
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,600
And the attentive viewers among you might want to pause and ponder and convince yourself

134
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
that what I just said is actually true.

135
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,120
It's a pretty good test to verify for yourself that it's clear what exactly is being measured

136
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,920
inside this winding machine.

137
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,620
Now this property makes things really useful to us, because the transform of a pure frequency

138
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,540
is close to zero everywhere except for a spike around that frequency, so when you add together

139
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,740
two pure frequencies, the transform graph just has these little peaks above the frequencies

140
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,700
that went into it.

141
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,460
So this little mathematical machine does exactly what we wanted.

142
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,800
It pulls out the original frequencies from their jumbled up sums, unmixing the mixed

143
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
bucket of paint.

144
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,980
And before continuing into the full math that describes this operation, let's just get

145
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,260
a quick glimpse of one context where this thing is useful, sound editing.

146
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,400
Let's say that you have some recording and it's got an annoying high pitch that you

147
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,640
would like to filter out.

148
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,240
Well at first your signal is coming in as a function of various intensities over time,

149
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,060
different voltages given to your speaker from one millisecond to the next.

150
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,780
But we want to think of this in terms of frequencies.

151
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,020
So when you take the Fourier transform of that signal, the annoying high pitch is going

152
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,520
to show up just as a spike at some high frequency.

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,620
Filtering that out by just smushing the spike down, what you'd be looking at is the Fourier

154
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,400
transform of a sound that's just like your recording, only without that high frequency.

155
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,240
Luckily there's a notion of an inverse Fourier transform that tells you which signal would

156
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,560
have produced this as its Fourier transform.

157
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,440
I'll be talking about that inverse much more fully in the next video, but long story short,

158
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,880
applying the Fourier transform to the Fourier transform gives you back something close to

159
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,700
the original function.

160
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,400
Kind of, this is a little bit of a lie, but it's in the direction of truth.

161
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,200
And most of the reason it's a lie is that I still have yet to tell you what the actual

162
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,380
Fourier transform is, since it's a little more complex than this x-coordinate of the

163
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,420
center of mass idea.

164
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,460
First off, bringing back this wound up graph and looking at its center of mass, the x-coordinate

165
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,380
is really only half the story, right?

166
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,440
I mean, this thing is in two dimensions, it's got a y-coordinate as well.

167
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,400
And as is typical in math, whenever you're dealing with something two-dimensional, it's

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,800
elegant to think of it as the complex plane, where this center of mass is going to be a

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,100
complex number that has both a real and an imaginary part.

170
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,220
And the reason for talking in terms of complex numbers, rather than just saying it has two

171
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,180
coordinates, is that complex numbers lend themselves to really nice descriptions of

172
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,540
things that have to do with winding and rotation.

173
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,840
For example, Euler's formula famously tells us that if you take e to some number times

174
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,340
i, you're going to land on the point that you get if you were to walk that number of

175
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,900
units around a circle with radius 1 counterclockwise starting on the right.

176
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,200
So imagine you wanted to describe rotating at a rate of 1 cycle per second.

177
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,160
One thing you could do is take the expression e to the 2 pi times i times t, where t is

178
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,200
the amount of time that has passed, since for a circle with radius 1, 2 pi describes

179
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,740
the full length of its circumference.

180
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,640
And this is a little dizzying to look at, so maybe you want to describe a different

181
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,260
frequency, something lower and more reasonable, and for that you would just multiply that

182
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,540
time t in the exponent by the frequency f.

183
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,560
For example, if f was 1 tenth, then this vector makes one full turn every 10 seconds, since

184
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,940
the time t has to increase all the way to 10 before the full exponent looks like 2 pi

185
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,380
i.

186
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,000
I have another video giving some intuition on why this is the behavior of e to the x

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
for imaginary inputs, if you're curious, but for right now we're just going to take it

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,460
as a given.

189
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,180
Now why am I telling you this, you might ask?

190
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,480
Well it gives us a really nice way to write down the idea of winding up the graph into

191
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,060
a single tight little formula.

192
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,460
First off, the convention in the context of Fourier transforms is to think about rotating

193
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,300
in the clockwise direction, so let's throw a negative sign up into that exponent.

194
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,220
Now take some function describing a signal intensity versus time, like this pure cosine

195
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,920
wave we had before, and call it g of t.

196
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,260
If you multiply this exponential expression times g of t, it means that the rotating complex

197
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,540
number is getting scaled up and down according to the value of this function.

198
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,600
So you can think of this little rotating vector with its changing length as drawing the wound

199
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,220
up graph.

200
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,460
So think about it, this is awesome, this really small expression is a super elegant way to

201
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,840
encapsulate the whole idea of winding a graph around a circle with a variable frequency,

202
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,420
f.

203
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,740
And remember, the thing we want to do with this wound up graph is to track its center

204
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,860
of mass, so think about what formula is going to capture that.

205
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Well, to approximate it at least, you might sample a whole bunch of times from the original

206
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,100
signal, see where those points end up on the wound up graph, and then just take an average,

207
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,340
that is, add them all together as complex numbers, and then divide by the number of

208
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,300
points you've sampled.

209
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,180
This will become more accurate if you sample more points which are closer together.

210
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,340
And in the limit, rather than looking at the sum of a whole bunch of points divided by

211
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,860
the number of points, you take an integral of this function divided by the size of the

212
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,640
time interval we're looking at.

213
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,940
The idea of integrating a complex valued function might seem weird, and to anyone who's shaky

214
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,040
with calculus maybe even intimidating, but the underlying meaning here really doesn't

215
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,420
require any calculus knowledge.

216
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,480
The whole expression is just the center of mass of the wound up graph.

217
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,380
So great, step by step, we have built up this kind of complicated but let's face it, surprisingly

218
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,960
small expression for the whole winding machine idea I talked about, and now there is only

219
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,960
one final distinction to point out between this and the actual honest-to-goodness Fourier

220
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,920
transform, namely, just don't divide out by the time interval.

221
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,380
The Fourier transform is just the integral part of this.

222
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,100
What that means is that instead of looking at the center of mass, you would scale it

223
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,980
up by some amount.

224
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,140
If the portion of the original graph you were using spanned 3 seconds, you would multiply

225
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,360
the center of mass by 3.

226
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,720
If it was spanning 6 seconds, you would multiply the center of mass by 6.

227
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,640
Physically, this has the effect that when a certain frequency persists for a long time,

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,160
then the magnitude of the Fourier transform at that frequency is scaled up more and more.

229
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,240
For example, what we're looking at right here is how when you have a pure frequency

230
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,760
of 2 beats per second and you wind it around the graph at 2 cycles per second, the center

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:53,080
of mass stays in the same spot, but the longer that signal persists, the larger the value

232
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,880
of the Fourier transform at that frequency.

233
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,960
For other frequencies, even if you just increase it by a bit, this is cancelled out by the

234
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,500
fact that for longer time intervals, you're giving the wound-up graph more of a chance

235
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,220
to balance itself around the circle.

236
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,660
That is a lot of different moving parts, so let's step back and summarize what we have

237
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,160
so far.

238
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,760
The Fourier transform of an intensity vs. time function, like g of t, is a new function,

239
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,820
which doesn't have time as an input, but instead takes in a frequency, what I've

240
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,500
been calling the winding frequency.

241
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,220
In terms of notation, by the way, the common convention is to call this new function g-hat

242
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,380
with a little circumflex on top of it.

243
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,900
The output of this function is a complex number, some point in the 2d plane that corresponds

244
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,020
to the strength of a given frequency in the original signal.

245
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,580
The plot I've been graphing for the Fourier transform is just the real component of that

246
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,320
output, the x-coordinate, but you could also graph the imaginary component separately if

247
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,500
you wanted a fuller description.

248
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
And all of this is encapsulated inside that formula we built up.

249
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,440
And out of context, you can imagine how seeing this formula would seem sort of daunting,

250
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,880
but if you understand how exponentials correspond to rotation, how multiplying that by the function

251
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,880
g of t means drawing a wound up version of the graph, and how an integral of a complex

252
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,020
valued function can be interpreted in terms of a center of mass idea, you can see how

253
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,260
this whole thing carries with it a very rich intuitive meaning.

254
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,640
And by the way, one quick small note before we can call this wrapped up.

255
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,680
Even though in practice, with things like sound editing, you'll be integrating over

256
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,540
a finite time interval, the theory of Fourier transforms is often phrased where the bounds

257
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,300
of this integral are negative infinity and infinity.

258
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,020
Concretely, what that means is that you consider this expression for all possible finite time

259
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,020
intervals, and you just ask, what is its limit as that time interval grows to infinity?

260
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,040
And man oh man, there is so much more to say.

261
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,800
So much, I don't want to call it done here.

262
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,980
This transform extends to corners of math well beyond the idea of extracting frequencies

263
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,500
from signal.

264
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,940
So the next video I put out is going to go through a couple of these, and that's really

265
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,140
where things start getting interesting.

266
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,440
So stay subscribed for when that comes out, or an alternate option is to just binge on

267
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,340
a couple 3Blue and Brown videos so that the YouTube recommender is more inclined to show

268
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,500
you new things that come out.

269
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,760
Really the choice is yours.

270
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,360
And to close things off, I have something pretty fun, a mathematical puzzler from this

271
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,420
video's sponsor, Jane Street, who's looking to recruit more technical talent.

272
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,320
So let's say that you have a closed bounded convex set C sitting in 3D space, and then

273
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,440
let B be the boundary of that space, the surface of your complex blob.

274
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Now imagine taking every possible pair of points on that surface and adding them up,

275
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,100
doing a vector sum.

276
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Let's name this set of all possible sums D. Your task is to prove that D is also a

277
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,920
convex set.

278
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,260
So Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm, and if you're the kind of person who enjoys

279
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,900
math and solving puzzles like this, the team there really values intellectual curiosity,

280
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,020
so they might be interested in hiring you.

281
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,720
And they're looking both for full-time employees and interns.

282
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,240
For my part, I can say the couple of people I've interacted with there just seem to

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,480
love math and sharing math, and when they're hiring, they look less at a background in

284
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,220
finance than they do at how you think, how you learn, and how you solve problems, hence

285
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,240
the sponsorship of a 3Blue1Brown video.

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,480
If you want the answer to that puzzler, or to learn more about what they do, or to apply
