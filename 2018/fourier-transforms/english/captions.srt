1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,438
This right here is what we're going to build to this video, 

2
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:11,596
a certain animated approach to thinking about a super important idea from math, 

3
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:12,740
the Fourier transform.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,661
For anyone unfamiliar with what that is, my number one goal 

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,960
here is just for the video to be an introduction to that topic.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,283
But even for those of you who are already familiar with it, 

7
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:27,348
I still think that there's something fun and enriching about seeing what all of its 

8
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:28,800
components actually look like.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,484
The central example to start is going to be the classic one, 

10
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:34,300
decomposing frequencies from sound.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,540
But after that I also want to show a glimpse of how this idea extends well beyond 

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,300
sound and frequency into many seemingly disparate areas of math, and even physics.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,140
Really, it's crazy just how ubiquitous this idea is.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,080
Let's dive in.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,281
This sound right here is a pure A, 440 beats per second, 

16
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:58,702
meaning if you were to measure the air pressure right next to your 

17
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:02,001
headphones or your speaker as a function of time, 

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,884
it would oscillate up and down around its usual equilibrium in this wave, 

19
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:09,260
making 440 oscillations each second.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,760
A lower pitch note, like a D, has the same structure, just fewer beats per second.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,540
And when both of them are played at once, what do you think the resulting pressure vs.

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,140
time graph looks like?

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,544
Well, at any point in time, this pressure difference is going to 

24
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:29,242
be the sum of what it would be for each of those notes individually, 

25
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:32,780
which let's face it is kind of a complicated thing to think about.

26
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,160
At some points the peaks match up with each other, resulting in a really high pressure.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,940
At other points they tend to cancel out.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,780
And all in all, what you get is a wave-ish pressure vs.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
time graph that is not a pure sine wave, it's something more complicated.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,160
And as you add in other notes, the wave gets more and more complicated.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,735
But right now, all it is is a combination of four pure frequencies, 

32
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:02,540
so it seems needlessly complicated given the low amount of information put into it.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,852
A microphone recording any sound just picks up on the air pressure 

34
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,360
at many different points in time, it only sees the final sum.

35
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,258
So our central question is going to be how you can take a signal 

36
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:18,100
like this and decompose it into the pure frequencies that make it up.

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,840
Pretty interesting, right?

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,291
Adding up those signals really mixes them all together, 

39
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:27,671
so pulling them back apart feels akin to unmixing multiple paint colors that have 

40
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,220
all been stirred up together.

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,740
The general strategy is going to be to build for ourselves a mathematical machine that 

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,340
treats signals with a given frequency differently from how it treats other signals.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,213
To start, consider simply taking a pure signal, 

44
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:47,260
say with a lowly 3 beats per second, so we can plot it easily.

45
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,733
And let's limit ourselves to looking at a finite portion of this graph, 

46
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,940
in this case the portion between 0 seconds and 4.5 seconds.

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,080
The key idea is to take this graph and sort of wrap it up around a circle.

48
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,640
Concretely, here's what I mean by that.

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,600
Imagine a little rotating vector where at each point in time 

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,180
its length is equal to the height of our graph for that time.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,818
So high points of the graph correspond to a greater distance from the origin, 

52
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:21,000
and low points end up closer to the origin.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,517
And right now I'm drawing it in such a way that moving forward 2 

54
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:29,060
seconds in time corresponds to a single rotation around the circle.

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,420
Our little vector drawing this wound up graph is rotating at half a cycle per second.

56
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,460
So this is important, there are two different frequencies at play here.

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,963
There's the frequency of our signal, which goes up and down 3 times per second, 

58
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:47,100
and then separately there's the frequency with which we're wrapping the graph 

59
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,920
around the circle, which at the moment is half of a rotation per second.

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,340
But we can adjust that second frequency however we want.

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,640
Maybe we want to wrap it around faster?

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,940
Or maybe we go and wrap it around slower?

63
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,580
And that choice of winding frequency determines what the wound up graph looks like.

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,140
Some of the diagrams that come out of this can be pretty complicated, 

65
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,163
although they are very pretty, but it's important to keep in mind that 

66
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:18,399
all that's happening here is that we're wrapping the signal around a circle.

67
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,611
The vertical lines that I'm drawing up top, by the way, 

68
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:27,917
are just a way to keep track of the distance on the original graph that corresponds to 

69
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,600
a full rotation around the circle.

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,534
So lines spaced out by 1.5 seconds would mean 

71
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,340
it takes 1.5 seconds to make one full revolution.

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,601
And at this point we might have some sort of vague sense that something special will 

73
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:46,220
happen when the winding frequency matches the frequency of our signal, 3 beats per second.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,927
All of the high points on the graph happen on the right side of the circle, 

75
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,780
and all of the low points happen on the left.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,206
But how precisely can we take advantage of that in 

77
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:57,860
our attempt to build a frequency unmixing machine?

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,080
Well, imagine this graph is having some kind of mass to it, like a metal wire.

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,560
This little dot is going to represent the center of mass of that wire.

80
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,481
As we change the frequency and the graph winds up differently, 

81
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:14,080
that center of mass kind of wobbles around a bit.

82
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,787
And for most of the winding frequencies, the peaks and valleys are all spaced out 

83
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:23,660
around the circle in such a way that the center of mass stays pretty close to the origin.

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,545
But when the winding frequency is the same as the frequency of our signal, 

85
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:34,451
in this case 3 cycles per second, all of the peaks are on the right, 

86
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,924
and all of the valleys are on the left, so the center of mass is unusually far 

87
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:39,660
to the right.

88
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,331
Here, to capture this, let's draw some kind of plot that keeps 

89
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:48,460
track of where that center of mass is for each winding frequency.

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,835
Of course, the center of mass is a two-dimensional thing, 

91
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:54,983
it requires two coordinates to fully keep track of, but for the moment, 

92
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:56,820
let's only keep track of the x-coordinate.

93
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,146
So for a frequency of zero, when everything is bunched up on the right, 

94
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:02,980
this x-coordinate is relatively high.

95
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,411
And then as you increase that winding frequency, 

96
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,009
and the graph balances out around the circle, the x-coordinate of 

97
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:14,480
that center of mass goes closer to zero, and it just kind of wobbles around a bit.

98
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,160
But then, at 3 beats per second, there's a spike, as everything lines up to the right.

99
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,960
This right here is the central construct, so let's sum up what we have so far.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,811
We have that original intensity vs time graph, 

101
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:55,482
and then we have the wound up version of that in some two-dimensional plane, 

102
00:06:55,482 --> 00:07:00,518
and then as a third thing, we have a plot for how the winding frequency influences 

103
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,520
the center of mass of that graph.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,020
And by the way, let's look back at those really low frequencies near zero.

105
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,368
This big spike around zero in our new frequency plot just 

106
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:15,580
corresponds to the fact that the whole cosine wave is shifted up.

107
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,983
If I had chosen a signal that oscillates around zero, dipping into negative values, 

108
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,514
then as we play around with various winding frequencies, 

109
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:30,284
this plot of the winding frequency vs center of mass would only have a spike 

110
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,400
at the value of 3.

111
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,903
But negative values are a little bit weird and messy to think about, 

112
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:39,826
especially for a first example, so let's just continue thinking in terms of the 

113
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,660
shifted up graph.

114
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,460
I just want you to understand that that spike around zero only corresponds to the shift.

115
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,260
Our main focus, as far as frequency decomposition is concerned, is that bump at 3.

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,040
This whole plot is what I'll call the almost Fourier transform of the original signal.

117
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,469
There's a couple small distinctions between this and the actual Fourier transform, 

118
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,757
which I'll get to in a couple minutes, but already you might be able to 

119
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:06,680
see how this machine lets us pick out the frequency of a signal.

120
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Just to play around with it a little bit more, take a different Fourier signal, 

121
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,880
let's say with a lower frequency of 2 beats per second, and do the same thing.

122
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,548
Wind it around a circle, imagine different potential winding frequencies, 

123
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:24,830
and as you do that keep track of where the center of mass of that graph is, 

124
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,900
and then plot the x coordinate of that center of mass as you adjust the winding frequency.

125
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,495
Just like before, we get a spike when the winding frequency is the same as 

126
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:38,620
the signal frequency, which in this case is when it equals 2 cycles per second.

127
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,539
But the real key point, the thing that makes this machine so delightful, 

128
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,063
is how it enables us to take a signal consisting of multiple frequencies and pick out 

129
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:48,800
what they are.

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,648
Imagine taking the two signals we just looked at, 

131
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:55,840
the wave with 3 beats per second and the wave with 2 beats per second, and add them up.

132
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,958
Like I said earlier, what you get is no longer a nice pure cosine wave, 

133
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,860
it's something a little more complicated.

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,360
But imagine throwing this into our winding frequency machine.

135
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,529
It is certainly the case that as you wrap this thing around it looks a 

136
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,787
lot more complicated, you have this chaos and chaos and chaos and chaos, 

137
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:16,180
and then whoop, things seem to line up really nicely at 2 cycles per second.

138
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,032
Then as you continue on it's more chaos and more chaos and more chaos and chaos 

139
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:23,220
and chaos and chaos, whoop, things nicely align again at 3 cycles per second.

140
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,610
And like I said before, the wound up graph can look kind of busy and complicated, 

141
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,440
but all it is is the relatively simple idea of wrapping the graph around a circle.

142
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,140
It's just a more complicated graph and a pretty quick winding frequency.

143
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,738
Now what's going on here with the two different spikes is that if you were to 

144
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:45,296
take two signals and then apply this almost Fourier transform to each of them 

145
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:49,855
individually, and then add up the results, what you get is the same as if you 

146
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:54,180
first added up the signals and then applied this almost Fourier transform.

147
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,590
And the attentive viewers among you might want to pause and ponder 

148
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,240
and convince yourself that what I just said is actually true.

149
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,999
It's a pretty good test to verify for yourself that it's clear 

150
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,920
what exactly is being measured inside this winding machine.

151
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,970
Now this property makes things really useful to us, 

152
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,250
because the transform of a pure frequency is close to zero everywhere except 

153
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,808
for a spike around that frequency, so when you add together two pure frequencies, 

154
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:25,700
the transform graph just has these little peaks above the frequencies that went into it.

155
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,460
So this little mathematical machine does exactly what we wanted.

156
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,562
It pulls out the original frequencies from their jumbled up sums, 

157
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:35,600
unmixing the mixed bucket of paint.

158
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,190
And before continuing into the full math that describes this operation, 

159
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,260
let's just get a quick glimpse of one context where this thing is useful, sound editing.

160
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,192
Let's say that you have some recording and it's got an 

161
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:49,640
annoying high pitch that you would like to filter out.

162
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,199
Well at first your signal is coming in as a function of various intensities over time, 

163
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:59,060
different voltages given to your speaker from one millisecond to the next.

164
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,780
But we want to think of this in terms of frequencies.

165
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,768
So when you take the Fourier transform of that signal, 

166
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:10,520
the annoying high pitch is going to show up just as a spike at some high frequency.

167
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,929
Filtering that out by just smushing the spike down, 

168
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:18,158
what you'd be looking at is the Fourier transform of a sound that's just like your 

169
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,400
recording, only without that high frequency.

170
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,976
Luckily there's a notion of an inverse Fourier transform that tells 

171
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,560
you which signal would have produced this as its Fourier transform.

172
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,855
I'll be talking about that inverse much more fully in the next video, 

173
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:36,328
but long story short, applying the Fourier transform to the Fourier 

174
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,700
transform gives you back something close to the original function.

175
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,400
Kind of, this is a little bit of a lie, but it's in the direction of truth.

176
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,852
And most of the reason it's a lie is that I still have yet to 

177
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:50,226
tell you what the actual Fourier transform is, 

178
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:54,420
since it's a little more complex than this x-coordinate of the center of mass idea.

179
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,559
First off, bringing back this wound up graph and looking at its center of mass, 

180
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,380
the x-coordinate is really only half the story, right?

181
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,440
I mean, this thing is in two dimensions, it's got a y-coordinate as well.

182
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,201
And as is typical in math, whenever you're dealing with something two-dimensional, 

183
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:12,816
it's elegant to think of it as the complex plane, 

184
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,949
where this center of mass is going to be a complex number that has both a real 

185
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,100
and an imaginary part.

186
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,740
And the reason for talking in terms of complex numbers, 

187
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,968
rather than just saying it has two coordinates, 

188
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:29,265
is that complex numbers lend themselves to really nice descriptions of 

189
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,540
things that have to do with winding and rotation.

190
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,657
For example, Euler's formula famously tells us that if you take e to some number times i, 

191
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:42,485
you're going to land on the point that you get if you were to walk that number of 

192
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:46,900
units around a circle with radius 1 counterclockwise starting on the right.

193
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,200
So imagine you wanted to describe rotating at a rate of 1 cycle per second.

194
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,139
One thing you could do is take the expression e to the 2 pi times i times t, 

195
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:04,377
where t is the amount of time that has passed, since for a circle with radius 1, 

196
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:07,740
2 pi describes the full length of its circumference.

197
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,793
And this is a little dizzying to look at, so maybe you want to describe 

198
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,021
a different frequency, something lower and more reasonable, 

199
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:20,540
and for that you would just multiply that time t in the exponent by the frequency f.

200
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,019
For example, if f was 1 tenth, then this vector makes one full turn every 10 seconds, 

201
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:33,041
since the time t has to increase all the way to 10 before the full exponent looks like 2 

202
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,380
pi i.

203
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,297
I have another video giving some intuition on why this is the 

204
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:40,557
behavior of e to the x for imaginary inputs, if you're curious, 

205
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:43,460
but for right now we're just going to take it as a given.

206
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,180
Now why am I telling you this, you might ask?

207
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,802
Well it gives us a really nice way to write down the idea 

208
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:53,060
of winding up the graph into a single tight little formula.

209
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,384
First off, the convention in the context of Fourier transforms is to think about 

210
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:03,300
rotating in the clockwise direction, so let's throw a negative sign up into that exponent.

211
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,346
Now take some function describing a signal intensity versus time, 

212
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:11,920
like this pure cosine wave we had before, and call it g of t.

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,437
If you multiply this exponential expression times g of t, 

214
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:21,827
it means that the rotating complex number is getting scaled up and down according to 

215
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,540
the value of this function.

216
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,229
So you can think of this little rotating vector with 

217
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:30,220
its changing length as drawing the wound up graph.

218
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,284
So think about it, this is awesome, this really small expression 

219
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:38,699
is a super elegant way to encapsulate the whole idea of 

220
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,420
winding a graph around a circle with a variable frequency, f.

221
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,140
And remember, the thing we want to do with this wound up graph is to track 

222
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,860
its center of mass, so think about what formula is going to capture that.

223
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,980
Well, to approximate it at least, you might sample a whole bunch of times 

224
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,486
from the original signal, see where those points end up on the wound up graph, 

225
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:05,163
and then just take an average, that is, add them all together as complex numbers, 

226
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:08,300
and then divide by the number of points you've sampled.

227
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,180
This will become more accurate if you sample more points which are closer together.

228
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,050
And in the limit, rather than looking at the sum of a whole bunch of 

229
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,901
points divided by the number of points, you take an integral of this 

230
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:25,640
function divided by the size of the time interval we're looking at.

231
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,317
The idea of integrating a complex valued function might seem weird, 

232
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:32,545
and to anyone who's shaky with calculus maybe even intimidating, 

233
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:36,420
but the underlying meaning here really doesn't require any calculus knowledge.

234
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,480
The whole expression is just the center of mass of the wound up graph.

235
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,695
So great, step by step, we have built up this kind of complicated but let's face it, 

236
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:51,531
surprisingly small expression for the whole winding machine idea I talked about, 

237
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:56,606
and now there is only one final distinction to point out between this and the actual 

238
00:15:56,606 --> 00:16:01,920
honest-to-goodness Fourier transform, namely, just don't divide out by the time interval.

239
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,380
The Fourier transform is just the integral part of this.

240
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,320
What that means is that instead of looking at the center of mass, 

241
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,980
you would scale it up by some amount.

242
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,210
If the portion of the original graph you were using spanned 3 seconds, 

243
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,360
you would multiply the center of mass by 3.

244
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,720
If it was spanning 6 seconds, you would multiply the center of mass by 6.

245
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,071
Physically, this has the effect that when a certain frequency persists for a long time, 

246
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:35,160
then the magnitude of the Fourier transform at that frequency is scaled up more and more.

247
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,822
For example, what we're looking at right here is how when you have a pure 

248
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:46,573
frequency of 2 beats per second and you wind it around the graph at 2 cycles per second, 

249
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:51,743
the center of mass stays in the same spot, but the longer that signal persists, 

250
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,880
the larger the value of the Fourier transform at that frequency.

251
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,605
For other frequencies, even if you just increase it by a bit, 

252
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:02,911
this is cancelled out by the fact that for longer time intervals, 

253
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:07,220
you're giving the wound-up graph more of a chance to balance itself around the circle.

254
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,716
That is a lot of different moving parts, so let's 

255
00:17:11,716 --> 00:17:14,160
step back and summarize what we have so far.

256
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,540
The Fourier transform of an intensity vs.

257
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,750
time function, like g of t, is a new function, which doesn't have time as an input, 

258
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,500
but instead takes in a frequency, what I've been calling the winding frequency.

259
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,900
In terms of notation, by the way, the common convention is to 

260
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,380
call this new function g-hat with a little circumflex on top of it.

261
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,780
The output of this function is a complex number, 

262
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,040
some point in the 2d plane that corresponds to the strength of a given 

263
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,020
frequency in the original signal.

264
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,589
The plot I've been graphing for the Fourier transform is just the real 

265
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,020
component of that output, the x-coordinate, but you could also graph 

266
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,500
the imaginary component separately if you wanted a fuller description.

267
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
And all of this is encapsulated inside that formula we built up.

268
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,017
And out of context, you can imagine how seeing this formula would seem sort of daunting, 

269
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:10,625
but if you understand how exponentials correspond to rotation, 

270
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:15,435
how multiplying that by the function g of t means drawing a wound up version of the 

271
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:20,246
graph, and how an integral of a complex valued function can be interpreted in terms 

272
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:25,229
of a center of mass idea, you can see how this whole thing carries with it a very rich 

273
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,260
intuitive meaning.

274
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,640
And by the way, one quick small note before we can call this wrapped up.

275
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,777
Even though in practice, with things like sound editing, 

276
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:36,334
you'll be integrating over a finite time interval, 

277
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:40,094
the theory of Fourier transforms is often phrased where the bounds of this 

278
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:42,300
integral are negative infinity and infinity.

279
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,688
Concretely, what that means is that you consider this expression 

280
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:49,854
for all possible finite time intervals, and you just ask, 

281
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:53,020
what is its limit as that time interval grows to infinity?

282
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,040
And man oh man, there is so much more to say.

283
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,800
So much, I don't want to call it done here.

284
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,083
This transform extends to corners of math well 

285
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,500
beyond the idea of extracting frequencies from signal.

286
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,940
So the next video I put out is going to go through a couple of these, 

287
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,140
and that's really where things start getting interesting.

288
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,104
So stay subscribed for when that comes out, or an alternate option 

289
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:16,070
is to just binge on a couple 3Blue and Brown videos so that the 

290
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,500
YouTube recommender is more inclined to show you new things that come out.

291
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,760
Really the choice is yours.

292
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,201
And to close things off, I have something pretty fun, 

293
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:28,190
a mathematical puzzler from this video's sponsor, Jane Street, 

294
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,420
who's looking to recruit more technical talent.

295
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,287
So let's say that you have a closed bounded convex set C sitting in 3D space, 

296
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:41,440
and then let B be the boundary of that space, the surface of your complex blob.

297
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,022
Now imagine taking every possible pair of points on that surface and adding them up, 

298
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,100
doing a vector sum.

299
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,320
Let's name this set of all possible sums D.

300
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,920
Your task is to prove that D is also a convex set.

301
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,490
So Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm, 

302
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,389
and if you're the kind of person who enjoys math and solving puzzles like this, 

303
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:05,972
the team there really values intellectual curiosity, 

304
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,020
so they might be interested in hiring you.

305
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,720
And they're looking both for full-time employees and interns.

306
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,480
For my part, I can say the couple of people I've interacted with there just 

307
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,162
seem to love math and sharing math, and when they're hiring, 

308
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:20,371
they look less at a background in finance than they do at how you think, 

309
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,240
how you learn, and how you solve problems, hence the sponsorship of a 3Blue1Brown video.

310
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,281
If you want the answer to that puzzler, or to learn more about what they do, 

311
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:32,840

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,800
Thank you.
