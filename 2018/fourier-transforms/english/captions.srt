1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
This right here is what we're going to build to this video, a certain animated approach

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,540
to thinking about a super important idea from math, the Fourier transform.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,920
For anyone unfamiliar with what that is, my number one goal here is just for the video

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
to be an introduction to that topic.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,960
But even for those of you who are already familiar with it, I still think that there's

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,520
something fun and enriching about seeing what all of its components actually look like.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,640
The central example to start is going to be the classic one, decomposing frequencies

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,820
from sound.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,860
But after that I also want to show a glimpse of how this idea extends well beyond sound

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,000
and frequency into many seemingly disparate areas of math, and even physics.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,560
Really it's crazy just how ubiquitous this idea is.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,760
Let's dive in.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,500
This sound right here is a pure A, 440 beats per second, meaning if you were to measure

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,580
the air pressure right next to your headphones or your speaker as a function of time, it

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:08,540
would oscillate up and down around its usual equilibrium in this wave, making 440 oscillations

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
each second.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,780
A lower pitch note, like a D, has the same structure, just fewer beats per second.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,820
And when both of them are played at once, what do you think the resulting pressure vs.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
time graph looks like?

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,360
At any point in time, this pressure difference is going to be the sum of what it would be

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,060
for each of those notes individually, which let's face it is kind of a complicated thing

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,380
to think about.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,020
At some points the peaks match up with each other, resulting in a really high pressure.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,580
At other points they tend to cancel out.

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,580
And all in all, what you get is a wave-ish pressure vs. time graph that is not a pure

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,540
sine wave, it's something more complicated.

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,380
And as you add in other notes, the wave gets more and more complicated.

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,300
But right now, all it is is a combination of four pure frequencies, so it seems needlessly

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,140
complicated given the low amount of information put into it.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,560
A microphone recording any sound just picks up on the air pressure at many different points

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,780
in time, it only sees the final sum.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,720
So our central question is going to be how you can take a signal like this and decompose

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,900
it into the pure frequencies that make it up.

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,420
Pretty interesting, right?

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,000
Adding up those signals really mixes them all together, so pulling them back apart feels

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,940
akin to unmixing multiple paint colors that have all been stirred up together.

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,780
The general strategy is going to be to build for ourselves a mathematical machine that

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,580
treats signals with a given frequency differently from how it treats other signals.

39
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,080
To start, consider simply taking a pure signal, say with a lowly 3 beats per second so that

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,860
we can plot it easily.

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,900
And let's limit ourselves to looking at a finite portion of this graph, in this case

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,660
the portion between 0 seconds and 4.5 seconds.

43
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,380
The key idea is going to be to take this graph and sort of wrap it up around a circle.

44
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,040
Concretely, here's what I mean by that.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,000
Imagine a little rotating vector where at each point in time, its length is equal to

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,820
the height of our graph for that time.

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,620
High points of the graph correspond to a greater distance from the origin, and low points end

48
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,220
up closer to the origin.

49
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,920
Right now I'm drawing it in such a way that moving forward 2 seconds in time corresponds

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,860
to a single rotation around the circle.

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,680
Our little vector drawing this wound up graph is rotating at half a cycle per second.

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,000
This is important, there are two different frequencies at play here.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,380
There's the frequency of our signal, which goes up and down 3 times per second, and then

54
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,480
Separately, there's the frequency with which we're wrapping the graph around the circle,

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,660
which at the moment is half of a rotation per second.

56
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,840
But we can adjust that second frequency however we want.

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,320
Maybe we want to wrap it around faster?

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,800
Or maybe we go and wrap it around slower?

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,160
And that choice of winding frequency determines what the wound up graph looks like.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,560
Some of the diagrams that come out of this can be pretty complicated, although they are

61
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,420
very pretty, but it's important to keep in mind that all that's happening here is that

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,160
we're wrapping the signal around a circle.

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,000
The vertical lines that I'm drawing up top, by the way, are just a way to keep track of

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,860
the distance on the original graph that corresponds to a full rotation around the circle.

65
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,280
So lines spaced out by 1.5 seconds would mean it takes 1.5 seconds to make one full revolution.

66
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,020
And at this point we might have some sort of vague sense that something special will

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,980
happen when the winding frequency matches the frequency of our signal, 3 beats per second.

68
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,300
All of the high points on the graph happen on the right side of the circle, and all of

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,600
the low points happen on the left.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,880
But how precisely can we take advantage of that in our attempt to build a frequency unmixing machine?

71
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,420
Well, imagine this graph as having some kind of mass to it, like a metal wire.

72
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,320
This little dot is going to represent the center of mass of that wire.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,480
As we change the frequency and the graph winds up differently, that center of mass

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,500
kind of wobbles around a bit.

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,020
And for most of the winding frequencies, the peaks and valleys are all spaced out around

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,260
the circle in such a way that the center of mass stays pretty close to the origin.

77
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,840
But when the winding frequency is the same as the frequency of our signal, in this case

78
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,780
3 cycles per second, all of the peaks are on the right and all of the valleys are on

79
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,860
the left, so the center of mass is unusually far to the right.

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,600
Here, to capture this, let's draw some kind of plot that keeps track of where that center

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,240
of mass is for each winding frequency.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,960
Of course, the center of mass is a two-dimensional thing, it requires two coordinates to fully

83
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,600
keep track of, but for the moment let's only keep track of the x-coordinate.

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,940
So for a frequency of zero, when everything is bunched up on the right, this x-coordinate

85
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,840
is relatively high.

86
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,180
As you increase the winding frequency, and the graph balances out around the circle,

87
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,460
the x-coordinate of that center of mass goes closer to zero, and it just wobbles around

88
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:27,420
a bit.

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:44,880
But then, at 3 beats per second, there's a spike, as everything lines up to the right.

90
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,400
This right here is the central construct, so let's sum up what we have so far.

91
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,480
We have that original intensity vs time graph, and then we have the wound up version of that

92
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,940
in some two-dimensional plane, and then as a third thing we have a plot for how the winding

93
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,980
frequency influences the center of mass of that graph.

94
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,860
And by the way, let's look back at those really low frequencies near zero.

95
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,940
This big spike around zero in our new frequency plot just corresponds to the fact that the

96
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,800
whole cosine wave is shifted up.

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,700
If I had chosen a signal that oscillates around zero, dipping into negative values, then as

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,820
we play around with various winding frequencies, this plot of the winding frequency vs center

99
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,800
of mass would only have a spike at the value of 3.

100
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
But negative values are a little bit weird and messy to think about, especially for a

101
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,840
first example, so let's just continue thinking in terms of the shifted up graph.

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,040
I just want you to understand that that spike around zero only corresponds to the shift.

103
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,520
Our main focus, as far as frequency decomposition is concerned, is that bump at 3.

104
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,260
This whole plot is what I'll call the almost Fourier transform of the original signal.

105
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,980
There's a couple small distinctions between this and the Fourier transform, which I'll

106
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,020
get to in a couple minutes, but already you might be able to see how this machine lets

107
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,000
us pick out the frequency of a signal.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,240
Just to play around with it a little bit more, take a different pure signal, let's say

109
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
with a lower frequency of 2 beats per second, and do the same thing.

110
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,120
Wind it around a circle, imagine different potential winding frequencies, and as you

111
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,200
do that keep track of where the center of mass of that graph is, and then plot the x

112
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,960
coordinate of that center of mass as you adjust the winding frequency.

113
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,320
Just like before, we get a spike when the winding frequency is the same as the signal

114
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,740
frequency, which in this case is when it equals 2 cycles per second.

115
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,060
But the real key point, the thing that makes this machine so delightful, is how it enables

116
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,460
us to take a signal consisting of multiple frequencies and pick out what they are.

117
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,840
Imagine taking the two signals we just looked at, the wave with 3 beats per second and the

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,980
wave with 2 beats per second, and add them up.

119
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,800
Like I said earlier, what you get is no longer a nice pure cosine wave, it's something

120
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,520
a little more complicated.

121
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,360
But imagine throwing this into our winding frequency machine.

122
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,240
It is certainly the case that as you wrap this thing around it looks a lot more complicated,

123
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,100
you have this chaos and chaos and chaos and chaos, and then whoop, things seem to line

124
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,800
up really nicely at 2 cycles per second, and as you continue on it's more chaos and more

125
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,980
chaos and more chaos and chaos and chaos and chaos, whoop, things nicely align again

126
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
at 3 cycles per second.

127
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,680
And like I said before, the wound up graph can look kind of busy and complicated, but

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,020
all it is is the relatively simple idea of wrapping the graph around a circle.

129
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,180
It's just a more complicated graph and a pretty quick winding frequency.

130
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,900
Now what's going on here with the two different spikes is that if you were to take two signals

131
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,000
and then apply this almost Fourier transform to each of them individually, and then add

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,060
up the results, what you get is the same as if you first added up the signals and then

133
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,780
applied this almost Fourier transform.

134
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,580
And the attentive viewers among you might want to pause and ponder and convince yourself

135
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,900
that what I just said is actually true.

136
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,420
It's a pretty good test to verify for yourself that it's clear what exactly is being measured

137
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,060
inside this winding machine.

138
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,040
Now this property makes things really useful to us, because the transform of a pure frequency

139
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,500
is close to zero everywhere except for a spike around that frequency, so when you add together

140
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,780
two pure frequencies, the transform graph just has these little peaks above the frequencies

141
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,500
that went into it.

142
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,040
So this little mathematical machine does exactly what we wanted.

143
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,780
It pulls out the original frequencies from their jumbled up sums, unmixing the mixed

144
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,960
bucket of paint.

145
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,000
And before continuing into the full math that describes this operation, let's just get a

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,900
quick glimpse of one context where this thing is useful, sound editing.

147
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,440
Let's say you have some recording and it's got an annoying high pitch that you would

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,820
like to filter out.

149
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,660
Well at first your signal is coming in as a function of various intensities over time,

150
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,300
different voltages given to your speaker from one millisecond to the next, but we want to

151
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,660
think of this in terms of frequencies.

152
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,940
So when you take the Fourier transform of that signal, the annoying high pitch is going

153
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,580
to show up just as a spike at some high frequency.

154
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,520
Filtering that out by just smooshing the spike down, what you'd be looking at is the Fourier

155
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,320
transform of a sound that's just like your recording only without that high frequency.

156
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,200
Luckily there's a notion of an inverse Fourier transform that tells you which signal would

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,180
have produced this as its Fourier transform.

158
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,680
I'll be talking about that inverse much more fully in the next video, but long story short,

159
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,820
applying the Fourier transform to the Fourier transform gives you back something close to

160
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,300
the original function.

161
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,940
Kind of, this is a little bit of a lie, but it's in the direction of truth.

162
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,660
And most of the reason that it's a lie is that I still have yet to tell you what the

163
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,080
actual Fourier transform is, since it's a little more complex than this x-coordinate

164
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,540
of the center of mass idea.

165
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,500
First off, bringing back this wound up graph and looking at its center of mass, the x-coordinate

166
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,820
is really only half the story, right?

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,040
This thing is in two dimensions, it's got a y-coordinate as well.

168
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,440
And as is typical in math, whenever you're dealing with something two-dimensional, it's

169
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,600
elegant to think of it as the complex plane, where this center of mass is going to be a

170
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,660
complex number that has both a real and an imaginary part.

171
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,120
And the reason for talking in terms of complex numbers, rather than just saying it has two

172
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
coordinates, is that complex numbers lend themselves to really nice descriptions of

173
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,460
things that have to do with winding and rotation.

174
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,920
For example, Euler's formula famously tells us that if you take e to some number times

175
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,220
i, you're going to land on the point that you get if you were to walk that number of

176
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,960
units around a circle with radius 1 counterclockwise starting on the right.

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,280
So imagine you wanted to describe rotating at a rate of one cycle per second.

178
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,100
One thing that you could do is take the expression e to the 2 pi times i times t, where t is

179
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,200
the amount of time that has passed, since for a circle with radius 1, 2 pi describes

180
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,240
the full length of its circumference.

181
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,640
And this is a little bit dizzying to look at, so maybe you want to describe a different

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,220
frequency, something lower and more reasonable, and for that you would just multiply that

183
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,380
time t in the exponent by the frequency f.

184
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,520
For example, if f was 1 tenth, then this vector makes one full turn every 10 seconds, since

185
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,800
the time t has to increase all the way to 10 before the full exponent looks like 2 pi

186
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,440
i.

187
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,980
I have another video giving some intuition on why this is the behavior of e to the x

188
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,980
for imaginary inputs, if you're curious, but for right now we're just going to take it

189
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
as a given.

190
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,720
Now, why am I telling you this, you might ask?

191
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,480
Well it gives us a really nice way to write down the idea of winding up the graph into

192
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,180
a single, tight little formula.

193
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,480
First off, the convention in the context of Fourier transforms is to think about rotating

194
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,500
in the clockwise direction, so let's throw a negative sign up into that exponent.

195
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,140
Now take some function describing a signal intensity versus time, like this pure cosine

196
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,980
wave we had before, and call it g of t.

197
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,240
If you multiply this exponential expression times g of t, it means that the rotating complex

198
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,540
number is getting scaled up and down according to the value of this function.

199
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,600
So you can think of this little rotating vector with its changing length as drawing the wound

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,320
up graph.

201
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,340
So think about it, this is awesome, this really small expression is a super elegant way to

202
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,280
encapsulate the whole idea of winding a graph around a circle with a variable frequency,

203
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
f.

204
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,720
And remember, the thing we want to do with this wound up graph is to track its center

205
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,560
of mass, so think about what formula is going to capture that.

206
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,160
Well, to approximate it at least, you might sample a whole bunch of times from the original

207
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,600
signal, see where those points end up on the wound up graph, and then just take an average,

208
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,280
that is, add them all together as complex numbers, and then divide by the number of

209
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,240
points you've sampled.

210
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,340
This will become more accurate if you sample more points which are closer together.

211
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,180
And in the limit, rather than looking at the sum of a whole bunch of points divided

212
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,780
by the number of points, you take an integral of this function divided by the size of the

213
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,100
time interval we're looking at.

214
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,940
The idea of integrating a complex valued function might seem weird, and to anyone who's shaky

215
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,060
with calculus maybe even intimidating, but the underlying meaning here really doesn't

216
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,580
require any calculus knowledge, the whole expression is just the center of mass of the

217
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,620
wound up graph.

218
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,740
So great, step by step, we have built up this kind of complicated but let's face

219
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,160
it, surprisingly small expression for the whole winding machine idea I talked about.

220
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,100
And now there is only one final distinction to point out between this and the actual honest

221
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,620
to goodness Fourier transform, namely, just don't divide out by the time interval.

222
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,420
The Fourier transform is just the integral part of this.

223
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,060
What that means is that instead of looking at the center of mass, you would scale it

224
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,820
up by some amount.

225
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,120
If the portion of the original graph you were using spanned 3 seconds, you would multiply

226
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,740
the center of mass by 3.

227
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,580
If it was spanning 6 seconds, you would multiply the center of mass by 6.

228
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,100
Physically, this has the effect that when a certain frequency persists for a long time,

229
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,240
then the magnitude of the Fourier transform at that frequency is scaled up more and more.

230
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,760
For example, what we're looking at here is how when you have a pure frequency of

231
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,740
2 beats per second and you wind it around the graph at 2 cycles per second, the center

232
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,800
of mass stays in the same spot, just tracing out the same shape.

233
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,340
But the longer that signal persists, the larger the value of the Fourier transform at that

234
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,580
frequency.

235
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,500
For other frequencies though, even if you just increase it by a bit, this is cancelled

236
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,000
out by the fact that for longer time intervals, you're giving the wound up graph more of

237
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,440
a chance to balance itself around the circle.

238
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,620
That is a lot of different moving parts, so let's step back and summarize what we have

239
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,800
so far.

240
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,240
The Fourier transform of an intensity vs time function, like g of t, is a new function,

241
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,840
which doesn't have time as an input, but instead takes in a frequency, what I've

242
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,720
been calling the winding frequency.

243
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,580
In terms of notation, by the way, the common convention is to call this new function g-hat,

244
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,020
with a little circumflex on top of it.

245
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:42,020
The output of this function is a complex number, some point in the 2d plane that corresponds

246
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,040
to the strength of a given frequency in the original signal.

247
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,540
The plot I've been graphing for the Fourier transform is just the real component of that

248
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,280
output, the x-coordinate, but you could also graph the imaginary component separately if

249
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,580
you wanted a fuller description.

250
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,060
And all of this is encapsulated inside that formula we built up.

251
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,220
Out of context, you can imagine how seeing this formula would seem daunting, but if you

252
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,980
understand how exponentials correspond to rotation, how multiplying that by the function

253
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,820
g of t means drawing a wound up version of the graph, and how an integral of a complex

254
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,940
valued function can be interpreted in terms of a center of mass idea, you can see how

255
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,620
this whole thing carries with it a very rich intuitive meaning.

256
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,240
By the way, one quick small note before we can call this wrapped up.

257
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,620
Even though in practice, with things like sound editing, you'll be integrating over

258
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,500
a finite time interval, the theory of Fourier transforms is often phrased where the bounds

259
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,740
of this integral are negative infinity and infinity.

260
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,940
Concretely, what that means is that you consider this expression for all possible finite time

261
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:54,900
intervals, and you just ask, what is its limit as that time interval grows to infinity?

262
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,580
And man oh man, there's so much more to say, so much, I don't want to call it done

263
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
here.

264
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,980
This transform extends to corners of math well beyond the idea of extracting frequencies

265
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,340
from signal.

266
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,020
So the next video I put out is going to go through a couple of these, and that's where

267
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
things start getting interesting.

268
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,860
So stay subscribed for when that comes out, or an alternate option is to binge on a couple

269
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,060
3blueandbrown videos so that the YouTube recommender is more inclined to show you new things that

270
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,060
come out.

271
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,820
Really, the choice is yours.

272
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,260
And to close things off, I have something pretty fun, a mathematical puzzler from this

273
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,220
video's sponsor, Jane Street, who's looking to recruit more technical talent.

274
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:38,100
So let's say you have a closed bounded convex set C sitting in 3D space, and let B be the

275
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,220
boundary of that space, the surface of your complex blob.

276
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,260
Now imagine taking every possible pair of points on that surface and adding them up,

277
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,660
doing a vector sum.

278
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,020
Let's name this set of all possible sums D.

279
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,260
Your task is to prove that D is also a convex set.

280
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,240
So Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm, and if you're the kind of person who enjoys

281
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,420
math and solving puzzles like this, the team there really values intellectual curiosity,

282
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,460
so they might be interested in hiring you.

283
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,220
And they're looking both for full-time employees and interns.

284
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,660
For my part, I can say the couple of people I've interacted with there just seem to love

285
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,980
math and sharing math, and when they're hiring they look less at a background in finance

286
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,940
than they do at how you think, how you learn, and how you solve problems, hence the sponsorship

287
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,140
of a 3Blue1Brown video.

288
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,420
