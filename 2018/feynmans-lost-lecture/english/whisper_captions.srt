00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,580
You may be aware that I'm a huge fan of the YouTube channel 3blue1brown run by Grant

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,000
Sanderson.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,660
Grant makes excellent videos about math and mathy aspects of other topics, so I'm letting

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,960
him take over my channel for today.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,460
Grant, take it away.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,400
A week ago I put out a tweet showing a peculiar place where an ellipse rises, but what I didn't

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,580
mention is that this arbitrary seeming construction is actually highly relevant to a once-lost

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,060
lecture by Richard Feynman on why planets orbit in ellipses.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,760
The construction itself starts by drawing a circle, choosing some point within that

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,920
circle that's not at its center, what I'll call an eccentric point, and then draw a whole

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,840
bunch of lines from this eccentric point up to the circumference somewhere, and then for

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,300
each one of those lines, rotate it 90 degrees about its midpoint, and when you do that for

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,140
all of the lines, an ellipse emerges in the middle.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,480
Out of context, this is a mildly pleasing curiosity, but there's a much deeper form

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,240
of satisfaction on its way once you understand the full story surrounding this.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,620
Front and center of that story is Richard Feynman, who's famous in a number of dimensions.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,640
To scientists, he's a giant of 20th century physics, winner of the Nobel Prize for his

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,100
foundational insights in quantum electrodynamics among many other things.

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,460
To the public, he's a refreshing contradiction to the stereotypes about physicists, a safe-cracking

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,040
bongo-playing mildly philanderist nonconformist whose heavily Brooklyn-accented voice you've

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,380
probably heard either relaying some bit of no-nonsense pragmatic wisdom about the only

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,520
sensible way to view the world, or else some wry joke told through a crooked smile.

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,640
But to physics students, he was an exceptionally skillful teacher, both for his charisma and

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,940
his uncanny ability to make complicated topics feel natural and approachable.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,280
Many of the lectures he gave to a Caltech freshman course are immortalized in the now

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,100
famous Feynman lectures, his three volumes you can find for free online.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,940
But not all of the lectures he gave made it into this collection.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,000
One in particular, a guest lecture given on March 13th, 1964 entitled The Motion of Planets

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,780
Around the Sun, survived only as an unpublished partial transcript with a smattering of notes

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,420
buried in the office of one of Feynman's colleagues until it was eventually dug up

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,520
by Caltech archivist Judith Goodstein.

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,720
Despite the absence of some crucial blackboard drawings to follow what Feynman was actually

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,560
saying, her husband David eventually reconstructed the argument of the lecture, which the two

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,900
of them published in a book titled Feynman's Lost Lecture, conveying both the lecture itself

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,500
and the surrounding story in a really beautiful way.

36
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,940
Here I'd like to give a more animated and more simplified retelling of the argument

37
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,120
that Feynman was presenting.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,940
The lecture itself is about why planets, and other astronomical objects, orbit the sun

39
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,980
in ellipses.

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,260
It ultimately has to do with the inverse square law, the fact that the gravitational force

41
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,960
pulling an object towards the sun is inversely proportional to the square of the distance

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,760
between that object and the sun.

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,220
But why?

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,280
How exactly does that law give rise to an ellipse of all shapes?

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,140
Of course the gravitational attractions between different planets and moons and comets and

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,000
all of that means that no orbit is a perfect ellipse, but come on, to a very good approximation

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,460
this is the shape of an orbit.

48
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,040
You could solve this analytically, setting up the appropriate differential equation and

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
seeing the formula for an ellipse pop out.

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,260
But Feynman's goal with this lecture was to do something special, and not rely on any

51
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,580
heavy mathematical machinery.

52
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,720
In fact, let's listen to him articulate his own goal.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,760
I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration.

54
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,420
By elementary does not mean easy to understand.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Elementary means that nothing, very little, is required to know ahead of time in order

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,220
to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,680
There may be a large number of steps that are very hard to follow, but each step does

58
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,100
not require already knowing calculus, already knowing Fourier transforms, and so on.

59
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,040
Yeah, that's all, just a little infinite intelligence.

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,740
I think you're up to that, don't you?

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,040
I've done what I can to simplify things down further from his original lecture, but

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,780
that's not to say that a good deal of focus won't still be required.

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,320
First things first, we need some definition of an ellipse, otherwise there's just no

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,040
hope of proving that's the shape of an orbit.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,640
Some of you might be familiar with the classic way of constructing an ellipse using two thumbtacks

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,580
and a piece of string.

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,120
Use the thumbtacks to fix the ends of a small string in place, and then pull that string

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,660
taut with a pencil, and try to trace out a curve while keeping that string taut.

69
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,180
It's similar to how you might use a single thumbtack to construct a circle, where the

70
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,860
fixed length of the string guarantees that every point you trace out is a constant distance

71
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,800
from the thumbtack.

72
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,220
But in this case, with two thumbtacks, what property are you guaranteeing about each point

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,180
that you trace out?

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,860
Well, at every point, the sum of the distances from that point to each of the two thumbtacks

75
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,340
will be the full length of the string, right?

76
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,060
So the defining property of this curve is that when you draw lines from any point on

77
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,140
the curve to these two special thumbtack locations, the sum of the lengths of those lines is a

78
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,040
constant, namely the length of the string.

79
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,000
Each of these points is called a focus of your ellipse, collectively called foci.

80
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,140
And fun fact, the word focus comes from the Latin for fireplace, since one of the first

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,560
places where ellipses were studied was for orbits around the sun, a sort of fireplace

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,000
of the solar system, sitting at one of the foci for a planet's orbit.

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,580
Making up a little bit of terminology for ourselves, let's call this constant sum

84
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,120
of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci the focal sum of that ellipse.

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,840
We'll get to the orbital mechanics in just a moment, but first I want you to turn back

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,140
to that construction I showed at the beginning, which will come up again later in the story.

87
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,280
Remember, we take all of these lines from an eccentric point of the circle to its circumference,

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,320
and rotate each of them 90 degrees about its center.

89
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,980
But what on earth does this have to do with the constant focal sum property I just described?

90
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,600
You could just take my word for it that this emergent shape is an ellipse, but I think

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,340
you'll be much more satisfied in the end if we take a little time right now for a brief

92
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,360
side-step into geometry-proof land.

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,220
First off, there are really only two special points in this diagram.

94
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,480
There's the eccentric point from which all the lines emerge, and the center of the circle.

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,600
So a reasonable guess would be that each of these is a focus of the ellipse.

96
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,660
Given the defining property of an ellipse, you know that you're going to want to look

97
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,700
at the sum of the distances from these two points to, well, something.

98
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,220
Also, if you're doing any geometry problem involving a circle, you'll very likely want

99
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,260
to draw a radius of that circle at some point, and to use the fact that this radius has a

100
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,460
constant length no matter where you draw it.

101
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,420
I mean, that's what defines a circle, so you're probably going to need to incorporate that

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,180
fact somewhere.

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,860
With those two thoughts in the back of your mind, let's limit our attention to just one

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,900
of these lines, touching some point P on the circle.

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,100
Remember what happens in our construction.

106
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,160
You rotate this line from the eccentric point 90 degrees about its center, and the geometry

107
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,000
enthusiasts in the room might fancifully call this a perpendicular bisector of the original

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,640
line.

109
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,940
Now take a moment to think about the sum of the distances from our proposed focus points

110
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,140
to any point Q along this perpendicular bisector.

111
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,720
The key insight here is that you can find two congruent triangles and use them to conclude

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,820
that the distance from Q to the eccentric point is the same as the distance from Q to

113
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,120
P.

114
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,960
So, that means that adding the distances to each focus is the same as adding the distance

115
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,280
from the center to Q, then Q to P.

116
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,800
And there are two key things that I want you to notice here.

117
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,900
First, at the point where this perpendicular bisector intersects the radius, that sum is

118
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
clearly just the radius of the circle.

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,800
And since that radius is constant no matter where we draw it, the focal sum at that intersection

120
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,800
point stays constant, which by definition means that it traces out an ellipse, specifically

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,620
an ellipse whose focal sum is equal to the radius of the circle.

122
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Isn't that neat?

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,780
Second, because the sum of these two lengths at every other point on that perpendicular

124
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,460
bisector is larger than the radius, meaning the sum of the distances to the foci from

125
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,540
those points is bigger than the ellipse's focal sum, all other points of this line have

126
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,300
to lie outside the ellipse.

127
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,980
What that means, and this is going to be important, is that this perpendicular bisector, the line

128
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,800
we got after our special 90 degree rotation, is tangent to the ellipse.

129
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,440
So the reason that all of the lines we drew earlier make this ellipse appear from nothingness

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,760
is because we're basically drawing a whole bunch of the tangent lines to that ellipse.

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,520
The reason that's going to be important, as you'll see later, is that this tangency

132
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,500
direction is going to correspond to the velocity of an orbiting object.

133
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,520
Okay, geometry proofing is done, on to some actual physics and orbital mechanics.

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,400
The first fact is to use Kepler's very beautiful second law, which says that as an object orbits

135
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,640
around the sun, the area it sweeps out during a given amount of time, like one day, is going

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,900
to be constant, no matter where you are in the orbit.

137
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,040
For example, maybe you think about a comet whose orbit is really skewed.

138
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,260
Close to the sun, it's getting whipped around really quickly, so it covers a larger arc

139
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,920
length during a given time interval.

140
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,420
But farther away, it's moving slower, so it covers a shorter arc length during that

141
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,280
same time.

142
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,520
And this tradeoff between the radius and the arc length balances out in just such a way

143
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,880
that the swept out area is the same.

144
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,000
A quick way to see why this is true is to leverage conservation of angular momentum.

145
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,760
For any tiny little time step, delta t, the area swept out is basically a triangle, right?

146
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,000
In principle you should think of this as a very small sliver for a tiny time step, but

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm going to draw it nice and thick so we can better see all of its parts.

148
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,480
The area of this triangle is 1 half base times height, right?

149
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,940
That base is the distance to the sun.

150
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,340
And what about the height, this little length here, how do you find that?

151
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,680
Well, it's going to be the component of the object's velocity perpendicular to the

152
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,560
line of the sun, what I'll call vperp, multiplied by the small duration of time.

153
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,260
So the full area is 1 half times the radius times vperp times delta t.

154
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,240
Conservation of angular momentum with respect to a given origin point, like this sun, tells

155
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,740
us that this radius times the component of velocity perpendicular to it remains constant,

156
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,680
so long as all the forces acting on the object are directed towards that origin.

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,700
Well, specifically it says that this quantity times the mass of the object stays constant,

158
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,600
but the mass of the orbiting object isn't going to be changing.

159
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,860
So our expression for the area swept out depends only on the amount of time that has passed,

160
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,760
delta t.

161
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,100
Historically, by the way, this went the other way around.

162
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,680
Kepler's second law is one of those empirical facts that led us to an understanding of angular

163
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,160
momentum.

164
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,740
And I should emphasize, this law does not assume that orbits are ellipses.

165
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,500
Heck, it doesn't even assume the inverse square law.

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,980
The only thing needed for this equal area property to hold is that the only force acting

167
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,680
on an object is directed straight towards the sun.

168
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,740
This is a fact that Feynman spent a lot more time showing, recounting an argument by Newton

169
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,800
from his Principia.

170
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,400
But it kind of distracts from our main target, so I figure assuming conservation of angular

171
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,260
momentum is good enough for our purposes here, albeit at some loss of elementarity.

172
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,080
At this point, despite my suggestive drawings, we don't know the shape of an orbit.

173
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,200
For all we know, it's some wonky non-elliptical egg shape.

174
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,440
The inverse square law is going to help us pin down that shape precisely, but the strategy

175
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
is a little indirect.

176
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,280
Before showing the shape of the path traced out by the orbiting object, we're going

177
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,520
to show the shape traced out by the velocity vectors of that object.

178
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,900
Here, let me show you what I mean by that.

179
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,400
As the object orbits, its velocity will be changing, rotating always tangent to the curve

180
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,720
of the orbit, longer at points where the object is moving quickly, and shorter at points where

181
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,860
it's moving more slowly.

182
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,360
What we'll show is that if you take all these velocity vectors and collect them together

183
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,380
so that their tails sit at a single point, their tips actually trace out a perfect circle.

184
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,500
This is an awesome fact, if you ask me.

185
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,260
The velocity spins around, getting faster and slower at various angles, but evidently

186
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,240
the laws of physics cook things up just right so that these trace out a perfect circle.

187
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,380
The astute among you might have a little internal lightbulb starting to turn on at the site

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,400
of this circle with an off-center point.

189
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,480
But again we have to ask, why on earth should this be true?

190
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,700
Feynman describes being unable to easily follow Newton at this point, so instead he comes

191
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,640
up with his own elegant line of reasoning to explain where this circle comes from.

192
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,980
He starts by looking at the orbit, and slicing it into little pieces which all cover the

193
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,040
same angle with respect to the sun.

194
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,020
Think about the amount of time it takes for the orbiting object to traverse one of these

195
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,040
equal angle slices, and how that time changes as you go to a bigger slice.

196
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,840
By Kepler's second law, that time is proportional to the area of the slice, right?

197
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,280
And because these slices have the same angle, as you get farther away from the sun, not

198
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,380
only does the radius increase, but the component of arc length perpendicular to that radial

199
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,700
line goes up in proportion to the radius.

200
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,860
So the area of one of these slices, and hence the time it takes the object to traverse it,

201
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,320
is proportional to the distance away from the sun squared.

202
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,240
In principle, by the way, we're only going to be considering very small slices, so there

203
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,600
will be no ambiguity in what I mean by the radius, and the arc length will be a straight

204
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,040
line.

205
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Alright, now think about how the inverse square law comes into play.

206
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,400
At any given point, the force that the sun imparts on the object is proportional to 1

207
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,780
divided by the radius squared.

208
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,700
But what does that really mean?

209
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,400
What force is, is the mass of an object times its acceleration, the amount that its velocity

210
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,160
changes per unit time.

211
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,120
This is enough to give us a super useful bit of information about how the velocity of the

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,960
orbiting object changes as it goes from the start of one slice to the start of the next.

213
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,160
That change in velocity is the acceleration times the change in time, right?

214
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,240
What that means is that this change to the velocity is proportional to the change in

215
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,580
time divided by the radius squared.

216
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,520
But since the time that it takes to traverse one slice is proportional to the radius squared,

217
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,160
these terms cancel out.

218
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,920
So the change in velocity as it traverses a given slice is actually some constant that

219
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,700
doesn't depend on the slice at all.

220
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Here, unpacking what I mean by that, if you look at the velocity at the start of a slice,

221
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,460
and then you look at the velocity at the end of that slice, and directly compare those

222
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,200
two vectors by joining their tails, and you look at the difference between them, the little

223
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,340
vector joining their tips, this difference has the same length no matter which slice

224
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,980
of the orbit you were looking at.

225
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,600
So as you compare these velocity vectors at the start of each slice, they'll be forming

226
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,980
some kind of polygon whose side lengths are all the same.

227
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,160
Also, since the force vector is always pointing towards the sun, as you go from the start

228
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,280
of one slice to the next, that force vector, and hence the acceleration vector, is turning

229
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,580
by a constant angle.

230
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,260
In geometry lingo, what this implies is that all the external angles of our polygon are

231
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,580
going to be equal to each other.

232
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,900
I know this is a little tricky, but hang in there, remember, all you need to follow along

233
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,220
is infinite intelligence.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,640
It's worth reiterating just to make sure it's clear what's happening with this velocity

235
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,160
diagram.

236
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,360
The change from one vector to the next, this little difference vector joining the tip of

237
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,760
one to the tip of the next, always has the same length, that was the consequence of the

238
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,560
perfect cancellation between mixing Kepler's second law with the inverse square law.

239
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,500
And because those constant length change vectors rotate by a constant angle each time,

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
it means they form a regular polygon.

241
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,420
And as we consider finer and finer slices of the original orbit, based on smaller and

242
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,720
smaller angles for those slices, the relevant regular polygon defining the tips of these

243
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,340
vectors in the velocity diagram approaches a perfect circle.

244
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,620
Isn't that neat?

245
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Hopefully, at this point, you're looking at the circle, the eccentric point, and you're

246
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,480
itching to see how this gives rise to an ellipse the way we saw earlier.

247
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,100
But it's a little weird, right?

248
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,100
We're looking at this diagram in velocity space, so how do we use that to make conclusions

249
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,380
about the actual orbit?

250
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,520
What follows is tricky, but clever.

251
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,100
Step back and consider what we know.

252
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,300
We don't know the specific shape of the orbit, only the shape that the velocity vectors

253
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,760
trace.

254
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,660
But more specifically than that, we know that once the planet has turned an angle theta

255
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,220
degrees off the horizontal with respect to the sun, that corresponds to walking theta

256
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,700
degrees around our circle in the velocity diagram, since the acceleration vectors rotate

257
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,600
just as much as the radius vectors.

258
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,800
This tells us the tangency direction for each point of the orbit.

259
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,450
Whichever vector from that velocity diagram touches the point theta degrees around the

260
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,990
That's the velocity vector of our orbiting object, and hence the tangency direction of

261
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,430
the curve.

262
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,990
In fact, let me just start drawing all these vectors as lines, since all we're going

263
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,830
to need to use is the information they carry about the slope of the orbit curve.

264
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,410
The specific magnitude of each velocity will not be as important.

265
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,370
Notice, what I'm not saying is that the angle of the velocity vector at this point

266
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,690
is theta degrees off the vertical.

267
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:22,070
No, no, no, the angle I'm referencing in the velocity diagram is with respect to the

268
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,450
circle's center, which is almost certainly a little different from where the velocity

269
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,570
vectors are all rooted.

270
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:34,310
So the question is, what special curve satisfies the property that the tangency direction,

271
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:41,150
the slope, for a point theta radians off the horizontal is given by this vector from a

272
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,510
special eccentric point of the circle to a point theta degrees around that circle from

273
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,050
the vertical?

274
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,310
Okay, is the question clear?

275
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,170
Well, here's the trick.

276
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:58,610
First, rotate the whole circle set up 90 degrees, and then take each of those individual velocity

277
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,550
directions and rotate them 90 degrees back the other way, that way they're oriented

278
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,030
just like they were before, it's just that they're rooted in a different spot.

279
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,210
Aha!

280
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,970
We've spotted our ellipse!

281
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,510
But we still have a little bit of thinking ahead of us to really understand how this

282
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,210
little emergent ellipse is related to the astronomical orbit.

283
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,410
Importantly, I didn't just rotate these lines about any point, I rotated each one

284
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:28,270
of them about its center, which means we can leverage the geometric proof we saw a few

285
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,210
minutes ago.

286
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,330
And this is probably the moment where you have to kind of furrow your brow and think

287
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,370
back, okay, wait a minute, what was going on in that proof again?

288
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,730
Well, one of the key points was that when you have two lines, one from the center of

289
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,450
the circle and one from the eccentric point, both to a common point on the circle's circumference,

290
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,970
the perpendicular bisector to the eccentric line is tangent to the ellipse.

291
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:00,370
And what's more, the point of tangency is where that perpendicular bisector intersects

292
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,350
the radial line from the center.

293
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,790
What that means is that the point of our little ellipse, which is theta degrees off the horizontal

294
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,770
circle with respect to the circle's center, has a tangent slope perpendicular to the eccentric

295
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:19,330
line, and because of the whole 90 degree rotation thing, this means that it's parallel to the

296
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,170
velocity vector that we need it to be.

297
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,770
So this little emergent curve inside the velocity diagram has exactly the tangency property

298
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,270
that we need the orbit to have, and hence the shape of the orbit must be an ellipse,

299
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:32,910
QED.

300
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,050
OK, pat yourself on the back, because there is no small amount of cleverness required

301
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,830
to follow this.

302
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,270
First, there is this peculiar way of constructing an ellipse, which requires some geometry savviness

303
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,790
to properly prove, and then there's the pretty clever step of even thinking to ask the question

304
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,310
about what shape the velocity vectors trace out when you move their tails to the same

305
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,730
spot.

306
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,850
And showing that this is a circle requires mixing together the inverse square law with

307
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,050
Kepler's second law in another sly move.

308
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,030
But the cleverness doesn't end there.

309
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,670
Showing how this velocity diagram with vectors rooted at an off-center point implies an elliptical

310
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,050
orbit brings in this very neat 90 degree rotation trick.

311
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,370
I just love this.

312
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,050
Watching Feynman do physics, even elementary physics, is like watching Bobby Fischer play

313
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,510
chess.

314
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,150
Thanks again to Grant, and you should definitely go check out his videos on 3blue1brown.
