00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:05,745
You may be aware that I'm a huge fan of the YouTube 

2
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,000
channel 3blue1brown run by Grant Sanderson.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,696
Grant makes excellent videos about math and mathy aspects of other topics, 

4
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:13,960
so I'm letting him take over my channel for today.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,460
Grant, take it away.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,658
A week ago I put out a tweet showing a peculiar place where an ellipse rises, 

7
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:25,114
but what I didn't mention is that this arbitrary seeming construction is actually 

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:29,570
highly relevant to a once-lost lecture by Richard Feynman on why planets orbit in 

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,060
ellipses.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,400
The construction itself starts by drawing a circle, 

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,851
choosing some point within that circle that's not at its center, 

12
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:41,204
what I'll call an eccentric point, and then draw a whole bunch of lines from this 

13
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:45,928
eccentric point up to the circumference somewhere, and then for each one of those lines, 

14
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:50,388
rotate it 90 degrees about its midpoint, and when you do that for all of the lines, 

15
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,140
an ellipse emerges in the middle.

16
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,605
Out of context, this is a mildly pleasing curiosity, 

17
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:59,805
but there's a much deeper form of satisfaction on its way once you understand the 

18
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,240
full story surrounding this.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,620
Front and center of that story is Richard Feynman, who's famous in a number of dimensions.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,790
To scientists, he's a giant of 20th century physics, 

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,908
winner of the Nobel Prize for his foundational insights in quantum electrodynamics 

22
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,100
among many other things.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,608
To the public, he's a refreshing contradiction to the stereotypes about physicists, 

24
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:23,098
a safe-cracking bongo-playing mildly philanderist nonconformist whose 

25
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:26,589
heavily Brooklyn-accented voice you've probably heard either relaying 

26
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:30,977
some bit of no-nonsense pragmatic wisdom about the only sensible way to view the world, 

27
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:33,520
or else some wry joke told through a crooked smile.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,547
But to physics students, he was an exceptionally skillful teacher, 

29
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:42,050
both for his charisma and his uncanny ability to make complicated topics feel natural 

30
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,940
and approachable.

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,211
Many of the lectures he gave to a Caltech freshman course are immortalized in 

32
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:51,100
the now famous Feynman lectures, his three volumes you can find for free online.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,940
But not all of the lectures he gave made it into this collection.

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,405
One in particular, a guest lecture given on March 13th, 

35
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,122
1964 entitled The Motion of Planets Around the Sun, 

36
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:05,198
survived only as an unpublished partial transcript with a smattering of notes 

37
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:09,168
buried in the office of one of Feynman's colleagues until it was eventually 

38
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,520
dug up by Caltech archivist Judith Goodstein.

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,916
Despite the absence of some crucial blackboard drawings to follow what Feynman was 

40
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:20,073
actually saying, her husband David eventually reconstructed the argument of the lecture, 

41
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,483
which the two of them published in a book titled Feynman's Lost Lecture, 

42
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:27,500
conveying both the lecture itself and the surrounding story in a really beautiful way.

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,477
Here I'd like to give a more animated and more simplified 

44
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:34,120
retelling of the argument that Feynman was presenting.

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,525
The lecture itself is about why planets, and other astronomical objects, 

46
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,980
orbit the sun in ellipses.

47
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,992
It ultimately has to do with the inverse square law, 

48
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:47,488
the fact that the gravitational force pulling an object towards the sun 

49
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:51,760
is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between that object and the sun.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,220
But why?

51
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,280
How exactly does that law give rise to an ellipse of all shapes?

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,401
Of course the gravitational attractions between different planets and 

53
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:05,002
moons and comets and all of that means that no orbit is a perfect ellipse, 

54
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:08,460
but come on, to a very good approximation this is the shape of an orbit.

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,640
You could solve this analytically, setting up the appropriate 

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,040
differential equation and seeing the formula for an ellipse pop out.

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,415
But Feynman's goal with this lecture was to do something special, 

58
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,580
and not rely on any heavy mathematical machinery.

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,720
In fact, let's listen to him articulate his own goal.

60
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,760
I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration.

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,420
By elementary does not mean easy to understand.

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,057
Elementary means that nothing, very little, is required to know ahead of time 

63
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:42,220
in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence.

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,835
There may be a large number of steps that are very hard to follow, 

65
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:51,302
but each step does not require already knowing calculus, 

66
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:54,100
already knowing Fourier transforms, and so on.

67
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,040
Yeah, that's all, just a little infinite intelligence.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,740
I think you're up to that, don't you?

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,719
I've done what I can to simplify things down further from his original lecture, 

70
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,780
but that's not to say that a good deal of focus won't still be required.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,068
First things first, we need some definition of an ellipse, 

72
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:13,040
otherwise there's just no hope of proving that's the shape of an orbit.

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,888
Some of you might be familiar with the classic way of 

74
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,579
constructing an ellipse using two thumbtacks and a piece of string.

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,826
Use the thumbtacks to fix the ends of a small string in place, 

76
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:27,284
and then pull that string taut with a pencil, and try to trace out a curve while 

77
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:28,660
keeping that string taut.

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,026
It's similar to how you might use a single thumbtack to construct a circle, 

79
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:36,127
where the fixed length of the string guarantees that every point 

80
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,800
you trace out is a constant distance from the thumbtack.

81
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,635
But in this case, with two thumbtacks, what property 

82
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:46,180
are you guaranteeing about each point that you trace out?

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,397
Well, at every point, the sum of the distances from that point to each 

84
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:55,340
of the two thumbtacks will be the full length of the string, right?

85
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,242
So the defining property of this curve is that when you draw lines from 

86
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:04,054
any point on the curve to these two special thumbtack locations, 

87
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:09,040
the sum of the lengths of those lines is a constant, namely the length of the string.

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,000
Each of these points is called a focus of your ellipse, collectively called foci.

89
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,019
And fun fact, the word focus comes from the Latin for fireplace, 

90
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:22,509
since one of the first places where ellipses were studied was for orbits around the sun, 

91
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,000
a sort of fireplace of the solar system, sitting at one of the foci for a planet's orbit.

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,650
Making up a little bit of terminology for ourselves, 

93
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,264
let's call this constant sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two 

94
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:37,120
foci the focal sum of that ellipse.

95
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,156
We'll get to the orbital mechanics in just a moment, 

96
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:44,050
but first I want you to turn back to that construction I showed at the beginning, 

97
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,140
which will come up again later in the story.

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,565
Remember, we take all of these lines from an eccentric point of the circle 

99
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:54,320
to its circumference, and rotate each of them 90 degrees about its center.

100
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,005
But what on earth does this have to do with the 

101
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:58,980
constant focal sum property I just described?

102
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,098
You could just take my word for it that this emergent shape is an ellipse, 

103
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,484
but I think you'll be much more satisfied in the end if we take a little 

104
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:09,360
time right now for a brief side-step into geometry-proof land.

105
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,220
First off, there are really only two special points in this diagram.

106
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,480
There's the eccentric point from which all the lines emerge, and the center of the circle.

107
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,600
So a reasonable guess would be that each of these is a focus of the ellipse.

108
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,760
Given the defining property of an ellipse, you know that you're going to want 

109
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,700
to look at the sum of the distances from these two points to, well, something.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,837
Also, if you're doing any geometry problem involving a circle, 

111
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:38,712
you'll very likely want to draw a radius of that circle at some point, 

112
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:43,460
and to use the fact that this radius has a constant length no matter where you draw it.

113
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,109
I mean, that's what defines a circle, so you're probably 

114
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:48,180
going to need to incorporate that fact somewhere.

115
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,412
With those two thoughts in the back of your mind, 

116
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:55,900
let's limit our attention to just one of these lines, touching some point P on the circle.

117
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,100
Remember what happens in our construction.

118
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,884
You rotate this line from the eccentric point 90 degrees about its center, 

119
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:06,617
and the geometry enthusiasts in the room might fancifully call 

120
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,640
this a perpendicular bisector of the original line.

121
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,653
Now take a moment to think about the sum of the distances from our 

122
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:19,140
proposed focus points to any point Q along this perpendicular bisector.

123
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:27,942
The key insight here is that you can find two congruent triangles and use them to 

124
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:33,674
conclude that the distance from Q to the eccentric point is the same as the distance from 

125
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:34,120
Q to P.

126
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,299
So, that means that adding the distances to each focus is the 

127
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:43,280
same as adding the distance from the center to Q, then Q to P.

128
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,800
And there are two key things that I want you to notice here.

129
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,461
First, at the point where this perpendicular bisector intersects the radius, 

130
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:55,800
that sum is clearly just the radius of the circle.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,280
And since that radius is constant no matter where we draw it, 

132
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,664
the focal sum at that intersection point stays constant, 

133
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:07,048
which by definition means that it traces out an ellipse, 

134
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:11,620
specifically an ellipse whose focal sum is equal to the radius of the circle.

135
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Isn't that neat?

136
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,477
Second, because the sum of these two lengths at every other point on that 

137
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,692
perpendicular bisector is larger than the radius, 

138
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:26,385
meaning the sum of the distances to the foci from those points is bigger 

139
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:31,014
than the ellipse's focal sum, all other points of this line have to lie 

140
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:32,299
outside the ellipse.

141
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,132
What that means, and this is going to be important, is that this perpendicular bisector, 

142
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:42,799
the line we got after our special 90 degree rotation, is tangent to the ellipse.

143
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,783
So the reason that all of the lines we drew earlier make this ellipse appear from 

144
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:52,353
nothingness is because we're basically drawing a whole bunch of the tangent lines to that 

145
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:52,760
ellipse.

146
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,483
The reason that's going to be important, as you'll see later, 

147
00:08:56,483 --> 00:09:00,637
is that this tangency direction is going to correspond to the velocity of an 

148
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:01,500
orbiting object.

149
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,520
Okay, geometry proofing is done, on to some actual physics and orbital mechanics.

150
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:10,979
The first fact is to use Kepler's very beautiful second law, 

151
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:14,099
which says that as an object orbits around the sun, 

152
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:18,180
the area it sweeps out during a given amount of time, like one day, 

153
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,900
is going to be constant, no matter where you are in the orbit.

154
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,040
For example, maybe you think about a comet whose orbit is really skewed.

155
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,220
Close to the sun, it's getting whipped around really quickly, 

156
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,920
so it covers a larger arc length during a given time interval.

157
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,535
But farther away, it's moving slower, so it covers 

158
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:38,280
a shorter arc length during that same time.

159
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,140
And this tradeoff between the radius and the arc length balances 

160
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,880
out in just such a way that the swept out area is the same.

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,000
A quick way to see why this is true is to leverage conservation of angular momentum.

162
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,760
For any tiny little time step, delta t, the area swept out is basically a triangle, right?

163
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,737
In principle you should think of this as a very small sliver for a tiny time step, 

164
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:06,080
but I'm going to draw it nice and thick so we can better see all of its parts.

165
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,480
The area of this triangle is 1 half base times height, right?

166
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,940
That base is the distance to the sun.

167
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,340
And what about the height, this little length here, how do you find that?

168
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,757
Well, it's going to be the component of the object's velocity perpendicular to 

169
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:26,560
the line of the sun, what I'll call vperp, multiplied by the small duration of time.

170
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,260
So the full area is 1 half times the radius times vperp times delta t.

171
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,764
Conservation of angular momentum with respect to a given origin point, like this sun, 

172
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:43,609
tells us that this radius times the component of velocity perpendicular to it remains 

173
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:48,680
constant, so long as all the forces acting on the object are directed towards that origin.

174
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,050
Well, specifically it says that this quantity times the mass of the object 

175
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,600
stays constant, but the mass of the orbiting object isn't going to be changing.

176
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,104
So our expression for the area swept out depends 

177
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:04,760
only on the amount of time that has passed, delta t.

178
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,100
Historically, by the way, this went the other way around.

179
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,790
Kepler's second law is one of those empirical facts 

180
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,160
that led us to an understanding of angular momentum.

181
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,740
And I should emphasize, this law does not assume that orbits are ellipses.

182
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,500
Heck, it doesn't even assume the inverse square law.

183
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,442
The only thing needed for this equal area property to hold is that 

184
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:28,680
the only force acting on an object is directed straight towards the sun.

185
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,335
This is a fact that Feynman spent a lot more time showing, 

186
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,800
recounting an argument by Newton from his Principia.

187
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,750
But it kind of distracts from our main target, 

188
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,124
so I figure assuming conservation of angular momentum is good enough for our purposes 

189
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,260
here, albeit at some loss of elementarity.

190
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,080
At this point, despite my suggestive drawings, we don't know the shape of an orbit.

191
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,200
For all we know, it's some wonky non-elliptical egg shape.

192
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,580
The inverse square law is going to help us pin down that shape precisely, 

193
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,480
but the strategy is a little indirect.

194
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,056
Before showing the shape of the path traced out by the orbiting object, 

195
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:11,520
we're going to show the shape traced out by the velocity vectors of that object.

196
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,900
Here, let me show you what I mean by that.

197
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,529
As the object orbits, its velocity will be changing, 

198
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,580
rotating always tangent to the curve of the orbit, 

199
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,749
longer at points where the object is moving quickly, 

200
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:26,860
and shorter at points where it's moving more slowly.

201
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,969
What we'll show is that if you take all these velocity vectors and collect them together 

202
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:38,380
so that their tails sit at a single point, their tips actually trace out a perfect circle.

203
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,500
This is an awesome fact, if you ask me.

204
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,798
The velocity spins around, getting faster and slower at various angles, 

205
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:50,431
but evidently the laws of physics cook things up just right so that these trace out a 

206
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:51,240
perfect circle.

207
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,383
The astute among you might have a little internal lightbulb starting 

208
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,400
to turn on at the site of this circle with an off-center point.

209
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,480
But again we have to ask, why on earth should this be true?

210
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,800
Feynman describes being unable to easily follow Newton at this point, 

211
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,786
so instead he comes up with his own elegant line of reasoning to explain where this 

212
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:11,640
circle comes from.

213
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,990
He starts by looking at the orbit, and slicing it into little 

214
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,040
pieces which all cover the same angle with respect to the sun.

215
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,609
Think about the amount of time it takes for the orbiting object to traverse one 

216
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:30,040
of these equal angle slices, and how that time changes as you go to a bigger slice.

217
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,840
By Kepler's second law, that time is proportional to the area of the slice, right?

218
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,343
And because these slices have the same angle, as you get farther away from the sun, 

219
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:45,430
not only does the radius increase, but the component of arc length 

220
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,700
perpendicular to that radial line goes up in proportion to the radius.

221
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,979
So the area of one of these slices, and hence the time it takes the object 

222
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:59,320
to traverse it, is proportional to the distance away from the sun squared.

223
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,512
In principle, by the way, we're only going to be considering very small slices, 

224
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,732
so there will be no ambiguity in what I mean by the radius, 

225
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,040
and the arc length will be a straight line.

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Alright, now think about how the inverse square law comes into play.

227
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,290
At any given point, the force that the sun imparts on the 

228
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,780
object is proportional to 1 divided by the radius squared.

229
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,700
But what does that really mean?

230
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,709
What force is, is the mass of an object times its acceleration, 

231
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,160
the amount that its velocity changes per unit time.

232
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,907
This is enough to give us a super useful bit of information about how the velocity of the 

233
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:42,960
orbiting object changes as it goes from the start of one slice to the start of the next.

234
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,160
That change in velocity is the acceleration times the change in time, right?

235
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,994
What that means is that this change to the velocity is 

236
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:55,580
proportional to the change in time divided by the radius squared.

237
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,791
But since the time that it takes to traverse one slice is 

238
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,160
proportional to the radius squared, these terms cancel out.

239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,085
So the change in velocity as it traverses a given slice is 

240
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:10,700
actually some constant that doesn't depend on the slice at all.

241
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,109
Here, unpacking what I mean by that, if you look at the velocity at the start of a slice, 

242
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:19,315
and then you look at the velocity at the end of that slice, 

243
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:22,682
and directly compare those two vectors by joining their tails, 

244
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:27,117
and you look at the difference between them, the little vector joining their tips, 

245
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:31,125
this difference has the same length no matter which slice of the orbit you 

246
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:31,980
were looking at.

247
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,640
So as you compare these velocity vectors at the start of each slice, 

248
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,980
they'll be forming some kind of polygon whose side lengths are all the same.

249
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,663
Also, since the force vector is always pointing towards the sun, 

250
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,738
as you go from the start of one slice to the next, that force vector, 

251
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:53,580
and hence the acceleration vector, is turning by a constant angle.

252
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,993
In geometry lingo, what this implies is that all the external 

253
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:01,580
angles of our polygon are going to be equal to each other.

254
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,120
I know this is a little tricky, but hang in there, remember, 

255
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,220
all you need to follow along is infinite intelligence.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,993
It's worth reiterating just to make sure it's 

257
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,160
clear what's happening with this velocity diagram.

258
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,937
The change from one vector to the next, this little difference vector joining the tip 

259
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,844
of one to the tip of the next, always has the same length, 

260
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:26,180
that was the consequence of the perfect cancellation between mixing Kepler's second law 

261
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,560
with the inverse square law.

262
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,706
And because those constant length change vectors rotate by a constant angle each time, 

263
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:36,320
it means they form a regular polygon.

264
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,848
And as we consider finer and finer slices of the original orbit, 

265
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,863
based on smaller and smaller angles for those slices, 

266
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:48,330
the relevant regular polygon defining the tips of these vectors in the velocity 

267
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,340
diagram approaches a perfect circle.

268
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,620
Isn't that neat?

269
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,184
Hopefully, at this point, you're looking at the circle, the eccentric point, 

270
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:01,480
and you're itching to see how this gives rise to an ellipse the way we saw earlier.

271
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,099
But it's a little weird, right?

272
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,799
We're looking at this diagram in velocity space, 

273
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,380
so how do we use that to make conclusions about the actual orbit?

274
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,520
What follows is tricky, but clever.

275
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,099
Step back and consider what we know.

276
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,670
We don't know the specific shape of the orbit, 

277
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,760
only the shape that the velocity vectors trace.

278
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,375
But more specifically than that, we know that once the planet has turned 

279
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,611
an angle theta degrees off the horizontal with respect to the sun, 

280
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:34,984
that corresponds to walking theta degrees around our circle in the velocity diagram, 

281
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:39,600
since the acceleration vectors rotate just as much as the radius vectors.

282
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,800
This tells us the tangency direction for each point of the orbit.

283
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,116
Whichever vector from that velocity diagram touches the point 

284
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:52,672
theta degrees around the That's the velocity vector of our orbiting object, 

285
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,430
and hence the tangency direction of the curve.

286
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,649
In fact, let me just start drawing all these vectors as lines, 

287
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:03,865
since all we're going to need to use is the information they carry about the slope 

288
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:04,830
of the orbit curve.

289
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,410
The specific magnitude of each velocity will not be as important.

290
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,267
Notice, what I'm not saying is that the angle of the velocity 

291
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:16,690
vector at this point is theta degrees off the vertical.

292
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,335
No, no, no, the angle I'm referencing in the velocity diagram is 

293
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:23,868
with respect to the circle's center, which is almost certainly 

294
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:27,570
a little different from where the velocity vectors are all rooted.

295
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,902
So the question is, what special curve satisfies the property that 

296
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:37,528
the tangency direction, the slope, for a point theta radians off the 

297
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:42,155
horizontal is given by this vector from a special eccentric point of 

298
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:47,050
the circle to a point theta degrees around that circle from the vertical?

299
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,310
Okay, is the question clear?

300
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,170
Well, here's the trick.

301
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,801
First, rotate the whole circle set up 90 degrees, 

302
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:59,809
and then take each of those individual velocity directions and rotate them 90 degrees 

303
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,118
back the other way, that way they're oriented just like they were before, 

304
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:07,030
it's just that they're rooted in a different spot.

305
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,210
Aha!

306
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,970
We've spotted our ellipse!

307
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,393
But we still have a little bit of thinking ahead of us to really understand 

308
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:18,210
how this little emergent ellipse is related to the astronomical orbit.

309
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,716
Importantly, I didn't just rotate these lines about any point, 

310
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:26,018
I rotated each one of them about its center, which means we 

311
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:29,210
can leverage the geometric proof we saw a few minutes ago.

312
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,170
And this is probably the moment where you have to kind of furrow your brow 

313
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,370
and think back, okay, wait a minute, what was going on in that proof again?

314
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,069
Well, one of the key points was that when you have two lines, 

315
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:45,522
one from the center of the circle and one from the eccentric point, 

316
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:49,058
both to a common point on the circle's circumference, 

317
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:53,970
the perpendicular bisector to the eccentric line is tangent to the ellipse.

318
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,935
And what's more, the point of tangency is where that 

319
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:02,350
perpendicular bisector intersects the radial line from the center.

320
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,383
What that means is that the point of our little ellipse, 

321
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:11,110
which is theta degrees off the horizontal circle with respect to the circle's center, 

322
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,243
has a tangent slope perpendicular to the eccentric line, 

323
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:17,047
and because of the whole 90 degree rotation thing, 

324
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:21,170
this means that it's parallel to the velocity vector that we need it to be.

325
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,312
So this little emergent curve inside the velocity diagram 

326
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:29,389
has exactly the tangency property that we need the orbit to have, 

327
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,910
and hence the shape of the orbit must be an ellipse, QED.

328
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,780
OK, pat yourself on the back, because there is no 

329
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,830
small amount of cleverness required to follow this.

330
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,676
First, there is this peculiar way of constructing an ellipse, 

331
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:48,770
which requires some geometry savviness to properly prove, 

332
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,396
and then there's the pretty clever step of even thinking to ask the 

333
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:56,183
question about what shape the velocity vectors trace out when you move 

334
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:57,730
their tails to the same spot.

335
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,643
And showing that this is a circle requires mixing together the 

336
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:05,050
inverse square law with Kepler's second law in another sly move.

337
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,030
But the cleverness doesn't end there.

338
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,712
Showing how this velocity diagram with vectors rooted at an off-center point 

339
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:16,050
implies an elliptical orbit brings in this very neat 90 degree rotation trick.

340
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,370
I just love this.

341
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,488
Watching Feynman do physics, even elementary physics, 

342
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,510
is like watching Bobby Fischer play chess.

343
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:27,090
