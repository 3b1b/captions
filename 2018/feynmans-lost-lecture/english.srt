00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
You may be aware that I'm a huge fan of the YouTube channel 3blue1brown run by Grant

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,740
Sanderson.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,640
Grant makes excellent videos about math and mathy aspects of other topics, so I'm letting

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,320
him take over my channel for today.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,440
Grant, take it away.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,400
A week ago I put out a tweet showing a peculiar place where an ellipse rises, but what I didn't

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,560
mention is that this arbitrary seeming construction is actually highly relevant to a once-lost

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,760
lecture by Richard Feynman on why planets orbit in ellipses.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,660
The construction itself starts by drawing a circle, choosing some point within that

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,840
circle that's not at its center, what I'll call an eccentric point, and then draw a whole

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,760
bunch of lines from this eccentric point up to the circumference somewhere, and then for

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,200
each one of those lines, rotate it 90 degrees about its midpoint, and when you do that for

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
all of the lines, an ellipse emerges in the middle.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,440
Out of context this is a mildly pleasing curiosity, but there's a much deeper form

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,880
of satisfaction on its way once you understand the full story surrounding this.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,160
Front and center of that story is Richard Feynman, who's famous in a number of dimensions.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,520
To scientists he's a giant of 20th century physics, winner of the Nobel Prize for his

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,580
foundational insights in quantum electrodynamics among many other things.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,400
To the public he's a refreshing contradiction to the stereotypes about physicists, a safe-cracking

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,920
bongo-playing mildly philanderist nonconformist whose heavily Brooklyn-accented voice you've

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,320
probably heard either relaying some bit of no-nonsense pragmatic wisdom about the only

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,340
sensible way to view the world, or else some wry joke told through a crooked smile.

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,600
But to physics students he was an exceptionally skillful teacher, both for his charisma and

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,540
his uncanny ability to make complicated topics feel natural and approachable.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,140
Many of the lectures he gave to a Caltech freshman course are immortalized in the now

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,940
famous Feynman lectures, his three volumes you can find for free online.

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,620
But not all of the lectures he gave made it into this collection.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,940
One in particular, a guest lecture given on March 13th, 1964 entitled The Motion of Planets

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,740
Around the Sun, survived only as an unpublished partial transcript with a smattering of notes

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,460
buried in the office of one of Feynman's colleagues until it was eventually dug up

31
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,100
by Caltech archivist Judith Goodstein.

32
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,800
Despite the absence of some crucial blackboard drawings to follow what Feynman was actually

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,440
saying, her husband David eventually reconstructed the argument of the lecture, which the two

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,000
of them published in a book titled Feynman's Lost Lecture, conveying both the lecture itself

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,840
and the surrounding story in a really beautiful way.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,920
Here I'd like to give a more animated and more simplified retelling of the argument

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,540
that Feynman was presenting.

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,000
The lecture itself is about why planets, and other astronomical objects, orbit the sun

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,560
in ellipses.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,180
It ultimately has to do with the inverse square law, the fact that the gravitational force

41
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,220
pulling an object towards the sun is inversely proportional to the square of the distance

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,640
between that object and the sun.

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,900
But why?

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,060
How exactly does that law give rise to an ellipse of all shapes?

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,120
Of course the gravitational attractions between different planets and moons and comets and

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,260
all of that means that no orbit is a perfect ellipse, but come on, to a very good approximation

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,680
this is the shape of an orbit.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
You could solve this analytically, setting up the appropriate differential equation and

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
seeing the formula for an ellipse pop out.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,200
But Feynman's goal with this lecture was to do something special, and not rely on any

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,640
heavy mathematical machinery.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,600
In fact, let's listen to him articulate his own goal.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,320
I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration.

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,120
By elementary does not mean easy to understand.

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,400
Elementary means that nothing, very little, is required to know ahead of time in order

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,720
to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,640
There may be a large number of steps that are very hard to follow, but each step does

58
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,080
not require already knowing calculus, already knowing Fourier transforms and so on.

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah, that's all, just a little infinite intelligence.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,120
I think you're up to that, don't you?

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,000
I've done what I can to simplify things down further from his original lecture, but

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
that's not to say that a good deal of focus won't still be required.

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,440
First things first, we need some definition of an ellipse, otherwise there's no hope

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,800
of proving that's the shape of an orbit.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,640
Some of you might be familiar with the classic way of constructing an ellipse using two thumbtacks

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
and a piece of string.

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,120
Use the thumbtacks to fix the ends of a small string in place, and then pull that string

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,480
taut with a pencil, and try to trace out a curve while keeping that string taut.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,040
It's similar to how you might use a single thumbtack to construct a circle, where the

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,820
fixed length of the string guarantees that every point you trace out is a constant distance

71
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,560
from the thumbtack.

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,280
But in this case, with two thumbtacks, what property are you guaranteeing about each point

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,840
you trace out?

74
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,280
Well, at every point, the sum of the distances from that point to each of the two thumbtacks

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
will be the full length of the string, right?

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,080
The defining property of this curve is that when you draw lines from any point on the

77
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,840
curve to these two special thumbtack locations, the sum of the lengths of those lines is a

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,240
constant, namely the length of the string.

79
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
Each of these points is called a focus of your ellipse, collectively called foci.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
And fun fact, the word focus comes from the Latin for fireplace, since one of the first

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
places where ellipses were studied was for orbits around the sun, a sort of fireplace

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
of the solar system, sitting at one of the foci for a planet's orbit.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Making up a little bit of terminology for ourselves, let's call this constant sum

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,760
of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci, the focal sum of that ellipse.

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,760
We'll get to the orbital mechanics in just a moment, but first I want you to turn back

86
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,600
to that construction I showed at the beginning, which will come up again later in the story.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,840
Remember, we take all of these lines from an eccentric point of the circle to its circumference,

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
and rotate each of them 90 degrees about its center.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,760
But what on earth does this have to do with the constant focal sum property I just described?

90
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,600
You could just take my word for it that this emergent shape is an ellipse, but I think

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,280
you'll be much more satisfied in the end if we take a little time right now for a brief

92
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
side step into geometry-proof land.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
First off, there are really only two special points in this diagram.

94
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,120
There's the eccentric point from which all the lines emerge, and the center of the circle.

95
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,960
So a reasonable guess would be that each of these is a focus of the ellipse.

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,640
Given the defining property of an ellipse, you know that you're going to want to look

97
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,400
at the sum of the distances from these two points to, well, something.

98
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Also, if you're doing any geometry problem involving a circle, you'll very likely want

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,040
to draw a radius of that circle at some point, and to use the fact that this radius has a

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,320
constant length no matter where you draw it.

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,360
I mean, that's what defines a circle, so you're probably going to need to incorporate that

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,080
fact somewhere.

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,800
With those two thoughts in the back of your mind, let's limit our attention to just one

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,880
of these lines, touching some point P on the circle.

105
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,760
Remember what happens in our construction.

106
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,200
We rotate this line from the eccentric point 90 degrees about its center, and the geometry

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,280
enthusiasts in the room might fancifully call this a perpendicular bisector of the original

108
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
line.

109
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,340
Now take a moment to think about the sum of the distances from our proposed focus points

110
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:23,240
to any point Q along this perpendicular bisector.

111
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,700
The key insight here is that you can find two congruent triangles and use them to conclude

112
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,740
that the distance from Q to the eccentric point is the same as the distance from Q to

113
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
P.

114
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,940
So, that means that adding the distances to each focus is the same as adding the distance

115
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,180
from the center to Q, then Q to P.

116
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,420
And there are two key things that I want you to notice here.

117
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:54,180
First, at the point where this perpendicular bisector intersects the radius, that sum is

118
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,660
clearly just the radius of the circle.

119
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,820
And since that radius is constant no matter where we draw it, the focal sum at that intersection

120
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,980
point stays constant, which by definition means that it traces out an ellipse, specifically

121
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,260
an ellipse whose focal sum is equal to the radius of the circle.

122
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,020
Isn't that neat?

123
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,740
And second, because the sum of these two lengths at every other point on that perpendicular

124
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,420
bisector is larger than the radius, meaning the sum of the distances to the foci from

125
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,460
those points is bigger than the ellipse's focal sum, all other points of this line have

126
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,980
to lie outside the ellipse.

127
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,880
What that means, and this is going to be important, is that this perpendicular bisector, the line

128
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,740
that we got after our special 90 degree rotation, is tangent to the ellipse.

129
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,800
So the reason that all of the lines that we drew earlier make this ellipse appear from

130
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,040
nothingness is because we're basically drawing a whole bunch of the tangent lines to that

131
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,340
ellipse.

132
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,280
The reason that's important, as you'll see later, is that this tangency direction

133
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,180
is going to correspond to the velocity of an orbiting object.

134
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,740
Okay, geometry proofing is done, on to some actual physics and orbital mechanics.

135
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,420
The first fact is to use Kepler's very beautiful second law, which says that as an object orbits

136
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,580
around the sun, the area it sweeps out during a given amount of time, like one day, is going

137
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,760
to be constant no matter where you are in the orbit.

138
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,720
For example, maybe you think about a comet whose orbit is really skewed.

139
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,180
Close to the sun, it's getting whipped around really quickly, so it covers a larger arc

140
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,560
length during a given time interval.

141
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,360
But farther away, it's moving slower, so it covers a shorter arc length during that

142
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
same time.

143
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,780
And this tradeoff between the radius and the arc length balances out in just such a way

144
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,160
that the swept out area is the same.

145
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,120
A quick way to see why this is true is to leverage conservation of angular momentum.

146
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,340
For any tiny little time step, delta t, the area swept out is basically a triangle.

147
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,320
In principle you should think of this as a small sliver for a tiny time step, but I'm

148
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,920
going to draw it nice and thick so we can better see all of its parts.

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,040
The area of this triangle is 1 half base times height.

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,840
That base is the distance to the sun.

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,800
What about the height, this little length here, how do you find that?

152
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,000
It's going to be the component of the object's velocity perpendicular to the line of the

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,580
sun, what I'll call vperp, multiplied by the small duration of time.

154
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:34,480
So the full area is 1 half times the radius times vperp times delta t.

155
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,200
Conservation of angular momentum with respect to a given origin point, like this sun, tells

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,200
us that this radius times the component of velocity perpendicular to it remains constant,

157
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,120
so long as all the forces acting on the object are directed towards that origin.

158
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,080
Well, specifically it says that this quantity times the mass of the object stays constant,

159
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,640
but the mass of the orbiting object isn't going to be changing.

160
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,080
So our expression for the area swept out depends only on the amount of time that has passed,

161
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
delta t.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,400
Historically, by the way, this went the other way around.

163
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,640
Kepler's second law is one of those empirical facts that led us to an understanding of angular

164
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
momentum.

165
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,000
And I should emphasize, this law does not assume that orbits are ellipses.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,920
Heck, it doesn't even assume the inverse square law.

167
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,960
The only thing needed for this equal area property to hold is that the only force acting

168
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,580
on an object is directed straight towards the sun.

169
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,680
This is a fact that Feynman spent a lot more time showing, recounting an argument by Newton

170
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,420
from his Principia.

171
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,360
But it kind of distracts from our main target, so I figure assuming conservation of angular

172
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,320
momentum is good enough for our purposes here, albeit at some loss of elementarity.

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,480
At this point, despite my suggestive drawings, we don't know the shape of an orbit.

174
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,920
For all we know, it's some wonky non-elliptical egg shape.

175
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,400
The inverse square law is going to help us pin down that shape precisely, but the strategy

176
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,040
is a little indirect.

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,200
Before showing the shape of the path traced out by the orbiting object, what we're going

178
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,720
to show is the shape traced out by the velocity vectors of that object.

179
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,600
Here, let me show you what I mean by that.

180
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,440
As the object orbits, its velocity will be changing, right?

181
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,720
It's rotating, always tangent to the curve of the orbit, and it's longer at points where

182
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,660
the object is moving quickly, and shorter at points where it's moving more slowly.

183
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,440
What we'll show is that if you take all these velocity vectors and collect them together

184
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,560
so that their tails sit at a single point, their tips actually trace out a perfect circle.

185
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,000
This is an awesome fact, if you ask me.

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,560
The velocity spins around, getting faster and slower at various angles, but evidently

187
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,240
the laws of physics cook things up just right so that these trace out a perfect circle.

188
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,360
The astute among you might have a little internal lightbulb starting to turn on at the site

189
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,680
of this circle with an off-center point.

190
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,520
But again, we have to ask, why on earth should this be true?

191
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,680
Feynman describes being unable to easily follow Newton at this point, so instead he comes

192
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,120
up with his own elegant line of reasoning to explain where this circle comes from.

193
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,280
He starts by looking at the orbit, whose shape we don't know, and slicing it into little

194
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,880
pieces which all cover the same angle with respect to the sun.

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,920
Think about the amount of time it takes for the orbiting object to traverse one of these

196
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,240
equal angle slices, and how that time changes as you go to a bigger slice.

197
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,800
By Kepler's second law, that time is proportional to the area of the slice, right?

198
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,240
Because these slices have the same angle, as you get farther away from the sun, not

199
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,400
only does the radius increase, but the component of arc length perpendicular to that radial

200
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,560
line goes up in proportion to the radius.

201
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,280
The area of one of these slices, and hence the time it takes the object to traverse it,

202
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,280
is proportional to the distance away from the sun squared.

203
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,460
In principle, we're only going to be considering very small slices, so there won't be any

204
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:12,000
ambiguity in what I mean by the radius, and the arc length will be a straight line.

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,320
Think about how the inverse square law comes into play.

206
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,480
At any given point, the force that the sun imparts on the object is proportional to 1

207
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,540
divided by the radius squared.

208
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,680
But what does that really mean?

209
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,400
What force is, is the mass of an object times its acceleration, the amount that its velocity

210
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,260
changes per unit time.

211
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,040
This is enough to give us a super useful bit of information about how the velocity of the

212
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,900
orbiting object changes as it goes from the start of one slice to the start of the next.

213
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,060
That change in velocity is the acceleration times the change in time, right?

214
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,140
What that means is that this change to the velocity is proportional to the change in

215
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,660
time divided by the radius squared.

216
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,020
But since the time it takes to traverse one slice is proportional to the radius squared,

217
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,580
these terms cancel out, so the change in velocity as it traverses a given slice is actually

218
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,020
some constant that doesn't depend on the slice at all.

219
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,060
Here, unpacking what I mean by that, if you look at the velocity at the start of a slice,

220
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,420
and then you look at the velocity at the end of that slice, and directly compare those

221
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,180
two vectors by joining their tails, and you look at the difference between them, the little

222
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,300
vector joining their tips, this difference has the same length no matter which slice

223
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,860
of the orbit you were looking at.

224
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,600
So as you compare these velocity vectors at the start of each slice, they'll be forming

225
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,720
some kind of polygon whose side lengths are all the same.

226
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,160
Also, since the force vector is always pointing towards the sun, as you go from the start

227
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,300
of one slice to the next, that force vector, and hence the acceleration vector, is turning

228
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,280
by a constant angle.

229
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,240
In geometry lingo, what this implies is that all the external angles of our polygon are

230
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
going to be equal to each other.

231
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
I know that this is a little tricky, but hang in there.

232
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,240
Remember, all you need to follow along is infinite intelligence.

233
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,760
It's worth reiterating just to make sure it's clear what's happening with this velocity

234
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,800
diagram.

235
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,320
The change from one vector to the next, this little difference vector joining the tip of

236
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,660
one to the tip of the next, always has the same length.

237
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,560
That was the consequence of the perfect cancellation between mixing Kepler's second law with the

238
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,280
inverse square law.

239
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,280
And because those constant length change vectors rotate by a constant angle each time, it means

240
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,280
that they form a regular polygon.

241
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,400
And as we consider finer and finer slices of the original orbit, based on smaller and

242
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,660
smaller angles for those slices, the relevant regular polygon defining the tips of these

243
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,080
vectors in the velocity diagram approaches a perfect circle.

244
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,360
Isn't that neat?

245
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,320
Hopefully at this point you're looking at the circle, you're looking at the eccentric

246
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,080
point, and you're just itching to see how this gives rise to an ellipse the way we saw

247
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,300
earlier.

248
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
But it's a little weird, right?

249
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,120
We're looking at this diagram in velocity space, so how do we use that to make conclusions

250
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,400
about the actual orbit?

251
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,560
What follows is tricky but clever.

252
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,760
Step back and consider what we know.

253
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,440
We don't know the specific shape of the orbit, only the shape that the velocity vectors

254
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,600
trace.

255
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,540
But more specifically than that, we know that once the planet has turned an angle theta

256
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,100
degrees off the horizontal with respect to the sun, that corresponds to walking theta

257
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,800
degrees around our circle in the velocity diagram, since the acceleration vectors rotate

258
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,620
just as much as the radius vectors.

259
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,420
This tells us the tangency direction for each point of the orbit.

260
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,180
Whichever vector from that velocity diagram touches the point theta degrees around the

261
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,820
circle, that's the velocity vector of our orbiting object, and hence the tangency direction

262
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,820
of the curve.

263
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,980
In fact, let me just start drawing all these vectors as lines, since all we're going to

264
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,300
need to use is the information they carry about the slope of the orbit curve.

265
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,900
The specific magnitude of each velocity will not be as important.

266
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,620
Notice, what I'm not saying is that the angle of the velocity vector at this point

267
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,700
is theta degrees off the vertical.

268
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,780
No, no, no, the angle I'm referencing in the velocity diagram is with respect to the

269
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,740
circle's center, which is almost certainly a little different from where the velocity

270
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,420
vectors are all rooted.

271
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:34,700
So the question is, what special curve satisfies the property that the tangency direction,

272
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:41,020
the slope, for a point theta radians off the horizontal is given by this vector from a

273
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,540
special eccentric point of the circle to a point theta degrees around that circle from

274
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
the vertical?

275
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,820
Okay, is the question clear?

276
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,780
Well, here's the trick.

277
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,060
First, rotate the whole circle set up 90 degrees, and then take each of those individual

278
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,620
velocity directions and rotate them 90 degrees back the other way, that way they're oriented

279
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,660
just like they were before, it's just that they're rooted in a different spot.

280
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Aha!

281
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,440
We've spotted our ellipse!

282
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,420
But we still have a little bit of thinking ahead of us to really understand how this

283
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,700
little emergent ellipse is related to the astronomical orbit.

284
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,340
Importantly, I didn't just rotate these lines about any point, I rotated each one

285
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,180
of them about its center, which means we can leverage the geometric proof we saw a few

286
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
minutes ago.

287
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,260
And this is probably the moment where you have to furrow your brow and think back, okay

288
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,780
wait a minute, what was going on in that proof again?

289
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,620
Well, one of the key points was that when you have two lines, one from the center of

290
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:48,280
the circle and one from the eccentric point, both to a common point on the circle's circumference,

291
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,460
the perpendicular bisector to the eccentric line is tangent to the ellipse.

292
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,360
And what's more, the point of tangency is where that perpendicular bisector intersects

293
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,360
the radial line from the center.

294
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,840
What that means is that the point of our little ellipse, which is theta degrees off the horizontal

295
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,800
with respect to the circle's center, has a tangent slope perpendicular to the eccentric

296
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,980
line, and because of the whole 90 degree rotation thing, this means that it's parallel

297
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,920
to the velocity vector we need it to be.

298
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,780
So this little emergent curve inside the velocity diagram has exactly the tangency property

299
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,800
that we need the orbit to have, and hence the shape of the orbit must be an ellipse,

300
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,640
QED.

301
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,080
Okay, pat yourself on the back, because there is no small amount of cleverness required

302
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,200
to follow this.

303
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,280
First, there was this peculiar way of constructing an ellipse, which requires some geometry savviness

304
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,160
to properly prove, and then there's the pretty clever step of even thinking to ask

305
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,760
the question about what shape the velocity vectors trace out when you move their tails

306
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,560
to the same spot.

307
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,800
And showing that this is a circle requires mixing together the inverse square law with

308
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,760
Kepler's second law in another sly move.

309
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,080
But the cleverness doesn't end there, showing how this velocity diagram with vectors rooted

310
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,880
at an off-center point implies an elliptical orbit brings in this very neat 90 degree rotation

311
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
trick.

312
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,080
I just love this.

313
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,160
Watching Feynman do physics, even elementary physics, is like watching Bobby Fischer play

314
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
chess.

315
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,280
Thanks again to Grant, and you should definitely go check out his videos on 3Blue1Brown.
