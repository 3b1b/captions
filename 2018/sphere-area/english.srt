1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Some of you may have seen in school that the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r squared,

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,000
a suspiciously suggestive formula given that it's a clean multiple of the more popular

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,080
pi r squared, the area of a circle with the same radius.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,040
But have you ever wondered why this is true?

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,460
And I don't just mean proving the 4 pi r squared formula, I mean viscerally feeling

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,520
to your bones a connection between this surface area and these four circles.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,280
How lovely would it be if there were some subtle shift in perspective that shows how

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,880
you could nicely and perfectly fit these four circles onto the sphere's surface?

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,800
Nothing can be quite that simple, since the curvature of a sphere's surface is different

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,240
from the curvature of a flat plane, which is why trying to fit, say, a piece of paper

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,840
around the sphere just doesn't work.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,860
Nevertheless, I would like to show you two separate ways of thinking about the surface

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,700
area that connect it in a satisfying way to these circles.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,180
The first comes from a classic, one of the true gems of geometry that I think all math

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,060
students should experience the same way all English students should read at least some

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,240
Shakespeare.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,820
The second line of reasoning is something of my own, which draws a more direct line

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,680
between the sphere and its shadow.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,060
And lastly, I'll share why this fourfold relation is not unique to spheres, but is

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,340
instead one specific instance of a much more general fact for all convex shapes in three

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,220
dimensions.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,500
Starting with the bird's eye view here, the idea for the first approach is to show

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,300
that the surface area of the sphere is the same as the area of a cylinder with the same

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,780
radius and the same height as that sphere, or rather, a cylinder without the top and

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,620
bottom, what you might call the label of that cylinder.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,180
Once you have that, you can unwrap that label to understand it simply as a rectangle.

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,820
The width of this rectangle comes from the cylinder's circumference, so it's 2 pi

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,180
times r, and the height comes from the height of the sphere, which is 2 times the radius.

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,860
And this already gives us the formula, 4 pi r squared when we multiply the two.

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,580
But in the spirit of mathematical playfulness, it's nice to see how four circles with radius

31
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,700
r can actually fit into this picture.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,180
The idea will be to unwrap each circle into a triangle without changing its area, and

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,980
then to fit those nicely into the unfolded cylinder label.

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,820
We'll cover that in a couple minutes.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,340
The more pressing question is, why on earth should the sphere be related to the cylinder

36
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,920
in this way?

37
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,020
The way I'm animating it is already suggestive of how this might work.

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,340
The idea is to approximate the area of the sphere with many tiny rectangles covering

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,400
it, and to show how if you project these rectangles directly outward, as if casting a shadow by

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,260
little lights positioned on the z-axis, pointing parallel to the xy-plane, the projection of

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,660
each rectangle onto the cylinder, quite surprisingly, ends up having the same area as the original

42
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,820
rectangle.

43
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,060
But why should that be?

44
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,720
There are two competing effects at play here.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,400
For one of these rectangles, let's call the side along the latitude lines its width,

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,340
and the side along the longitude lines its height.

47
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:20,600
On the one hand, as the rectangle is projected outward, its width will get scaled up.

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,080
For rectangles towards the poles, that length is scaled up quite a bit, since they're

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,560
projected over a longer distance.

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,620
But for those closer to the equator, the effect might be close to nothing.

51
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,520
But on the other hand, because these rectangles are already slant with respect to the z-direction,

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,260
during this projection, the height of each rectangle will get scaled down.

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,640
Think about holding some flat object and looking at its shadow.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,600
As you reorient that object, the shadow looks more or less squished for some angles.

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,500
Take a look, those rectangles towards the poles are quite slanted this way, so their

56
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,440
height will get squished down by a lot.

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,560
For those closer to the equator, oriented somewhere closer to parallel to the z-axis,

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,840
the effect is not as much.

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,880
It will turn out that these two effects of stretching the width and squishing the height

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,680
cancel each other out perfectly.

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
If you're looking at a rough sketch, wouldn't you agree that this is a pretty way of reasoning?

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Of course, the meat here comes from showing why these two competing effects cancel each

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,580
other out.

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,840
In some ways, the details fleshing this out are just as pretty as the zoomed-out structure

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,160
of the full argument.

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
So let's dig in.

67
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,740
Let me go ahead and cut away half of the sphere so we can get a better look.

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,560
For any mathematical problem solving, it never hurts to start by giving things names.

69
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,700
So let's say the radius of the sphere is r, and for one specific rectangle, let's

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,920
call the distance between that rectangle and the z-axis d.

71
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,120
You could rightfully complain that the distance d is a little ambiguous, depending on which

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,000
point of that rectangle you're going from.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,400
But for tinier and tinier rectangles, that ambiguity will become negligible, and tinier

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,740
and tinier is when this approximation with rectangles gets closer to the true surface

75
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,560
area anyway.

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,760
To choose an arbitrary standard, let's say that d is the distance from the bottom of

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
the rectangle.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,400
To think about projecting this out to the cylinder, we're going to picture two similar

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
triangles.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,620
The first one shares its base with the base of the rectangle on the sphere, and has a

81
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,980
tip at the same height but on the z-axis, a distance d away.

82
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,860
The second triangle is a scaled-up version of this, scaled so that it just barely reaches

83
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,300
the cylinder, meaning its long side now has a length r.

84
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,880
So the ratio of their bases, which is how much our rectangle's width gets stretched

85
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,740
out, is r divided by d.

86
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,860
What about the height?

87
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,300
How precisely does that get scaled down as we project?

88
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,780
Again, let's slice a cross-section for a cleaner view.

89
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,700
In fact, why don't we go ahead and completely focus our view to this two-dimensional cross-section.

90
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,080
To think about the projection, let's make a little right triangle, like this, where

91
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,760
what was the height of our spherical rectangle is the hypotenuse, and the projection is one

92
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,340
of the legs.

93
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,640
Pro tip, any time you're doing geometry with circles or spheres, keep in the forefront

94
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,020
of your mind that anything tangent to the circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn

95
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,780
to that point of tangency.

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,060
It's crazy just how helpful that one little fact can be for making progress.

97
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,980
In our case, once we draw that radial line, together with the distance d, we have another

98
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,820
right triangle.

99
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,580
And often in geometry I like to imagine tweaking the parameters of a setup and imagining how

100
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,900
the relevant shapes change.

101
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,620
This helps to make guesses about what the relations might be.

102
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,500
In this case, you might predict that the two triangles I've drawn are similar to each

103
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,100
other, since their shapes seem to change in concert with each other.

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,980
This is indeed true, but as always, don't take my word for it, see if you can justify

105
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,420
this for yourself.

106
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,700
Again, it never hurts to give more names to things.

107
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,320
Maybe let's call this angle alpha, and this other one beta.

108
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,940
Since this is a right triangle, we know that alpha plus beta plus 90 degrees must be 180

109
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,300
degrees.

110
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,340
Now let's zoom in on our little triangle, and see if we can figure out what its angles

111
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,840
might be.

112
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,300
Notice this 90 degree angle, which comes from the radius being perpendicular to the tangent,

113
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,340
and how when it's combined with this beta here and some other little angle, it forms

114
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,880
a straight line.

115
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,440
So that other little angle must be alpha.

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,580
And this lets us fill out a few more values, which reveals that this little triangle also

117
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,080
has angles alpha, beta, and 90 degrees, so it is indeed similar to the big one.

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,040
Keep in the weeds like this, it's sometimes easy to forget why we're doing this.

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,800
Remember, what we want to know is how much the height of the sphere rectangle gets squished

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,160
down as we project it out, and that's the ratio of this little hypotenuse to the leg

121
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,560
on the right side.

122
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,800
By the similarity with the big triangle, the ratio of those two sides is again, r divided

123
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
by d.

124
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,320
So indeed, as this rectangle gets projected outward, the effect of stretching out the

125
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,040
width is perfectly cancelled out by how much that height is getting squished due to the

126
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,820
slant.

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,560
As a fun side note, you might notice that it looks like the projected rectangle is a

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,040
90 degree rotation of the original.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,280
This would not at all be true in general, but by a lovely coincidence, the way I'm

130
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,900
parameterizing the sphere results in rectangles where the ratio of the width to the height

131
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,360
starts out as d to r.

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,360
So, for this very specific case, rescaling the width by r over d, and rescaling the height

133
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,920
by d over r, actually does have the effect of a 90 degree rotation.

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,800
And this lends itself to a rather bizarre way to animate the relation, where instead

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,000
of projecting each rectangular piece as if casting a shadow, you can rotate each one

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,840
of them 90 degrees, and then rearrange them all to make the cylinder.

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,520
Now, if you're really thinking critically, you might still not be satisfied that this

138
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,020
shows us what the surface area of the sphere is, because all of these little rectangles

139
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,720
only approximate the relevant areas.

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,980
Well, the idea is that this approximation gets closer and closer to the true value for

141
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,260
finer and finer coverings.

142
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,920
And since for any specific covering, the sphere rectangles have the same area as the cylinder

143
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,280
whatever value each of these two series of approximations are approaching must actually

144
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
be the same.

145
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,080
I mean, as you get really aggressively philosophical about what we even mean by surface area, these

146
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,940
sorts of rectangular approximations are not just aids in our problem-solving toolbox,

147
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,400
they end up serving as a way to rigorously define the idea of area in the context of

148
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,200
smooth curved surfaces.

149
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
This kind of reasoning is essentially calculus, just without any of the jargon.

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,840
In fact, I think neat geometric arguments like this, which require no background in

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,880
calculus to understand, can serve as a great way to tee things up for new calculus students

152
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,360
so that they have the core ideas already in their head before seeing the definitions which

153
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
make them precise, rather than going the other way around.

154
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,800
Alright, so as I said before, if you're the kind of person who's just itching to

155
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,560
see a direct connection to these four circles, one nice way to do that is to unwrap those

156
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,660
circles into triangles.

157
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,740
If this is something you haven't seen before, I go into much more detail about why this

158
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,660
works in the first video of the calculus series.

159
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,140
The basic idea is to relate thin concentric rings of the circle with horizontal slices

160
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,940
of this triangle.

161
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,300
Because the circumference of each such ring increases linearly in proportion to the radius,

162
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,820
always 2 pi times that radius, when you unwrap them all and line them up like this, their

163
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,540
ends form a straight line as opposed to some other curved shape, which gives us a triangle

164
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,460
with base 2 pi r and height r.

165
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,380
And four of these unwrapped circles fit perfectly into our rectangle, which is in some sense

166
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,300
an unwrapped version of the sphere's surface.

167
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,260
That's pretty satisfying, but you might nevertheless be wondering if there's some

168
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,860
way to relate this sphere directly to a circle with the same radius, rather than going through

169
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,140
this intermediary of a cylinder.

170
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,380
I do have a proof for you to this effect, leveraging a little trigonometry, though I

171
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,300
have to admit I still think the comparison to the cylinder wins out on raw elegance.

172
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,220
Now I'm a big believer that the best way to really learn math is to do problems for

173
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,580
yourself, which is a bit hypocritical coming from a channel essentially consisting of lectures,

174
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,700
so I'm going to try something a little different here, and present the proof as a heavily guided

175
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,940
sequence of exercises.

176
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,500
Yes, I know that's less fun, and it means you have to pull out some paper to do a little

177
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,680
work, but I guarantee you'll get more out of it this way.

178
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,260
At a high level, the approach will be to cut the sphere into many thin rings parallel to

179
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:17,020
the xy plane, and to compare the area of these rings to the area of their shadows on the

180
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,460
xy plane.

181
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,700
All of the shadows of the rings from, say, the northern hemisphere make up a circle with

182
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,740
the same radius as the sphere, right?

183
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,840
The main idea will be to show a correspondence between these ring shadows and every second

184
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,080
ring on the sphere.

185
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Challenge mode here is to pause now and see if you can predict how that comparison might

186
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
go.

187
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,080
Let's label each one of these rings based on the angle theta between a line from the

188
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,560
sphere's center to that ring, and the z-axis.

189
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,560
So theta ranges from 0 at the north pole all the way up to 180 degrees at the south pole,

190
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,640
which is to say from 0 to pi radians.

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,280
Let's call the change in the angle from one ring to the next d-theta, which means

192
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,480
the thickness of those rings will be the radius r times d-theta.

193
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,080
Structured exercise time will ease in with a warm-up.

194
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,280
Question 1, what is the circumference of this ring, say at the inner edge, in terms of r

195
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
and theta?

196
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,040
Once you have that, multiply the answer by the thickness r times d-theta to get an approximation

197
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,840
for the ring's area, an approximation that will get better and better as you chop up

198
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,640
the sphere more and more finely.

199
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,800
At this point, if you know your calculus, you could integrate, but our goal is not just

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,040
to find the answer, it's to feel the connection between the sphere and its shadow.

201
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,560
Question 2, what is the area of the shadow of one of these rings on the xy-plane, again

202
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,560
expressed in terms of r, theta, and d-theta?

203
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,880
For this one, it might be helpful to think back to that tiny little right triangle we

204
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,800
were talking about earlier.

205
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,020
Question 3, and this is really the heart of it, each one of these rings' shadows has

206
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,760
precisely half the area of one of the rings on the sphere.

207
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,120
It's not the one that's an angle theta straight above it, but another one.

208
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,640
The question is, which one?

209
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:34,980
As a hint, you might want to reference some trig identities for this one.

210
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,520
Question 4, I said at the outset that there's a correspondence between all of the shadows

211
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,420
from the northern hemisphere, which make up a circle with radius r, and every second ring

212
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,200
on the sphere.

213
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:56,640
Use your answer to the last question to spell out what exactly that correspondence is.

214
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,880
And for question 5, bring it on home.

215
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,760
Why does this imply that the area of the circle is exactly one-fourth the surface area of

216
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,760
the sphere, particularly as we consider thinner and thinner rings?

217
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,800
If you want answers or hints, I'm quite sure people in comments and on reddit will

218
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,260
have them waiting for you.

219
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,820
Finally, I would be remiss not to make a brief mention of the fact that the surface area

220
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,440
of a sphere is a very specific instance of a much more general fact.

221
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,060
If you take any convex shape and look at the average area of all of its shadows, averaged

222
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,340
over all possible orientations in 3D space, that average will be exactly one-fourth the

223
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,080
surface area of your shape.

224
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,760
As to why this is true, I'll have to leave those details for another day.

225
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,460
Thanks for watching!
