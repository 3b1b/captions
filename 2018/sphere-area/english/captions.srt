1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,968
Some of you may have seen in school that the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r squared, 

2
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:12,537
a suspiciously suggestive formula given that it's a clean multiple of the more 

3
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:16,239
popular pi r squared, the area of a circle with the same radius.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,380
But have you ever wondered why this is true?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,084
And I don't just mean proving the 4 pi r squared formula, 

6
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:27,449
I mean viscerally feeling to your bones a connection between this surface area 

7
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,720
and these four circles.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,403
How lovely would it be if there were some subtle shift in perspective that shows 

9
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:37,680
how you could nicely and perfectly fit these four circles onto the sphere's surface?

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,269
Nothing can be quite that simple since the curvature of a sphere's 

11
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:45,375
surface is different from the curvature of a flat plane, 

12
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:50,060
which is why trying to fit, say, a piece of paper around the sphere just doesn't work.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,443
Nevertheless, I would like to show you two separate ways of thinking 

14
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:58,060
about the surface area that connect it in a satisfying way to these circles.

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,598
The first comes from a classic, one of the true gems of geometry 

16
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:04,591
that I think all math students should experience the same way 

17
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,440
all English students should read at least some Shakespeare.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,729
The second line of reasoning is something of my own, 

19
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:13,880
which draws a more direct line between the sphere and its shadow.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,819
And lastly, I'll share why this fourfold relation is not unique to spheres, 

21
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,150
but is instead one specific instance of a much more general 

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,760
fact for all convex shapes in three dimensions.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,968
Starting with the bird's eye view here, the idea for the first approach is to 

24
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:34,271
show that the surface area of the sphere is the same as the area of a cylinder 

25
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:37,975
with the same radius and the same height as that sphere, or rather, 

26
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:42,660
a cylinder without the top and bottom, what you might call the label of that cylinder.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,320
And once you have that, you can unwrap that label to understand it simply as a rectangle.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,043
The width of this rectangle comes from the cylinder's circumference, 

29
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:57,466
so it's 2 pi times r, and the height comes from the height of the sphere, 

30
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:59,140
which is 2 times the radius.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,040
And this already gives us the formula, 4 pi r squared when we multiply the two.

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,241
But in the spirit of mathematical playfulness, 

33
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:11,800
it's nice to see how four circles with radius r can actually fit into this picture.

34
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,562
The idea will be to unwrap each circle into a triangle without changing its area, 

35
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:21,300
and then to fit those nicely into the unfolded cylinder label.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,480
More on that in a couple minutes.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,426
The more pressing question is, why on earth should 

38
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:29,040
the sphere be related to the cylinder in this way?

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,160
The way I'm animating it is already suggestive of how this might work.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,508
The idea is to approximate the area of the sphere with many tiny rectangles covering it, 

41
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:43,681
and to show how if you project these rectangles directly outward, 

42
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,855
as if casting a shadow by little lights positioned on the z-axis, 

43
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:53,356
pointing parallel to the xy-plane, the projection of each rectangle onto the cylinder, 

44
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:57,720
surprisingly, ends up having the same area as the original rectangle.

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
But why should that be?

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
There are two competing effects at play here.

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,955
For one of these rectangles, let's call the side along the latitude lines its width, 

48
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,600
and the side along the longitude lines its height.

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,100
On the one hand, as the rectangle is projected outward, its width will get scaled up.

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,109
For rectangles towards the poles, that length is scaled up quite a bit, 

51
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,440
since they're projected over a longer distance.

52
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,820
But for those closer to the equator, the effect might be close to nothing.

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,332
But on the other hand, because these rectangles are at a slant with respect to the 

54
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:44,460
z-direction, during this projection, the height of each rectangle will get scaled down.

55
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,980
Think about holding some flat object and looking at its shadow.

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,480
As you reorient that object, the shadow looks more or less squished for some angles.

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,333
Take a look, those rectangles towards the poles are quite slanted this way, 

58
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,780
so their height will get squished down by a lot.

59
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,512
For those closer to the equator, oriented somewhere closer to parallel to the z-axis, 

60
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,100
the effect is not as much.

61
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,496
It will turn out that these two effects of stretching the 

62
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:14,620
width and squishing the height cancel each other out perfectly.

63
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,446
Already, as a rough sketch, wouldn't you agree 

64
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,399
that this is a very pretty way of reasoning?

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,428
Of course, the meat here comes from showing why these two competing 

66
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,845
effects cancel each other out, and in some ways the details fleshing 

67
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:31,660
this out are just as pretty as the zoomed out structure of the full argument.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
So let's dig in.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Let me go ahead and cut away half of the sphere so that we can get a better look.

70
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,980
For any mathematical problem solving, it never hurts to start by giving things names.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,408
So let's say that the radius of the sphere is r, and for one specific rectangle, 

72
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:52,240
let's call the distance between that rectangle and the z-axis d.

73
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,230
You could rightfully complain that the distance d is a little ambiguous, 

74
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,180
depending on which point of that rectangle you're going from.

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,924
But for tinier and tinier rectangles, that ambiguity will become negligible, 

76
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:08,929
and tinier and tinier is when this approximation with rectangles 

77
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:11,640
gets closer to the true surface area anyway.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,837
To choose an arbitrary standard, let's say that 

79
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:17,300
d is the distance from the bottom of the rectangle.

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,480
To think about projecting this out to the cylinder, we'll picture two similar triangles.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,124
The first one shares its base with the base of the rectangle on the sphere, 

82
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:32,680
and has a height but on the z-axis, a distance d away.

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,880
The second triangle is a scaled-up version of this, 

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,000
scaled so that it just barely reaches the cylinder, 

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,460
meaning its long side now has a length r.

86
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,388
So the ratio of their bases, which is how much our rectangle's width gets stretched out, 

87
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:50,620
is r divided by d.

88
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,320
What about the height?

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
How precisely does that get scaled down as we project?

90
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,140
Again, let's slice a cross-section for a cleaner view.

91
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,632
In fact, why don't we go ahead and completely 

92
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,860
focus our view to this two-dimensional cross-section.

93
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,497
To think about the projection, let's make a little right triangle, 

94
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:14,300
like this, where what was the height of our spherical rectangle is the hypotenuse, 

95
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,500
and the projection is one of the legs.

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,906
Pro tip, any time you're doing geometry with circles or spheres, 

97
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:24,437
keep in the forefront of your mind that anything tangent to the 

98
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:28,300
circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to that point of tangency.

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,020
It's crazy just how helpful that one little fact can be for making progress.

100
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,047
In our case, once we draw that radial line, together with the distance d, 

101
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,760
we have another right triangle.

102
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,142
And often in geometry, I like to imagine tweaking the parameters 

103
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:47,160
of a setup and imagining how the relevant shapes change.

104
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,000
This helps to make guesses about what the relations might be.

105
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,469
In this case, you might predict that the two triangles I've drawn are similar 

106
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:59,260
to each other, since their shapes seem to change in concert with each other.

107
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,660
This is indeed true, but as always, don't take my word for it.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,900
See if you can justify this for yourself.

109
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,160
Again, it never hurts to give more names to things.

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Maybe let's call this angle alpha, and this other one beta.

111
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,580
Since this is a right triangle, we know that alpha 

112
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,460
plus beta plus 90 degrees must be 180 degrees.

113
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,806
Now let's zoom in on our little triangle and see 

114
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,160
if we can figure out what its angles might be.

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,103
Notice this 90 degree angle, which comes from the radius being 

116
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:34,452
perpendicular to the tangent, and how when it's combined with 

117
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:38,180
this beta here and some other little angle, it forms a straight line.

118
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,460
So that other little angle must be alpha.

119
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,606
This lets us fill out a few more values, which reveals that this little triangle 

120
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:53,400
also has angles alpha, beta, and 90 degrees, so it is indeed similar to the big one.

121
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,680
Deep in the weeds like this, it's sometimes easy to forget why we're doing this.

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,041
Remember, what we want to know is how much the height of the sphere 

123
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,891
rectangle gets squished down as we project it out, 

124
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:09,140
and that's the ratio of this little hypotenuse to the leg on the right side.

125
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,482
By the similarity with the big triangle, the ratio 

126
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,300
of those two sides is again r divided by d.

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,763
So indeed, as this rectangle gets projected outward, 

128
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:23,523
the effect of stretching out the width is perfectly cancelled out by how much that height 

129
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,480
is getting squished due to the slant.

130
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,510
As a fun side note, you might notice that it looks like the 

131
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,260
projected rectangle is a 90 degree rotation of the original.

132
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,169
This would not at all be true in general, but by a lovely coincidence, 

133
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,230
the way I'm parameterizing the sphere results in rectangles where 

134
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,800
the ratio of the width to the height starts out as d to r.

135
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,706
So for this very specific case, rescaling the width by r over d, 

136
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:54,624
and rescaling the height by d over r, actually does have the effect of a 90 

137
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,660
degree rotation.

138
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,598
And this lends itself to a rather bizarre way to animate the relation, 

139
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:04,611
where instead of projecting each rectangular piece as if casting a shadow, 

140
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:09,320
you can rotate each one of them 90 degrees, and rearrange them all to make the cylinder.

141
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,473
Now if you're really thinking critically, you might still not be 

142
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:23,118
satisfied that this shows us what the surface area of the sphere is, 

143
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:27,080
because all of these little rectangles only approximate the relevant areas.

144
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,071
Well, the idea is that this approximation gets closer 

145
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,580
and closer to the true value for finer and finer coverings.

146
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,014
And since for any specific covering, the sphere rectangles have the 

147
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:42,949
same area as the cylinder rectangles, whatever value each of these 

148
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,120
two series of approximations are approaching must actually be the same.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,918
I mean, as you get really aggressively philosophical about what we even 

150
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:55,836
mean by surface area, these sorts of rectangular approximations are not 

151
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:59,863
just aids in our problem-solving toolbox, they end up serving as a way to 

152
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:04,000
rigorously define the idea of area in the context of smooth curved surfaces.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,760
This kind of reasoning is essentially calculus, just without any of the jargon.

154
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,156
In fact, I think neat geometric arguments like this, 

155
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:15,058
which require no background in calculus to understand, 

156
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:18,698
can serve as a great way to tee things up for new calculus students, 

157
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:23,183
so that they have the core ideas already in their head before seeing the definitions 

158
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:26,560
which make them precise, rather than going the other way around.

159
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,390
Alright, so as I said before, if you're the kind of person who's 

160
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,540
just itching to see a direct connection to these four circles, 

161
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,840
one nice way to do that is to unwrap those circles into triangles.

162
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,735
If this is something you haven't seen before, I go into much more 

163
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:45,040
detail about why this works in the first video of the calculus series.

164
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,870
The basic idea is to relate thin concentric rings of 

165
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,960
the circle with horizontal slices of this triangle.

166
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,513
Because the circumference of each such ring increases linearly in proportion 

167
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:02,240
to the radius, always 2 pi times that radius, when you unwrap them all and 

168
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,148
line them up like this, their ends will form a straight line, 

169
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:11,380
as opposed to some other curved shape, which gives us a triangle with base 2 pi r, 

170
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,200
and height r.

171
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,145
And four of these unwrapped circles fit perfectly into our rectangle, 

172
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:20,920
which is in some sense an unwrapped version of the sphere's surface.

173
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,658
Now that's pretty satisfying, but you might nevertheless be wondering 

174
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:29,737
if there's some way to relate this sphere directly to a circle with the same radius, 

175
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:32,520
rather than going through this intermediary of a cylinder.

176
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,873
I do have proof for you to this effect, leveraging a little trigonometry, 

177
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:40,998
though I have to admit I still think the comparison to the cylinder wins out on raw 

178
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:41,440
elegance.

179
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,799
Now I'm a big believer that the best way to really learn math is to do 

180
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,417
problems for yourself, which is a bit hypocritical coming from a channel 

181
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,134
essentially consisting of lectures, so I'm going to try something a little 

182
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:57,100
different here, and present the proof as a heavily-guided sequence of exercises.

183
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,460
Yes, I know that's less fun, and it means you have to pull out some paper 

184
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,100
to do a little work, but I guarantee you will get more out of it this way.

185
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,233
At a high level, the approach will be to cut the sphere into 

186
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:14,067
many thin rings parallel to the xy-plane, and compare the area 

187
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,720
of these rings to the area of their shadows on the xy-plane.

188
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,919
All of the shadows of the rings from, say, the northern hemisphere, 

189
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,060
make up a circle with the same radius as the sphere, right?

190
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,760
The main idea will be to show a correspondence between 

191
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,000
these ring shadows and every second ring on the sphere.

192
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,070
Challenge mode here is to pause now and see if 

193
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,360
you can predict how that comparison might go.

194
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,624
Let's label each one of these rings based on the angle theta 

195
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:47,680
between a line from the sphere's center to that ring, and the z-axis.

196
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,411
So theta ranges from 0 at the north pole all the way up to 180 degrees at the south pole, 

197
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:56,800
which is to say from 0 to pi radians.

198
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,116
And let's call the change in the angle from one ring to the next d-theta, 

199
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:06,920
which means the thickness of those rings will be the radius r times d-theta.

200
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
All right, structured exercise time.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,640
We'll ease in with a warm-up.

202
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,902
Question number one, what is the circumference of this ring, 

203
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:20,100
say, at the inner edge, in terms of r and theta?

204
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,983
Once you have that, go ahead and multiply the answer by the thickness, 

205
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:29,427
r times d-theta, to get an approximation for the ring's area, 

206
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:33,593
an approximation that will get better and better as you chop up the sphere 

207
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:34,760
more and more finely.

208
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,559
At this point, if you know your calculus, you could integrate, 

209
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,199
but our goal is not just to find the answer, it's to feel the connection between the 

210
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,400
sphere and its shadow.

211
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,469
So question number two, what is the area of the shadow of one of these 

212
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:58,920
rings on the x-y plane, again expressed in terms of r, theta, and d-theta?

213
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,927
For this one, it might be helpful to think back to that 

214
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:04,520
tiny little right triangle we were talking about earlier.

215
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,463
Question number three, and this is really the heart of it, 

216
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:16,408
each one of these rings' shadows has precisely half the area of one of the 

217
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:17,460
rings on the sphere.

218
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,500
It's not the one that's an angle theta straight above it, but another one.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,580
The question is, which one?

220
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,760
As a hint, you might want to reference some trig identities for this one.

221
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,284
Question number four, I said at the outset that there's a correspondence 

222
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:41,302
between all of the shadows from the northern hemisphere, 

223
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:45,220
which make up a circle with radius r, and every second ring on the sphere.

224
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,900
Use your answer to the last question to spell out what exactly that correspondence is.

225
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,560
And for question five, bring it on home.

226
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,052
Why does this imply that the area of the circle is exactly one-fourth the 

227
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:07,720
surface area of the sphere, particularly as we consider thinner and thinner rings?

228
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,310
If you want answers or hints, I'm quite sure that people 

229
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,000
in comments and on Reddit will have them waiting for you.

230
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,500
And finally, I would be remiss not to make at least a brief mention of the fact that 

231
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,840
the surface area of a sphere is a very specific instance of a much more general fact.

232
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,676
If you take any convex shape and look at the average area of all of its shadows, 

233
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:33,259
averaged over all possible orientations in 3D space, 

234
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:38,060
that average will be exactly one-fourth the surface area of your shape.

235
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,460
As to why this is true, I'll have to leave those details for another day.
