1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,820
Some of you may have seen in school that the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r squared,

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,060
a suspiciously suggestive formula given that it's a clean multiple of the more popular

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,240
pi r squared, the area of a circle with the same radius.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,380
But have you ever wondered why this is true?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,460
And I don't just mean proving the 4 pi r squared formula, I mean viscerally feeling

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,720
to your bones a connection between this surface area and these four circles.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,340
How lovely would it be if there were some subtle shift in perspective that shows how

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,680
you could nicely and perfectly fit these four circles onto the sphere's surface?

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,740
Nothing can be quite that simple since the curvature of a sphere's surface is different

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,280
from the curvature of a flat plane, which is why trying to fit, say, a piece of paper

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,060
around the sphere just doesn't work.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,900
Nevertheless, I would like to show you two separate ways of thinking about the surface

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,060
area that connect it in a satisfying way to these circles.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,260
The first comes from a classic, one of the true gems of geometry that I think all math

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,000
students should experience the same way all English students should read at least some

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,440
Shakespeare.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,860
The second line of reasoning is something of my own, which draws a more direct line

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,880
between the sphere and its shadow.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,140
And lastly, I'll share why this fourfold relation is not unique to spheres, but is

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,340
instead one specific instance of a much more general fact for all convex shapes in three

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,760
dimensions.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,580
Starting with the bird's eye view here, the idea for the first approach is to show

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,340
that the surface area of the sphere is the same as the area of a cylinder with the same

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,780
radius and the same height as that sphere, or rather, a cylinder without the top and

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,660
bottom, what you might call the label of that cylinder.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,320
And once you have that, you can unwrap that label to understand it simply as a rectangle.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,900
The width of this rectangle comes from the cylinder's circumference, so it's 2 pi

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,140
times r, and the height comes from the height of the sphere, which is 2 times the radius.

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,040
And this already gives us the formula, 4 pi r squared when we multiply the two.

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,600
But in the spirit of mathematical playfulness, it's nice to see how four circles with radius

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
r can actually fit into this picture.

32
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,160
The idea will be to unwrap each circle into a triangle without changing its area, and

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,300
then to fit those nicely into the unfolded cylinder label.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,480
More on that in a couple minutes.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,360
The more pressing question is, why on earth should the sphere be related to the cylinder

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,040
in this way?

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,160
The way I'm animating it is already suggestive of how this might work.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,140
The idea is to approximate the area of the sphere with many tiny rectangles covering

39
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,480
it, and to show how if you project these rectangles directly outward, as if casting a shadow by

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,220
little lights positioned on the z-axis, pointing parallel to the xy-plane, the projection of

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,180
each rectangle onto the cylinder, surprisingly, ends up having the same area as the original

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,720
rectangle.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
But why should that be?

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
There are two competing effects at play here.

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,900
For one of these rectangles, let's call the side along the latitude lines its width,

46
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,600
and the side along the longitude lines its height.

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,100
On the one hand, as the rectangle is projected outward, its width will get scaled up.

48
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,760
For rectangles towards the poles, that length is scaled up quite a bit, since they're

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,440
projected over a longer distance.

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,820
But for those closer to the equator, the effect might be close to nothing.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,960
But on the other hand, because these rectangles are at a slant with respect to the z-direction,

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,460
during this projection, the height of each rectangle will get scaled down.

53
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,980
Think about holding some flat object and looking at its shadow.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,480
As you reorient that object, the shadow looks more or less squished for some angles.

55
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,560
Take a look, those rectangles towards the poles are quite slanted this way, so their

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,780
height will get squished down by a lot.

57
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,780
For those closer to the equator, oriented somewhere closer to parallel to the z-axis,

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,100
the effect is not as much.

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,560
It will turn out that these two effects of stretching the width and squishing the height

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,620
cancel each other out perfectly.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,400
Already, as a rough sketch, wouldn't you agree that this is a very pretty way of reasoning?

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,180
Of course, the meat here comes from showing why these two competing effects cancel each

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,380
other out, and in some ways the details fleshing this out are just as pretty as the zoomed

64
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,660
out structure of the full argument.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
So let's dig in.

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Let me go ahead and cut away half of the sphere so that we can get a better look.

67
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,980
For any mathematical problem solving, it never hurts to start by giving things names.

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,560
So let's say that the radius of the sphere is r, and for one specific rectangle, let's

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
call the distance between that rectangle and the z-axis d.

70
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,180
You could rightfully complain that the distance d is a little ambiguous, depending on which

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
point of that rectangle you're going from.

72
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,440
But for tinier and tinier rectangles, that ambiguity will become negligible, and tinier

73
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,760
and tinier is when this approximation with rectangles gets closer to the true surface

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,640
area anyway.

75
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,740
To choose an arbitrary standard, let's say that d is the distance from the bottom of

76
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,300
the rectangle.

77
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,480
To think about projecting this out to the cylinder, we'll picture two similar triangles.

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,800
The first one shares its base with the base of the rectangle on the sphere, and has a

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,680
height but on the z-axis, a distance d away.

80
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,840
The second triangle is a scaled-up version of this, scaled so that it just barely reaches

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,460
the cylinder, meaning its long side now has a length r.

82
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,860
So the ratio of their bases, which is how much our rectangle's width gets stretched

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,620
out, is r divided by d.

84
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,320
What about the height?

85
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
How precisely does that get scaled down as we project?

86
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,140
Again, let's slice a cross-section for a cleaner view.

87
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,860
In fact, why don't we go ahead and completely focus our view to this two-dimensional cross-section.

88
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,120
To think about the projection, let's make a little right triangle, like this, where

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,760
what was the height of our spherical rectangle is the hypotenuse, and the projection is one

90
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,500
of the legs.

91
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,580
Pro tip, any time you're doing geometry with circles or spheres, keep in the forefront

92
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,000
of your mind that anything tangent to the circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,300
to that point of tangency.

94
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,020
It's crazy just how helpful that one little fact can be for making progress.

95
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,040
In our case, once we draw that radial line, together with the distance d, we have another

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,760
right triangle.

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,660
And often in geometry, I like to imagine tweaking the parameters of a setup and imagining how

98
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,160
the relevant shapes change.

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,000
This helps to make guesses about what the relations might be.

100
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,480
In this case, you might predict that the two triangles I've drawn are similar to each

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,260
other, since their shapes seem to change in concert with each other.

102
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,660
This is indeed true, but as always, don't take my word for it.

103
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,900
See if you can justify this for yourself.

104
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,160
Again, it never hurts to give more names to things.

105
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Maybe let's call this angle alpha, and this other one beta.

106
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:21,460
Since this is a right triangle, we know that alpha plus beta plus 90 degrees must be 180 degrees.

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,320
Now let's zoom in on our little triangle and see if we can figure out what its angles

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,160
might be.

109
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,980
Notice this 90 degree angle, which comes from the radius being perpendicular to the tangent,

110
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,340
and how when it's combined with this beta here and some other little angle, it forms

111
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,180
a straight line.

112
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,460
So that other little angle must be alpha.

113
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,000
This lets us fill out a few more values, which reveals that this little triangle also has

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,400
angles alpha, beta, and 90 degrees, so it is indeed similar to the big one.

115
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,680
Deep in the weeds like this, it's sometimes easy to forget why we're doing this.

116
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,800
Remember, what we want to know is how much the height of the sphere rectangle gets squished

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,220
down as we project it out, and that's the ratio of this little hypotenuse to the leg

118
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,140
on the right side.

119
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,780
By the similarity with the big triangle, the ratio of those two sides is again r divided

120
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,300
by d.

121
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,420
So indeed, as this rectangle gets projected outward, the effect of stretching out the

122
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,100
width is perfectly cancelled out by how much that height is getting squished due to the

123
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,480
slant.

124
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,580
As a fun side note, you might notice that it looks like the projected rectangle is a

125
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,260
90 degree rotation of the original.

126
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,260
This would not at all be true in general, but by a lovely coincidence, the way I'm

127
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,600
parameterizing the sphere results in rectangles where the ratio of the width to the height

128
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
starts out as d to r.

129
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,240
So for this very specific case, rescaling the width by r over d, and rescaling the height

130
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,660
by d over r, actually does have the effect of a 90 degree rotation.

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
And this lends itself to a rather bizarre way to animate the relation, where instead

132
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,000
of projecting each rectangular piece as if casting a shadow, you can rotate each one

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,320
of them 90 degrees, and rearrange them all to make the cylinder.

134
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Now if you're really thinking critically, you might still not be satisfied that this

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,900
shows us what the surface area of the sphere is, because all of these little rectangles

136
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,080
only approximate the relevant areas.

137
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,060
Well, the idea is that this approximation gets closer and closer to the true value for

138
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,580
finer and finer coverings.

139
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,360
And since for any specific covering, the sphere rectangles have the same area as the cylinder

140
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,720
rectangles, whatever value each of these two series of approximations are approaching must

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
actually be the same.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,120
I mean, as you get really aggressively philosophical about what we even mean by surface area, these

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,380
sorts of rectangular approximations are not just aids in our problem-solving toolbox,

144
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,520
they end up serving as a way to rigorously define the idea of area in the context of

145
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,000
smooth curved surfaces.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,760
This kind of reasoning is essentially calculus, just without any of the jargon.

147
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,940
In fact, I think neat geometric arguments like this, which require no background in

148
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,540
calculus to understand, can serve as a great way to tee things up for new calculus students,

149
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,440
so that they have the core ideas already in their head before seeing the definitions which

150
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
make them precise, rather than going the other way around.

151
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,900
Alright, so as I said before, if you're the kind of person who's just itching to

152
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,640
see a direct connection to these four circles, one nice way to do that is to unwrap those

153
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,840
circles into triangles.

154
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,840
If this is something you haven't seen before, I go into much more detail about why this

155
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,040
works in the first video of the calculus series.

156
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,140
The basic idea is to relate thin concentric rings of the circle with horizontal slices

157
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,960
of this triangle.

158
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,840
Because the circumference of each such ring increases linearly in proportion to the radius,

159
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,800
always 2 pi times that radius, when you unwrap them all and line them up like this, their

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,680
ends will form a straight line, as opposed to some other curved shape, which gives us

161
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,200
a triangle with base 2 pi r, and height r.

162
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,340
And four of these unwrapped circles fit perfectly into our rectangle, which is in some sense

163
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,920
an unwrapped version of the sphere's surface.

164
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,340
Now that's pretty satisfying, but you might nevertheless be wondering if there's some

165
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,900
way to relate this sphere directly to a circle with the same radius, rather than going through

166
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,520
this intermediary of a cylinder.

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,040
I do have proof for you to this effect, leveraging a little trigonometry, though I have to admit

168
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,440
I still think the comparison to the cylinder wins out on raw elegance.

169
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,140
Now I'm a big believer that the best way to really learn math is to do problems for

170
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,960
yourself, which is a bit hypocritical coming from a channel essentially consisting of lectures,

171
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,720
so I'm going to try something a little different here, and present the proof as a heavily-guided

172
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,100
sequence of exercises.

173
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,400
Yes, I know that's less fun, and it means you have to pull out some paper to do a little

174
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,100
work, but I guarantee you will get more out of it this way.

175
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,400
At a high level, the approach will be to cut the sphere into many thin rings parallel to

176
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,720
the xy-plane, and compare the area of these rings to the area of their shadows on the xy-plane.

177
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,440
All of the shadows of the rings from, say, the northern hemisphere, make up a circle

178
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,060
with the same radius as the sphere, right?

179
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,820
The main idea will be to show a correspondence between these ring shadows and every second

180
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,000
ring on the sphere.

181
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,360
Challenge mode here is to pause now and see if you can predict how that comparison might go.

182
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,880
Let's label each one of these rings based on the angle theta between a line from the

183
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,680
sphere's center to that ring, and the z-axis.

184
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,060
So theta ranges from 0 at the north pole all the way up to 180 degrees at the south pole,

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,800
which is to say from 0 to pi radians.

186
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,080
And let's call the change in the angle from one ring to the next d-theta, which means

187
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,920
the thickness of those rings will be the radius r times d-theta.

188
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
All right, structured exercise time.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,640
We'll ease in with a warm-up.

190
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Question number one, what is the circumference of this ring, say, at the inner edge, in terms

191
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,100
of r and theta?

192
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,540
Once you have that, go ahead and multiply the answer by the thickness, r times d-theta,

193
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,560
to get an approximation for the ring's area, an approximation that will get better and

194
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,760
better as you chop up the sphere more and more finely.

195
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,820
At this point, if you know your calculus, you could integrate, but our goal is not just

196
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,400
to find the answer, it's to feel the connection between the sphere and its shadow.

197
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,920
So question number two, what is the area of the shadow of one of these rings on the x-y

198
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,920
plane, again expressed in terms of r, theta, and d-theta?

199
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,920
For this one, it might be helpful to think back to that tiny little right triangle we

200
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,520
were talking about earlier.

201
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,220
Question number three, and this is really the heart of it, each one of these rings'

202
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,460
shadows has precisely half the area of one of the rings on the sphere.

203
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,500
It's not the one that's an angle theta straight above it, but another one.

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,580
The question is, which one?

205
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,760
As a hint, you might want to reference some trig identities for this one.

206
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,580
Question number four, I said at the outset that there's a correspondence between all

207
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,340
of the shadows from the northern hemisphere, which make up a circle with radius r, and

208
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,220
every second ring on the sphere.

209
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,900
Use your answer to the last question to spell out what exactly that correspondence is.

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,560
And for question five, bring it on home.

211
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,780
Why does this imply that the area of the circle is exactly one-fourth the surface area of

212
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,720
the sphere, particularly as we consider thinner and thinner rings?

213
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,520
If you want answers or hints, I'm quite sure that people in comments and on Reddit

214
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
will have them waiting for you.

215
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,080
And finally, I would be remiss not to make at least a brief mention of the fact that

216
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,840
the surface area of a sphere is a very specific instance of a much more general fact.

217
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,020
If you take any convex shape and look at the average area of all of its shadows, averaged

218
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,420
over all possible orientations in 3D space, that average will be exactly one-fourth the

219
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,060
surface area of your shape.

220
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,860
As to why this is true, I'll have to leave those details for another day.
