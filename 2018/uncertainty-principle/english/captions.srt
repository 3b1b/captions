1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,580
You've probably heard of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics,

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,440
that the more you know about a particle's position, the less certain you can be of its

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,580
momentum and vice versa.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,160
Michael here is for you to come away from this video feeling like this is utterly reasonable.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,120
It'll take some time, but I think you'll agree that digging deep is well worth it.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,780
You see, the uncertainty principle is actually one specific example of a much more general

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,620
trade-off that shows up in a lot of everyday totally non-quantum circumstances involving

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,620
waves.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,240
The plan here is to see what this means in the context of sound waves, which should feel

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,540
reasonable, and then Doppler radar, which should again feel reasonable and a little

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,900
bit closer to the quantum case, and then for particles, which if you're willing to accept

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,860
one or two premises of quantum mechanics, hopefully feels just as reasonable as the

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,460
first two.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,760
The core idea here has to do with the interplay between frequency and duration, and I bet

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,600
you already have an intuitive idea of this principle before we even get into the math

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,240
or the quantum.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,880
If you were to pull up behind a car at a red light, and your turn signals were flashing

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,120
together for a few seconds, you might kind of think they have the same frequency, but

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,360
at that point for all you know they could fall out of sync as more time passes, revealing

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
that they actually had different frequencies.

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,460
So an observation over a short period of time gave you low confidence over what their frequencies

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
are.

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,740
But, if you were to set it at that red light for a full minute, and the signals continued

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,800
to click in sync, you would be a lot more confident that the frequencies are actually

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,960
the same.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,520
So that certainty about the frequency information required an observation spread out over time.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,600
And this trade-off right here, between how short your observation can be and how confident

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,340
you can feel about the frequency, is an example of the general uncertainty principle.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,900
Similarly, think of a musical note.

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,180
The shorter it lasts in time, the less certain you can be about what its exact frequency

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
is.

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,380
In the extreme, I could ask you what the pitch of a clap or shockwave is, and even someone

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,140
with perfect pitch would be unable to answer.

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,820
And on the flip side, a more definite frequency requires a longer duration signal.

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,560
Or rather than talking about definiteness or certainty, it would be a little more accurate

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,600
here to say that the short signal correlates highly with a wider range of frequency, and

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,000
that the signal correlating strongly with only a narrow range of frequencies must last

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
for a longer time.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Here, that's the kind of phrase that's made a little clearer when we bring in the

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,680
actual math, so let's turn now to talking about the Fourier transform, which is the

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,620
relevant construct for analyzing frequencies.

42
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,300
The last video I put out was a visual intuition for this transform, and yes, it would be helpful

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,180
if you've seen it, but I'll give a quick recap here to remind ourselves how it went.

44
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,620
Let's say you have a signal, and it plays 5 beats per second over the course of 2 seconds.

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,780
The Fourier transform gives a way to view any signal not in terms of the intensity at

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,380
each point in time, but instead in terms of the strength of various frequencies within

47
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
it.

48
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,420
The main idea was to take this signal and kind of wind it around a circle, as in, imagine

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,300
some rotating vector whose length is determined by the height of the graph at each point in

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
time.

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,880
Right now, this little vector is rotating at 0.3 cycles per second, that's the frequency

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,100
with which we're winding the graph around the circle.

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,440
And for most frequencies, the signal is kind of just averaged out over the circle.

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
This was the fun part of last video, don't you think?

55
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Just seeing the different patterns that come up as you wind a pure cosine around a circle

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,260
like this.

57
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,620
But the key point is what happens when that winding frequency matches the signal frequency,

58
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,040
in this case 5 cycles per second.

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
As our little vector is rotating around and it draws, all of the peaks line up on one

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,120
side and all of the valleys on another side, so the whole weight of the graph is kind of

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,800
off-center, so to speak.

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,760
The idea behind the Fourier transform is that if you follow the center of mass of the wound-up

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,600
graph with frequency f, the position of that center of mass encodes the strength of that

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,620
frequency in the original signal.

65
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,080
The distance between that center of mass and the origin captures the strength of that frequency.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
And this is something I didn't really talk about in the main video, but the angle of

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,940
that center of mass off the horizontal corresponds to the phase of the given frequency.

68
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,100
One way to think of this whole winding mechanism is that it's a way to measure how well your

69
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,020
signal correlates with a given pure frequency.

70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,600
So remember, when we say the Fourier transform, we're referring to this new function whose

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,140
input is that winding frequency, and whose output is the center of mass, thought of as

72
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,800
a complex number.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,820
Or more technically, it's a certain multiple of that center of mass, but whatever, the

74
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,980
overall shape remains the same.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,080
And the graph I'm drawing is just going to be the x-coordinate of that center of mass,

76
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,800
the real part of its output.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,360
If you wanted, you could also plot the distance between the center of mass and the origin,

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,300
and maybe that better conveys how strongly each possible frequency correlates with a

79
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
signal.

80
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,480
The downside is that you lose some of the nice linearity properties I talked about last

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
video.

82
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,220
Anyway, point is, this spike above the winding frequency of 5 is the Fourier transform's

83
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,900
way of telling us that the dominant frequency of the signal is 5 beats per second.

84
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,940
And equally importantly, the fact that it's a little bit spread out around that 5 is an

85
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,540
indication that pure sine waves near 5 beats per second also correlate pretty well with

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
the signal.

87
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,420
And that last idea is key for the uncertainty principle.

88
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,580
What I want you to do is think about how this spread changes as the signal persists longer

89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,820
or shorter over time.

90
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,980
You've already seen this at an intuitive level, all we're doing right now is just

91
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,460
illustrating it in the language of Fourier transforms.

92
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,140
If the signal persists over a long period of time, then when the winding frequency is

93
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,340
even slightly different from 5, the signal goes on long enough to wrap itself around

94
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,600
the circle and balance out.

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,980
So looking at the Fourier plot over here, that corresponds to a super sharp drop-off

96
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,540
in the magnitude of the transform as your frequency shifts away from that 5 beats per

97
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,520
second.

98
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,940
On the other hand, if your signal was localized to a short period of time, then as you adjust

99
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,360
the frequency away from 5 beats per second, the signal doesn't really have as much time

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,880
to balance itself out around the circle.

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,920
You have to change the winding frequency to be meaningfully different from 5 before that

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,240
signal starts to balance out again.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,320
Over on the frequency plot, that corresponds to a much broader peak around the 5 beats

104
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,040
per second.

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,920
And that's the uncertainty principle, just phrased a little bit more mathematically.

106
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,160
A signal concentrated in time must have a spread out Fourier transform, meaning it correlates

107
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,000
with a wide range of frequencies, and a signal with a concentrated Fourier transform has

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
to be spread out in time.

109
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,040
And one other place where this comes up in a really tangible way is Doppler radar.

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,240
So with radar, the idea is you send out some radio wave pulse, and the pulse might reflect

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,160
off of objects, and the time it takes for this echo signal to return to you lets you

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,840
deduce how far away those objects are.

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,720
And you can actually take this one step further and make deductions about the velocities of

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
those objects using the Doppler effect.

115
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,880
Think about sending out a pulse with some frequency.

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,920
If this gets reflected off an object moving towards you, then the beats of that wave get

117
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
kind of smushed together, so the echo you hear back is going to be a slightly higher

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,240
frequency.

119
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,440
Fourier transforms give a neat way to view this.

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,000
The Fourier transform of your original signal tells you the frequencies that go into it,

121
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,320
and for simplicity, let's think of that as being dominated by a single pure frequency,

122
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,760
though as you know if it's a short pulse that means our Fourier transform has to be

123
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
spread out a little bit.

124
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,340
And now think about the Doppler shift at echo.

125
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,580
By coming back at a higher frequency, it means that the Fourier transform will just look

126
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,280
like a similar plot shifted up a bit.

127
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,200
Moreover, if you look at the size of that shift, you can deduce how quickly the object

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,640
was moving.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,640
By the way, there is an important technical point that I'm choosing to gloss over here,

130
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,080
and I've outlined it a little more in the video description.

131
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,480
What follows is meant to be a distilled, if somewhat oversimplified description of the

132
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,600
Fourier tradeoff in this setup.

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,960
The salient fact is that time and frequency of that echo signal correspond respectively

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,940
to the position and velocity of the object being measured, which is what makes this example

135
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,400
much more closely analogous to the quantum mechanical Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

136
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,680
You see, there is a very real way in which a radar operator faces a dilemma, where the

137
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,520
more certain you can be about the positions of things, the less certain you are about

138
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
their velocities.

139
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,560
Here imagine sending out a pulse that persists over a long period of time.

140
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,820
Then that means the echo from some object is also spread out over time.

141
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,200
And on its own that might not seem like an issue.

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,160
In practice, there are all sorts of different objects in the field, so these echoes are

143
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,000
all going to start to get overlapped with each other.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,200
Combine that with other noise and imperfections, and this can make the locations of multiple

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,440
objects extremely ambiguous.

146
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,380
Instead, a more precise understanding of how far away all these things are would require

147
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,160
having a very quick little pulse confined to a small amount of time.

148
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,500
But think about the frequency representations of such a short echo.

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,880
As you saw with the sound example, the Fourier transform of a quick pulse is necessarily

150
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,660
more spread out.

151
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,740
So for many objects with various velocities, that would mean that the Doppler shifted echoes,

152
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,060
despite having been nicely separated in time, are more likely to overlap in frequency space.

153
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,020
So since what you're looking at is the sum of all of these, it can be really ambiguous

154
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,720
how you break it down.

155
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,340
If you wanted a nice clean sharp view of the velocities, you would need to have an echo

156
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,340
that only occupies a very small amount of frequency space.

157
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,580
But for a signal to be concentrated in frequency space, it necessarily has to be spread out

158
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,780
in time.

159
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,100
This is the Fourier tradeoff, you cannot have crisp delineation for both.

160
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,220
And this brings us to the quantum case.

161
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,140
Do you know who else spent some time immersed in the pragmatic world of radio wave transmissions?

162
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,740
A young, otherwise philosophically inclined history major in WWI France, Louis de Broglie.

163
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,460
And this was a strangely fitting post, given his predispositions to philosophizing about

164
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,940
the nature of waves, because after the war, as de Broglie switched from the humanities

165
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:52,700
to physics, in his 1924 PhD thesis, he proposed that all matter has wave-like properties.

166
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,340
And more than that, he concluded that the momentum of any moving particle is proportional

167
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:04,660
to the spatial frequency of that wave, how many times that wave cycles per unit distance.

168
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:13,180
Okay, now that's the kind of phrase that can easily fly into one ear and out the other.

169
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,940
Because as soon as you say matter is a wave, it's easy to throw up your hands and say

170
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,380
physics is just weird.

171
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,580
But really, think about this.

172
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Even if you're willing to grant that particles behave like waves, in some way, whatever that

173
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,460
means, why on earth should the momentum of those particles, the thing we classically

174
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,700
think of as mass times velocity, have anything to do with the spatial frequency of that wave?

175
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,580
Now, being more of a math than a physics guy, I asked a number of people with deeper backgrounds

176
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,660
in physics about helpful intuitions here, and one thing that became clear is that there

177
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,460
is a surprising variety of viewpoints.

178
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Now personally, one thing I found to be interesting was just going back to the source and seeing

179
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,420
how de Broglie framed things in his seminal paper on the topic.

180
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,260
You see, there is a sense in which it's not all that different from the Doppler effect,

181
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,900
where relative movement corresponds to shifts in frequency.

182
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,820
It has a slightly different flavor, since we're not talking about frequency over time,

183
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,380
instead we're talking about frequency over space, and special relativity is going to

184
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,620
come into play.

185
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,500
But I still think it's an interesting analogy.

186
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,940
In his thesis, de Broglie lays out what is, in his own words, a crude comparison for the

187
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,620
kind of wave phenomenon he has in mind.

188
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,460
Imagine many weights hanging from springs, with all of these weights oscillating up and

189
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:33,380
down in sync, and with most of the mass concentrated towards a single point.

190
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,380
The energy of these oscillating weights is meant to be a metaphor for the energy of a

191
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,100
particle, specifically the E equals mc squared style energy residing in its mass, and de

192
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,160
Broglie emphasized how the conception he had in mind involves the particle being dispersed

193
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,060
across all of space.

194
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,220
The whole premise he was exploring here is that the energy of a particle might have to

195
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,800
do with something that oscillates over time, since this was known to be the case for photons,

196
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,220
and these oscillating weights are meant to be a metaphor for whatever that something

197
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,740
might be.

198
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,620
With Einstein's relatively new theory of relativity in mind, he pointed out that if

199
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,640
you view this whole setup while moving relative to it, all of the weights are going to appear

200
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,860
to fall out of phase.

201
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:23,100
That's not obvious, and I'm certainly exaggerating the effect in this animation.

202
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,780
It has to do with a core fact from special relativity, that what you consider to be simultaneous

203
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:34,360
events in one reference frame may not be simultaneous in a different reference frame.

204
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,780
So even though from one point of view, you might see two of these weights as reaching

205
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,140
their peaks and valleys at the same instant, from a different moving point of view, those

206
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:50,060
events might actually be happening at different times.

207
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,480
Using this more fully requires some knowledge of special relativity, so we'll all just

208
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,960
have to wait for Henry Reich's series on that topic to come out.

209
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,160
Right here our only goal is to get an inkling for why momentum, that thing we usually think

210
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,660
of as mass times velocity, should have anything to do with spatial frequency.

211
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,060
And the basic line of reasoning here is if mass is the same as energy, via E equals mc

212
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,340
squared, and if that energy was carried as some kind of oscillating phenomenon, similar

213
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,540
to how it is for photons, then this sort of relativistic Doppler effect means changes

214
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,460
to how that mass moves corresponds to changes in the spatial frequency.

215
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,340
So what does our general Fourier tradeoff tell us in this case?

216
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:37,900
Well if a particle is described as a little wave packet over space, then the Fourier transform,

217
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,820
where we're thinking of this as a function over space, not over time, tells us how much

218
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:50,900
various pure frequencies correspond with this top wave.

219
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,120
So if the momentum is the spatial frequency, up to a constant multiple, then the momentum

220
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,620
is also a kind of wave, namely some multiple of the Fourier transform of the original wave.

221
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,640
So if that original wave was very concentrated around a single point, as we have seen multiple

222
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,320
times now, that means its Fourier transform must necessarily be more spread out, hence

223
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,600
the wave describing its momentum must be more spread out, and vice versa.

224
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,960
Notice that unlike the Doppler radar case, where the ambiguity arose because waves were

225
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,600
being used to measure an object with a definite distance and speed, what we're saying here

226
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
is that the particle is the wave.

227
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,480
So the spread out over space and over momentum is not some artifact of imperfect measurement

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,600
techniques, it's a spread fundamental to what the particle is, analogous to how a musical

229
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,600
note being spread out over time is fundamental to what it even means to be a musical note.

230
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,000
One pet peeve I have in mainstream references to quantum is that they often treat Heisenberg's

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,120
uncertainty principle as some fundamental example of things being unknowable in the

232
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,040
quantum realm, as if it is a core nugget of the universe's indeterminacy.

233
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,060
But really, it's just a tradeoff between how concentrated a wave and its frequency

234
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,420
representation can be applied to the premise that matter is some kind of wave, and hence

235
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,720
spread out.

236
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
All of the stuff about randomness and unknowability is still there, but it comes one level deeper

237
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,280
in the way these waves have come to be interpreted.

238
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,780
When you measure these particles, say trying to detect if it's in a given region, whether

239
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,800
or not you find it there appears to be probabilistic, where the probability of finding it is proportional

240
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,900
to the strength of the wave in that region.

241
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,480
So when one of these waves is concentrated near a point, what that actually means is

242
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,620
that we have a higher probability of finding it near that point, that we are more certain

243
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,560
of its location.

244
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,320
And just to beat this drum one more time, since that concentration implies a more spread

245
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,720
out Fourier transform, then the wave describing its momentum would also be more spread out,

246
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,260
so you wouldn't be able to find a narrow range of momenta that the particle has a high

247
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,940
probability of occupying.

248
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,280
I quite like how if you look at the German word for this principle, it might be more

249
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,780
directly translated as the unsharpness relation, which I think more faithfully captures the

250
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,220
Fourier tradeoff at play here without imposing on questions of no ability.

251
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,720
When I think of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, what makes it fascinating is not

252
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,220
so much that it's a statement about randomness.

253
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,260
I mean yes, that randomness is very thought-provoking and contentious and just plain weird, but

254
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,460
to me equally fascinating is that underpinning Heisenberg's conclusion is that position

255
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,260
and momentum have the same relationship as sound and frequency, as if a particle's

256
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,180
momentum is somehow the sheet music describing how it moves through space.
