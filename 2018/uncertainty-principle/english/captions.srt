1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,152
You've probably heard of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics, 

2
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:09,348
that the more you know about a particle's position, 

3
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:11,840
the less certain you can be of its momentum and vice versa.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,823
Michael here is for you to come away from this 

5
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:17,020
video feeling like this is utterly reasonable.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,020
It'll take some time, but I think you'll agree that digging deep is well worth it.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,484
You see, the uncertainty principle is actually one specific 

8
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:27,549
example of a much more general trade-off that shows up in a 

9
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,920
lot of everyday totally non-quantum circumstances involving waves.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,216
The plan here is to see what this means in the context of sound waves, 

11
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:37,905
which should feel reasonable, and then Doppler radar, 

12
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,889
which should again feel reasonable and a little bit closer to the quantum case, 

13
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:46,322
and then for particles, which if you're willing to accept one or two premises of quantum 

14
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:49,460
mechanics, hopefully feels just as reasonable as the first two.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,967
The core idea here has to do with the interplay between frequency and duration, 

16
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:58,595
and I bet you already have an intuitive idea of this principle 

17
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,360
before we even get into the math or the quantum.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,611
If you were to pull up behind a car at a red light, 

19
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,776
and your turn signals were flashing together for a few seconds, 

20
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,446
you might kind of think they have the same frequency, 

21
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:14,600
but at that point for all you know they could fall out of sync as more time passes, 

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,320
revealing that they actually had different frequencies.

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,020
So an observation over a short period of time gave 

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,780
you low confidence over what their frequencies are.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,530
But, if you were to set it at that red light for a full minute, 

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,324
and the signals continued to click in sync, you would be a 

27
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,260
lot more confident that the frequencies are actually the same.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,982
So that certainty about the frequency information 

29
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:39,720
required an observation spread out over time.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,448
And this trade-off right here, between how short your observation can be and how 

31
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,592
confident you can feel about the frequency, is an example of the general uncertainty 

32
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:49,080
principle.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,580
Similarly, think of a musical note.

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,229
The shorter it lasts in time, the less certain 

35
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,460
you can be about what its exact frequency is.

36
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,426
In the extreme, I could ask you what the pitch of a clap or shockwave is, 

37
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:03,280
and even someone with perfect pitch would be unable to answer.

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,840
And on the flip side, a more definite frequency requires a longer duration signal.

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,226
Or rather than talking about definiteness or certainty, 

40
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:17,472
it would be a little more accurate here to say that the short signal 

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,611
correlates highly with a wider range of frequency, 

42
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:24,858
and that the signal correlating strongly with only a narrow range of 

43
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:27,320
frequencies must last for a longer time.

44
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,486
Here, that's the kind of phrase that's made a little clearer when we 

45
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,268
bring in the actual math, so let's turn now to talking about the Fourier transform, 

46
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:38,880
which is the relevant construct for analyzing frequencies.

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,991
The last video I put out was a visual intuition for this transform, 

48
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,967
and yes, it probably would be helpful if you've seen it, 

49
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:49,780
but I'm going to give a quick recap here to remind ourselves how it went.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,020
Let's say you have a signal and it plays 5 beats per second over the course of 2 seconds.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,066
The Fourier transform gives a way to view any signal not in terms of the intensity at 

52
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:04,740
each point in time, but instead in terms of the strength of various frequencies within it.

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,253
The main idea was to take this signal and kind of wind it around a circle, 

54
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:14,532
as in, imagine some rotating vector whose length is determined 

55
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,860
by the height of the graph at each point in time.

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,231
Right now, this little vector is rotating at 0.3 cycles per second, 

57
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:26,140
that's the frequency with which we're winding the graph around the circle.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,500
And for most frequencies, the signal is kind of just averaged out over the circle.

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,200
This was the fun part of last video, don't you think?

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,079
Just seeing the different patterns that come up as 

61
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,500
you wind a pure cosine around a circle like this.

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,500
But the key point is what happens when that winding frequency 

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,240
matches the signal frequency, in this case 5 cycles per second.

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,718
As our little vector is rotating around and it draws, 

65
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:57,850
all of the peaks line up on one side and all of the valleys on another side, 

66
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,500
so the whole weight of the graph is kind of off-center, so to speak.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,934
The idea behind the Fourier transform is that if you follow the center 

68
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,783
of mass of the wound-up graph with frequency f, 

69
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:14,234
the position of that center of mass encodes the strength of that frequency 

70
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,600
in the original signal.

71
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,676
The distance between that center of mass and the origin captures the strength of that 

72
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,493
frequency, and this is something I didn't really talk about in the main video, 

73
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:28,746
but the angle of that center of mass off the horizontal corresponds to the phase of the 

74
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:29,520
given frequency.

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,192
One way to think of this whole winding mechanism is that it's a way 

76
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,860
to measure how well your signal correlates with a given pure frequency.

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,485
So remember, when we say the Fourier transform, 

78
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:46,515
we're referring to this new function whose input is that winding frequency, 

79
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:50,280
and whose output is the center of mass, thought of as a complex number.

80
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,949
Or more technically, it's a certain multiple of that center of mass, 

81
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,300
but whatever, the overall shape remains the same.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,024
And the graph I'm drawing is just going to be the x-coordinate of that center of mass, 

83
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,320
the real part of its output.

84
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,231
If you wanted, you could also plot the distance between the 

85
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,765
center of mass and the origin, and maybe that better conveys 

86
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,340
how strongly each possible frequency correlates with a signal.

87
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,800
The downside is that you lose some of the nice 

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,740
linearity properties I talked about last video.

89
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,498
Anyway, point is, this spike above the winding frequency of 5 is the Fourier transform's 

90
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:26,140
way of telling us that the dominant frequency of the signal is 5 beats per second.

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,692
And equally importantly, the fact that it's a little bit spread 

92
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:34,326
out around that 5 is an indication that pure sine waves near 

93
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:38,020
5 beats per second also correlate pretty well with the signal.

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,820
And that last idea is key for the uncertainty principle.

95
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,482
What I want you to do is think about how this spread 

96
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:48,980
changes as the signal persists longer or shorter over time.

97
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,551
You've already seen this at an intuitive level, 

98
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,460
all we're doing right now is just illustrating it in the language of Fourier transforms.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,792
If the signal persists over a long period of time, 

100
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,460
then when the winding frequency is even slightly different from 5, 

101
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,840
the signal goes on long enough to wrap itself around the circle and balance out.

102
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,256
So looking at the Fourier plot over here, that corresponds to a super sharp drop-off in 

103
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:19,040
the magnitude of the transform as your frequency shifts away from that 5 beats per second.

104
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,746
On the other hand, if your signal was really localized to a short period of time, 

105
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:30,378
then as you adjust the frequency away from 5 beats per second, 

106
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:35,220
the signal doesn't really have as much time to balance itself out around the circle.

107
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,559
You have to change the winding frequency to be meaningfully 

108
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:41,460
different from 5 before that signal starts to balance out again.

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,449
Over on the frequency plot, that corresponds to 

110
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,980
a much broader peak around the 5 beats per second.

111
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,340
And that's the uncertainty principle, just phrased a little bit more mathematically.

112
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,863
A signal concentrated in time must have a spread out Fourier transform, 

113
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:58,884
meaning it correlates with a wide range of frequencies, 

114
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:03,200
and a signal with a concentrated Fourier transform has to be spread out in time.

115
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,220
And one other place where this comes up in a really tangible way is Doppler radar.

116
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,714
With radar, you send out a radio wave pulse, and the pulse might reflect off of objects, 

117
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:17,727
and the time it takes for this echo signal to return to you lets 

118
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:20,320
you deduce how far away those objects are.

119
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,819
You can take this one step further and make deductions about 

120
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,660
the velocities of those objects using the Doppler effect.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,220
Think about sending out a pulse with some frequency.

122
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,929
If this gets reflected off an object moving towards you, 

123
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:36,195
then the beats of that wave get kind of smushed together, 

124
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:40,080
so the echo you hear back is going to be a slightly higher frequency.

125
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,960
Fourier transforms give a neat way to view this.

126
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,582
The Fourier transform of your original signal tells you the frequencies that go into it, 

127
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:53,643
and for simplicity let's think of that as being dominated by a single pure frequency, 

128
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:56,902
though as you know if it's a short pulse that means that our Fourier 

129
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:58,980
transform has to be spread out a little bit.

130
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,320
And now think about the Doppler shifted echo.

131
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,224
By coming back at a higher frequency, it means that the 

132
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:09,060
Fourier transform will look like a similar plot shifted up a bit.

133
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,180
Moreover, if you look at the size of that shift, 

134
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,720
you can deduce how quickly the object was moving.

135
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,136
By the way, there is an important technical point that I'm choosing to gloss over here, 

136
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,520
and I've outlined it a little more in the video description.

137
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,598
What follows is meant to be a distilled, if somewhat 

138
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,860
oversimplified description of the Fourier tradeoff in this setup.

139
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,301
This salient fact is that time and frequency of that echo signal correspond respectively 

140
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:37,551
to the position and velocity of the object being measured, 

141
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:42,342
which is what makes this example much more closely analogous to the quantum mechanical 

142
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:44,159
Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

143
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,677
You see, there is a very real way in which a radar operator faces a dilemma, 

144
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,900
where the more certain you can be about the positions of things, 

145
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,280
the less certain you are about their velocities.

146
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,880
Here, imagine sending out a pulse that persists over a long period of time.

147
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,040
Then that means the echo from some object is also spread out over time.

148
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,580
And on its own, that might not seem like an issue.

149
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,202
But in practice, there's all sorts of different objects in the field, 

150
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:17,500
so these echoes are all going to start to get overlapped with each other.

151
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,385
Combine that with other noise and imperfections, 

152
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:23,980
and this can make the locations of multiple objects extremely ambiguous.

153
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,659
Instead, a more precise understanding of how far away all these things are 

154
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:33,120
would require having a very quick little pulse confined to a small amount of time.

155
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,640
But think about the frequency representations of such a short echo.

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,345
As you saw with the sound example, the Fourier 

157
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,980
transform of a quick pulse is necessarily more spread out.

158
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,122
So for many objects with various velocities, that would mean 

159
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:53,658
that the Doppler shifted echoes, despite having been nicely separated in time, 

160
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:56,300
are more likely to overlap in frequency space.

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,770
So since what you're looking at is the sum of all of these, 

162
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,000
it can be really ambiguous how you break it down.

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,644
If you wanted a nice clean sharp view of the velocities, 

164
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:10,460
you would need to have an echo that only occupies a very small amount of frequency space.

165
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,928
But for a signal to be concentrated in frequency space, 

166
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,120
it necessarily has to be spread out in time.

167
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,940
This is the Fourier tradeoff.

168
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,800
You cannot have crisp delineation for both.

169
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,100
And this brings us to the quantum case.

170
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,679
Do you know who else spent some time immersed in 

171
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,540
the pragmatic world of radio wave transmissions?

172
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,980
A young, otherwise philosophically inclined history major in WWI France, Louis de Broglie.

173
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,837
And this was a strangely fitting post, given his 

174
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,480
predispositions to philosophizing about the nature of waves.

175
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,367
After the war, as de Broglie switched from the humanities to physics, 

176
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:50,240
in his 1924 PhD thesis he proposed that all matter has wave-like properties.

177
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,211
And more than that, he concluded that the momentum of any moving particle is proportional 

178
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:03,800
to the spatial frequency of that wave, how many times that wave cycles per unit distance.

179
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,660
Ok, now that's the kind of phrase that can easily fly into one ear and out the other.

180
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,569
As soon as you say matter is a wave, it's easy to 

181
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,000
throw up your hands and say physics is just weird.

182
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,920
But really, think about this.

183
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,840
Even if you're willing to grant that particles behave like waves, 

184
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,534
in some way, whatever that means, why on earth should the momentum of those particles, 

185
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:31,663
the thing we classically think of as mass times velocity, 

186
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:34,900
have anything to do with the spatial frequency of that wave?

187
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,672
Now being more of a math than a physics guy, I asked a number of people 

188
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:42,764
with deeper backgrounds in physics about helpful intuitions here, 

189
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:46,700
and one thing that became clear is that there is a surprising variety of viewpoints.

190
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,827
Now personally, one thing I found to be interesting was just going back to the 

191
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:54,240
source and seeing how de Broglie framed things in his seminal paper on the topic.

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,226
You see, there is a sense in which it's not all that different from the Doppler effect, 

193
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:02,060
where relative movement corresponds to shifts in frequency.

194
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,612
It has a slightly different flavor, since we're not talking about frequency over time, 

195
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,941
instead we're talking about frequency over space, 

196
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:11,317
and special relativity is going to come into play, 

197
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,460
but I still think it's an interesting analogy.

198
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,490
In his thesis, de Broglie lays out what is, in his own words, 

199
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,100
a crude comparison for the kind of wave phenomenon he has in mind.

200
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,142
Imagine many weights hanging from springs, with all of these weights oscillating 

201
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:31,900
up and down in sync, and with most of the mass concentrated towards a single point.

202
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,875
The energy of these oscillating weights is meant to be a metaphor for 

203
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,518
the energy of a particle, specifically the E equals mc squared style 

204
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:44,425
energy residing in its mass, and de Broglie emphasized how the conception 

205
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:48,280
he had in mind involves the particle being dispersed across all of space.

206
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,233
The whole premise he was exploring here is that the energy of a 

207
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:55,690
particle might have to do with something that oscillates over time, 

208
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,181
since this was known to be the case for photons, 

209
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,739
and these oscillating weights are meant to be a metaphor for whatever 

210
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,960
that something might be.

211
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,786
With Einstein's relatively new theory of relativity in mind, 

212
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,886
he pointed out that if you view this whole setup while moving relative to it, 

213
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:14,040
all of the weights are going to appear to fall out of phase.

214
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,400
That's not obvious, and I'm certainly exaggerating the effect in this animation.

215
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,722
It has to do with a core fact from special relativity, 

216
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,596
that what you consider to be simultaneous events in one 

217
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:32,240
reference frame may not be simultaneous in a different reference frame.

218
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,243
So even though from one point of view, you might see two of these weights as 

219
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:40,995
reaching their peaks and valleys at the same instant, 

220
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:45,071
from a different moving point of view, those events might actually be happening 

221
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,040
at different times.

222
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,941
Understanding this more fully requires some knowledge of special relativity, 

223
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:56,500
so we'll all just have to wait for Henry Reich's series on that topic to come out.

224
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,144
Right here our only goal is to get an inkling for why momentum, 

225
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,949
that thing we usually think of as mass times velocity, 

226
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,500
should have anything to do with spatial frequency.

227
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,551
And the basic line of reasoning here is if mass is the same as energy, 

228
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:15,298
via E equals mc squared, and if that energy was carried as some kind of oscillating 

229
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:20,101
phenomenon, similar to how it is for photons, then this sort of relativistic Doppler 

230
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:24,734
effect means changes to how that mass moves corresponds to changes in the spatial 

231
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:25,300
frequency.

232
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,980
So what does our general Fourier tradeoff tell us in this case?

233
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,087
Well if a particle is described as a little wave packet over space, 

234
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:40,491
then the Fourier transform, where we're thinking of this as a function over space, 

235
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:45,160
not over time, tells us how much various pure frequencies correspond with this top wave.

236
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,039
So if the momentum is the spatial frequency, up to a constant multiple, 

237
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,854
then the momentum is also a kind of wave, namely some multiple 

238
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,640
of the Fourier transform of the original wave.

239
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,729
So if that wave was very concentrated around a single point, 

240
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:11,351
as we have seen multiple times now, that means that its Fourier transform must 

241
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:16,207
necessarily be more spread out, and hence the wave describing its momentum must be 

242
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,080
more spread out, and vice versa.

243
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Notice unlike the Doppler radar case, where the ambiguity arose because 

244
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,788
waves were being used to measure an object with a definite distance and speed, 

245
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:33,900
what we're seeing here is that the particle is the wave.

246
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,341
So the spread out over space and over momentum is not some artifact 

247
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:43,182
of imperfect measurement techniques, it's a spread fundamental to what the particle is, 

248
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:46,593
analogous to how a musical note being spread out over time is 

249
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:49,620
fundamental to what it even means to be a musical note.

250
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,678
One pet peeve I have in mainstream references to quantum is that they often treat 

251
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:58,703
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as some fundamental example of things being 

252
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:02,626
unknowable in the quantum realm, as if it is a core nugget of the universe's 

253
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,340
indeterminacy.

254
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,278
But really it's just a trade-off between how concentrated a 

255
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,596
wave and its frequency representation can be applied to the 

256
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:14,080
premise that matter is some kind of wave, and hence spread out.

257
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,901
All of the stuff about randomness and unknowability is still there, 

258
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:22,000
but it comes one level deeper in the way that these waves have come to be interpreted.

259
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,078
You see, when you measure these particles, say trying to detect if it's in a given 

260
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:30,888
region, whether or not you find it there appears to be probabilistic, 

261
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:35,406
where the probability of finding it is proportional to the strength of the wave in 

262
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:36,060
that region.

263
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,069
So when one of these waves is concentrated near a point, 

264
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:43,516
what that actually means is that we have a higher probability 

265
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:47,520
of finding it near that point, that we are more certain of its location.

266
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,806
And just to beat this drum one more time, since that concentration implies 

267
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:55,533
a more spread out Fourier transform, then the wave describing its momentum 

268
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:59,111
would also be more spread out, so you wouldn't be able to find a narrow 

269
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:02,640
range of momenta that the particle has a high probability of occupying.

270
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,326
I quite like how if you look at the German word for this principle, 

271
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,573
it might be more directly translated as the unsharpness relation, 

272
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:14,608
which I think more faithfully captures the Fourier trade-off at play here without 

273
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,380
imposing on questions of no ability.

274
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,337
When I think of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, 

275
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:22,859
what makes it fascinating is not so much that it's a statement about randomness.

276
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,338
I mean, yes, that randomness is very thought-provoking and contentious and just plain 

277
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:33,260
weird, but to me equally fascinating is that underpinning Heisenberg's conclusion is 

278
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,775
that position and momentum have the same relationship as sound and frequency, 

279
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:42,812
as if a particle's momentum is somehow the sheet music describing how it moves through 

280
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,160
space.

281
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:43,160
.
