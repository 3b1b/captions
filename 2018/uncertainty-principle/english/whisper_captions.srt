1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
You've probably heard of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics,

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,520
that the more you know about a particle's position, the less certain you can be of its

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,840
momentum and vice versa.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,020
Michael here is for you to come away from this video feeling like this is utterly reasonable.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,020
It'll take some time, but I think you'll agree that digging deep is well worth it.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,800
You see, the uncertainty principle is actually one specific example of a much more general

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,480
trade-off that shows up in a lot of everyday totally non-quantum circumstances involving

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,920
waves.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,340
The plan here is to see what this means in the context of sound waves, which should feel

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,600
reasonable, and then Doppler radar, which should again feel reasonable and a little

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,920
bit closer to the quantum case, and then for particles, which if you're willing to accept

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,940
one or two premises of quantum mechanics, hopefully feels just as reasonable as the

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,460
first two.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,780
The core idea here has to do with the interplay between frequency and duration, and I bet

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,580
you already have an intuitive idea of this principle before we even get into the math

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,360
or the quantum.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,900
If you were to pull up behind a car at a red light, and your turn signals were flashing

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,100
together for a few seconds, you might kind of think they have the same frequency, but

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,340
at that point for all you know they could fall out of sync as more time passes, revealing

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,320
that they actually had different frequencies.

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,460
So an observation over a short period of time gave you low confidence over what their frequencies

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,780
are.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,720
But, if you were to set it at that red light for a full minute, and the signals continued

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,880
to click in sync, you would be a lot more confident that the frequencies are actually

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,260
the same.

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,720
So that certainty about the frequency information required an observation spread out over time.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,580
And this trade-off right here, between how short your observation can be and how confident

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,080
you can feel about the frequency, is an example of the general uncertainty principle.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,580
Similarly, think of a musical note.

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,020
The shorter it lasts in time, the less certain you can be about what its exact frequency

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,460
is.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,400
In the extreme, I could ask you what the pitch of a clap or shockwave is, and even someone

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,280
with perfect pitch would be unable to answer.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,840
And on the flip side, a more definite frequency requires a longer duration signal.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,560
Or rather than talking about definiteness or certainty, it would be a little more accurate

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,600
here to say that the short signal correlates highly with a wider range of frequency, and

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,020
that the signal correlating strongly with only a narrow range of frequencies must last

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,320
for a longer time.

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,500
Here, that's the kind of phrase that's made a little clearer when we bring in the

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,760
actual math, so let's turn now to talking about the Fourier transform, which is the

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,880
relevant construct for analyzing frequencies.

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,880
The last video I put out was a visual intuition for this transform, and yes, it probably would

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,700
be helpful if you've seen it, but I'm going to give a quick recap here to remind

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,780
ourselves how it went.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,020
Let's say you have a signal and it plays 5 beats per second over the course of 2 seconds.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,860
The Fourier transform gives a way to view any signal not in terms of the intensity at

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,280
each point in time, but instead in terms of the strength of various frequencies within

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,740
it.

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,400
The main idea was to take this signal and kind of wind it around a circle, as in, imagine

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,380
some rotating vector whose length is determined by the height of the graph at each point in

51
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,860
time.

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,880
Right now, this little vector is rotating at 0.3 cycles per second, that's the frequency

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,140
with which we're winding the graph around the circle.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,500
And for most frequencies, the signal is kind of just averaged out over the circle.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,200
This was the fun part of last video, don't you think?

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,640
Just seeing the different patterns that come up as you wind a pure cosine around a circle

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,500
like this.

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,080
But the key point is what happens when that winding frequency matches the signal frequency,

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,240
in this case 5 cycles per second.

60
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,400
As our little vector is rotating around and it draws, all of the peaks line up on one

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,180
side and all of the valleys on another side, so the whole weight of the graph is kind of

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,500
off-center, so to speak.

63
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,840
The idea behind the Fourier transform is that if you follow the center of mass of the wound-up

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,680
graph with frequency f, the position of that center of mass encodes the strength of that

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,600
frequency in the original signal.

66
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,020
The distance between that center of mass and the origin captures the strength of that frequency,

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,340
and this is something I didn't really talk about in the main video, but the angle of

68
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,520
that center of mass off the horizontal corresponds to the phase of the given frequency.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,200
One way to think of this whole winding mechanism is that it's a way to measure how well your

70
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,860
signal correlates with a given pure frequency.

71
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,560
So remember, when we say the Fourier transform, we're referring to this new function whose

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,200
input is that winding frequency, and whose output is the center of mass, thought of as

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,280
a complex number.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,940
Or more technically, it's a certain multiple of that center of mass, but whatever, the

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,300
overall shape remains the same.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,840
And the graph I'm drawing is just going to be the x-coordinate of that center of mass,

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,320
the real part of its output.

78
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,040
If you wanted, you could also plot the distance between the center of mass and the origin,

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,040
and maybe that better conveys how strongly each possible frequency correlates with a

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,340
signal.

81
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,400
The downside is that you lose some of the nice linearity properties I talked about last

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,740
video.

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,180
Anyway, point is, this spike above the winding frequency of 5 is the Fourier transform's

84
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,140
way of telling us that the dominant frequency of the signal is 5 beats per second.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,040
And equally importantly, the fact that it's a little bit spread out around that 5 is an

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,520
indication that pure sine waves near 5 beats per second also correlate pretty well with

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,020
the signal.

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,820
And that last idea is key for the uncertainty principle.

89
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,280
What I want you to do is think about how this spread changes as the signal persists longer

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,980
or shorter over time.

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,000
You've already seen this at an intuitive level, all we're doing right now is just

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,460
illustrating it in the language of Fourier transforms.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,020
If the signal persists over a long period of time, then when the winding frequency is

94
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,340
even slightly different from 5, the signal goes on long enough to wrap itself around

95
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,840
the circle and balance out.

96
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,980
So looking at the Fourier plot over here, that corresponds to a super sharp drop-off

97
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,660
in the magnitude of the transform as your frequency shifts away from that 5 beats per

98
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,040
second.

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,380
On the other hand, if your signal was really localized to a short period of time, then

100
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,400
as you adjust the frequency away from 5 beats per second, the signal doesn't really have

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,220
as much time to balance itself out around the circle.

102
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,000
You have to change the winding frequency to be meaningfully different from 5 before that

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,460
signal starts to balance out again.

104
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,300
Over on the frequency plot, that corresponds to a much broader peak around the 5 beats

105
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,980
per second.

106
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,340
And that's the uncertainty principle, just phrased a little bit more mathematically.

107
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,100
A signal concentrated in time must have a spread out Fourier transform, meaning it correlates

108
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,080
with a wide range of frequencies, and a signal with a concentrated Fourier transform has

109
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
to be spread out in time.

110
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,220
And one other place where this comes up in a really tangible way is Doppler radar.

111
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,140
With radar, you send out a radio wave pulse, and the pulse might reflect off of objects,

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,280
and the time it takes for this echo signal to return to you lets you deduce how far away

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,320
those objects are.

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,500
You can take this one step further and make deductions about the velocities of those objects

115
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
using the Doppler effect.

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,220
Think about sending out a pulse with some frequency.

117
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,040
If this gets reflected off an object moving towards you, then the beats of that wave get

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,500
kind of smushed together, so the echo you hear back is going to be a slightly higher

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,080
frequency.

120
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,960
Fourier transforms give a neat way to view this.

121
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,620
The Fourier transform of your original signal tells you the frequencies that go into it,

122
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,680
and for simplicity let's think of that as being dominated by a single pure frequency,

123
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,600
though as you know if it's a short pulse that means that our Fourier transform has

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,980
to be spread out a little bit.

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,320
And now think about the Doppler shifted echo.

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,800
By coming back at a higher frequency, it means that the Fourier transform will look like

127
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,060
a similar plot shifted up a bit.

128
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,220
Moreover, if you look at the size of that shift, you can deduce how quickly the object

129
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,720
was moving.

130
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,420
By the way, there is an important technical point that I'm choosing to gloss over here,

131
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,520
and I've outlined it a little more in the video description.

132
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,360
What follows is meant to be a distilled, if somewhat oversimplified description of the

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,860
Fourier tradeoff in this setup.

134
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,720
This salient fact is that time and frequency of that echo signal correspond respectively

135
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,860
to the position and velocity of the object being measured, which is what makes this example

136
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,160
much more closely analogous to the quantum mechanical Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

137
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,740
You see, there is a very real way in which a radar operator faces a dilemma, where the

138
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,540
more certain you can be about the positions of things, the less certain you are about

139
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,280
their velocities.

140
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,880
Here, imagine sending out a pulse that persists over a long period of time.

141
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,040
Then that means the echo from some object is also spread out over time.

142
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,580
And on its own, that might not seem like an issue.

143
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,120
But in practice, there's all sorts of different objects in the field, so these echoes are

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,500
all going to start to get overlapped with each other.

145
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,240
Combine that with other noise and imperfections, and this can make the locations of multiple

146
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,980
objects extremely ambiguous.

147
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,460
Instead, a more precise understanding of how far away all these things are would require

148
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,120
having a very quick little pulse confined to a small amount of time.

149
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,640
But think about the frequency representations of such a short echo.

150
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,820
As you saw with the sound example, the Fourier transform of a quick pulse is necessarily

151
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,980
more spread out.

152
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,280
So for many objects with various velocities, that would mean that the Doppler shifted echoes,

153
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,300
despite having been nicely separated in time, are more likely to overlap in frequency space.

154
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,980
So since what you're looking at is the sum of all of these, it can be really ambiguous

155
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,000
how you break it down.

156
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,100
If you wanted a nice clean sharp view of the velocities, you would need to have an echo

157
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,460
that only occupies a very small amount of frequency space.

158
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,640
But for a signal to be concentrated in frequency space, it necessarily has to be spread out

159
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,120
in time.

160
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,940
This is the Fourier tradeoff.

161
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,800
You cannot have crisp delineation for both.

162
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,100
And this brings us to the quantum case.

163
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,540
Do you know who else spent some time immersed in the pragmatic world of radio wave transmissions?

164
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,980
A young, otherwise philosophically inclined history major in WWI France, Louis de Broglie.

165
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,520
And this was a strangely fitting post, given his predispositions to philosophizing about

166
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,480
the nature of waves.

167
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,600
After the war, as de Broglie switched from the humanities to physics, in his 1924 PhD

168
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,240
thesis he proposed that all matter has wave-like properties.

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
And more than that, he concluded that the momentum of any moving particle is proportional

170
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,800
to the spatial frequency of that wave, how many times that wave cycles per unit distance.

171
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,660
Ok, now that's the kind of phrase that can easily fly into one ear and out the other.

172
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,260
As soon as you say matter is a wave, it's easy to throw up your hands and say physics

173
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,000
is just weird.

174
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,920
But really, think about this.

175
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,560
Even if you're willing to grant that particles behave like waves, in some way, whatever that

176
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,520
means, why on earth should the momentum of those particles, the thing we classically

177
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,900
think of as mass times velocity, have anything to do with the spatial frequency of that wave?

178
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,560
Now being more of a math than a physics guy, I asked a number of people with deeper backgrounds

179
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,740
in physics about helpful intuitions here, and one thing that became clear is that there

180
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,700
is a surprising variety of viewpoints.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,520
Now personally, one thing I found to be interesting was just going back to the source and seeing

182
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,240
how de Broglie framed things in his seminal paper on the topic.

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,860
You see, there is a sense in which it's not all that different from the Doppler effect,

184
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,060
where relative movement corresponds to shifts in frequency.

185
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,440
It has a slightly different flavor, since we're not talking about frequency over time,

186
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,480
instead we're talking about frequency over space, and special relativity is going to

187
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,460
come into play, but I still think it's an interesting analogy.

188
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,060
In his thesis, de Broglie lays out what is, in his own words, a crude comparison for the

189
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,100
kind of wave phenomenon he has in mind.

190
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,520
Imagine many weights hanging from springs, with all of these weights oscillating up and

191
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,900
down in sync, and with most of the mass concentrated towards a single point.

192
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,560
The energy of these oscillating weights is meant to be a metaphor for the energy of a

193
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,300
particle, specifically the E equals mc squared style energy residing in its mass, and de

194
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,100
Broglie emphasized how the conception he had in mind involves the particle being dispersed

195
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,280
across all of space.

196
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,320
The whole premise he was exploring here is that the energy of a particle might have to

197
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,200
do with something that oscillates over time, since this was known to be the case for photons,

198
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,260
and these oscillating weights are meant to be a metaphor for whatever that something

199
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,960
might be.

200
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,280
With Einstein's relatively new theory of relativity in mind, he pointed out that if you view this

201
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,240
whole setup while moving relative to it, all of the weights are going to appear to fall

202
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,040
out of phase.

203
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,400
That's not obvious, and I'm certainly exaggerating the effect in this animation.

204
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,740
It has to do with a core fact from special relativity, that what you consider to be simultaneous

205
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,240
events in one reference frame may not be simultaneous in a different reference frame.

206
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,800
So even though from one point of view, you might see two of these weights as reaching

207
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,220
their peaks and valleys at the same instant, from a different moving point of view, those

208
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,040
events might actually be happening at different times.

209
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,220
Understanding this more fully requires some knowledge of special relativity, so we'll

210
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,500
all just have to wait for Henry Reich's series on that topic to come out.

211
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,200
Right here our only goal is to get an inkling for why momentum, that thing we usually think

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,500
of as mass times velocity, should have anything to do with spatial frequency.

213
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,100
And the basic line of reasoning here is if mass is the same as energy, via E equals mc

214
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,360
squared, and if that energy was carried as some kind of oscillating phenomenon, similar

215
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,520
to how it is for photons, then this sort of relativistic Doppler effect means changes

216
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,300
to how that mass moves corresponds to changes in the spatial frequency.

217
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,980
So what does our general Fourier tradeoff tell us in this case?

218
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Well if a particle is described as a little wave packet over space, then the Fourier transform,

219
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,940
where we're thinking of this as a function over space, not over time, tells us how much

220
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,160
various pure frequencies correspond with this top wave.

221
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,020
So if the momentum is the spatial frequency, up to a constant multiple, then the momentum

222
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,640
is also a kind of wave, namely some multiple of the Fourier transform of the original wave.

223
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,980
So if that wave was very concentrated around a single point, as we have seen multiple times

224
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,260
now, that means that its Fourier transform must necessarily be more spread out, and hence

225
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,080
the wave describing its momentum must be more spread out, and vice versa.

226
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,260
Notice unlike the Doppler radar case, where the ambiguity arose because waves were being

227
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,580
used to measure an object with a definite distance and speed, what we're seeing here

228
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,900
is that the particle is the wave.

229
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,460
So the spread out over space and over momentum is not some artifact of imperfect measurement

230
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,620
techniques, it's a spread fundamental to what the particle is, analogous to how a musical

231
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,620
note being spread out over time is fundamental to what it even means to be a musical note.

232
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,000
One pet peeve I have in mainstream references to quantum is that they often treat Heisenberg's

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,220
uncertainty principle as some fundamental example of things being unknowable in the

234
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,340
quantum realm, as if it is a core nugget of the universe's indeterminacy.

235
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,120
But really it's just a trade-off between how concentrated a wave and its frequency

236
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,320
representation can be applied to the premise that matter is some kind of wave, and hence

237
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
spread out.

238
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,300
All of the stuff about randomness and unknowability is still there, but it comes one level deeper

239
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,000
in the way that these waves have come to be interpreted.

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
You see, when you measure these particles, say trying to detect if it's in a given

241
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,860
region, whether or not you find it there appears to be probabilistic, where the probability

242
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,060
of finding it is proportional to the strength of the wave in that region.

243
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,520
So when one of these waves is concentrated near a point, what that actually means is

244
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,480
that we have a higher probability of finding it near that point, that we are more certain

245
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,520
of its location.

246
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,380
And just to beat this drum one more time, since that concentration implies a more spread

247
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,260
out Fourier transform, then the wave describing its momentum would also be more spread out,

248
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,400
so you wouldn't be able to find a narrow range of momenta that the particle has a high

249
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,640
probability of occupying.

250
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,360
I quite like how if you look at the German word for this principle, it might be more

251
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,920
directly translated as the unsharpness relation, which I think more faithfully captures the

252
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,380
Fourier trade-off at play here without imposing on questions of no ability.

253
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,780
When I think of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, what makes it fascinating is not

254
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,860
so much that it's a statement about randomness.

255
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,420
I mean, yes, that randomness is very thought-provoking and contentious and just plain weird, but to

256
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,460
me equally fascinating is that underpinning Heisenberg's conclusion is that position

257
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,260
and momentum have the same relationship as sound and frequency, as if a particle's

258
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,160
momentum is somehow the sheet music describing how it moves through space.

259
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,840
.
