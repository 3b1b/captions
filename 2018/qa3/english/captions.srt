1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
What is a Grobner Basis?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,573
If that is your intent for what this Q&A episode is going to be, 

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,619
as far as technicality and deep explanation is concerned, 

4
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,720
you're going to be grossly disappointed.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,575
Same goes to whoever asked about what the Fourier 

6
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:15,480
Transform has to do with quantum computing.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,124
I can say at a high level it's because the Fourier Transform gives 

8
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,311
you a unitary operation, and quantum computing is very fast when 

9
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:25,400
it comes to anything that can be expressed as a unitary matrix.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,764
But those words won't make sense if you don't already know what it means, 

11
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:32,092
and this is not at all meant to be a video that's going to go into some deep math 

12
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:32,580
explanation.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,760
But when I do cover quantum computing, which I will at some point...

14
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:43,720
What would you do professionally if it weren't 

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,800
for YouTube slash what are you doing professionally?

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,000
So a lot of you might know I used to work for Khan Academy, 

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,746
and I think if I wasn't doing this, I would definitely seek out some other way of 

18
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:53,980
doing math outreach online.

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,052
The intent of the question is maybe more what 

20
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,440
would I do that has nothing to do with math outreach.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,620
I spent a lot of time doing random software engineering things through college.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,006
Like my summer internships were often spent at a tech company, 

23
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,240
rather than doing something explicitly math related.

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,240
But if I really turn on that parallel universe machine, 

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,920
I think going into data science was a very real possibility.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,537
One of the internships that I was doing, at the end of it they asked if I wanted to, 

27
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:23,774
instead of going to college again, just stick around and maybe have a full-time job, 

28
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:25,420
and just see what unfolded there.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,480
And I seriously considered it, you know, it's pretty compelling.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,600
Ultimately the love for pure math won out, so 

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,080
I did go back to school as you're supposed to.

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,375
But I kind of do wonder what would have been if 

33
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,580
instead I went that professional data science route.

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,380
How arbitrary do you think our mathematical perspective is as humans on Earth?

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,066
If an alien civilization developed math from scratch, 

36
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:49,600
do you think we would see clearer similarities in their development of the fields?

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,540
Like number theory, trigonometry, and calculus.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,150
So this is an interesting question because it cuts 

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,240
right to the heart of is math invented or discovered?

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,711
And I like the phrasing where you kind of imagine an 

41
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,080
alien civilization coming and comparing your math to theirs.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,160
It's hard to speculate on this, right?

43
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,380
Like I have no idea.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,877
Some aliens came, we have no way of knowing whether 

45
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,280
their math would look completely different from ours.

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,282
One thing you can be pretty sure of, and this might seem superficial, 

47
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,860
is that the notation would be entirely different, right?

48
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,440
There's a lot of arbitrary choices in how we write things down.

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,040
Newton's notation for calculus versus Leibniz notation for calculus.

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,600
You know, a lot of the really silly things we have, 

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
like which side of the variable the function goes on.

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,980
Writing out the letters s-i-n for sine, cosine.

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,060
I had the whole triangle of power video about notations for radicals and exponentials.

54
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,072
And on the one hand that might not feel substantive, 

55
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:41,079
but I think it's really interesting to contemplate other ways where the notation shapes 

56
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,994
the way that we think about it and shapes the axioms and theorems we even choose more 

57
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,360
so than we give it credit for.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,480
So a project I'm actively working on right now is about quaternions.

59
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,783
And I was a little bit surprised to learn how up in the air the potential 

60
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:57,140
notations and conventions for teaching students about vectors was.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,871
Like a lot of the actual notation and terminology we have for vectors and cross 

62
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,300
products dot products the way we think of them in 3D ultimately stems from quaternions.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,158
You know, even the fact that we use i, j, and k as letters to represent the x, 

64
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:11,100
y, and z directions.

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,250
And if Hamilton had had his way, we would still teach engineering students primarily 

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,678
about quaternions and then things like the dot product and cross product would be 

67
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:25,160
viewed as subsets of what the quaternions do and what quaternion multiplication is.

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,837
And I think there's a compelling case to be made for the fact that 

69
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,900
we would use that if we could visualize four dimensions better.

70
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,310
But the reason that quaternions never really won out as the notation du 

71
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,720
jour is because they're confusing because no one really understood them.

72
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,060
There's all sorts of hilarious quotes from Lord Kelvin and the like about how quaternions 

73
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,400
are just needlessly confuddling when you're trying to phrase some fact about the universe.

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,007
Like Maxwell's equations were originally written much 

75
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,380
more quaternionically than we teach them to students now.

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,399
And arguably they're much more elegant that way, 

77
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,880
but it's confusing because we can't visualize it.

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,439
So I think if you had some alien civilization that came but they had a very 

79
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,933
good spatial conception for four dimensions, they would look at our vector 

80
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:08,380
notation and think that it was not capturing the deeper realities of math.

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,780
Arguably, who knows?

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,200
What do you think is the main thing that drives people away from math?

83
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,009
Always hard to answer on these kind of things, 

84
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,978
but I really suspect that as soon as you wrap something in a certain kind of judgment 

85
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,809
of there's a notion of being correct or incorrect or an implicit statement there's 

86
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,240
a notion of being good at math.

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,540
Some people are math people, some people aren't math people.

88
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,303
As soon as you get someone identifying that they're not a math person, 

89
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:34,707
first you know insinuating that that even makes sense and then insinuating 

90
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,840
that they fall into that, like of course you're not going to like it.

91
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,492
Of course your natural mind churnings aren't going to go in 

92
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,005
the direction of some puzzle because you'd much rather think 

93
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,560
about things that you're good at and that make you feel happy.

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,723
All of the latest stuff about growth mindsets and 

95
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,380
Carol DeWack and Joe Bowler are really behind that.

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,122
You know, the idea that if you're trying to tell a student something about how 

97
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:59,000
they're doing with math rather than framing it around, oh you must be so smart, right?

98
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,248
Frame it around, oh you must have worked very 

99
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,540
hard or you must have put a lot of time into that.

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,460
There's a lot of much less judgmental things that we have out there, like reading.

101
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,486
Even though there's some notions of reading comprehension tests for 

102
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,478
students in school and you know you're reading at an eighth grade level, 

103
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,060
people usually aren't like, oh I'm not a reading person, right?

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,107
Like I, those words like some people that just make sense to 

105
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:23,080
them but for me those letters I don't know how they come together.

106
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,764
When it comes to contest math like the AMC, I think those 

107
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:30,080
can be really good for high schoolers as a bank of problems.

108
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,110
I think they can be really bad for high schoolers as an insinuation of there's 

109
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,520
some like top-tier math folk and they can do these problems really quickly.

110
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,743
But if you give the same questions to the student and you say 

111
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:44,032
rather than being forced to go through all of these in 75 minutes, 

112
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,880
you say let's spend 30 minutes on just one of them, right?

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
Really delving into it.

114
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,634
They're really solid problems that kind of engage in the spirit 

115
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,979
of problem solving and you know removing that judgmental aspect, 

116
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,480
removing that time aspect, I think you know that can help out a lot.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,684
A lot of people ask about certain things that I've 

118
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,580
made promises for but haven't necessarily delivered on.

119
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,141
In a recent video, you know, I did one on divergence and curl 

120
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,190
and I mentioned at the end an example of using complex numbers 

121
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,240
to model fluid flow and a certain model for flow around a wing.

122
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,110
And you might notice I have yet to actually put out a video on that and I've 

123
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,520
certainly seen a number of commenters you know hampering on me for that fact.

124
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,818
If there's ever a thing that I promise and then I don't make a video on it, 

125
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,206
it's probably because I spent a good amount of time trying to write a 

126
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,740
script for it that I just didn't feel was compelling for whatever reason.

127
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,328
And I think maybe the granddaddy here is the probability series, 

128
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:40,599
which at the moment I have five videos that I've made that are you know released 

129
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,180
to patrons.

130
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,960
I don't, I just don't feel great about them and I kind of want the stuff 

131
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,007
that I put out to you guys to be something I feel is you know if not original, 

132
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:53,440
something that wouldn't be out there otherwise from other creators.

133
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,060
And there's a lot of good probability material online.

134
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,831
I will probably do something to release the material that I have, 

135
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:03,656
either just as it is but on some second channel with the acknowledgement, 

136
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,343
hey this isn't the greatest work I think I've done, 

137
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,980
or trying to rework them and make them standalones.

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,567
But as far as you know essence of blank content, 

139
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:14,870
I feel much clearer about how I would want to extend the linear algebra 

140
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,172
series rather than spinning my wheels on certain scripts and animations 

141
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,521
that I ultimately don't think are going to deliver something to you guys 

142
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,760
that I would feel proud of.

143
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,260
Do you have any questions, Jabril?

144
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm just reading from some Reddit ones here but we do something live.

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,883
How much compromise if any do you have to give with like what 

146
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:37,620
you can animate versus like what your script is trying to convey?

147
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,155
Usually if I can't animate a thing, and it's a mathematical thing, 

148
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:43,434
it's not like a frivolous cartoonish type thing, 

149
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,550
I change the tool so that it can animate that thing right and then 

150
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,760
that might take more time.

151
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,884
And it's possible that subconsciously that means I resist 

152
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,440
topics that I know would be more difficult to animate.

153
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,250
I don't think that happens, I like to use that to encourage creation of new things right, 

154
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,137
like on the divergence curl didn't have good fluid flow stuff 

155
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,000
but it was fun to play around with that.

156
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,003
For quaternions right now I think there's a lot of 3D related things that 

157
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:11,901
I wanted to sort of upgrade because the previous way I was doing a lot 

158
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:15,800
of 3D animations was clunky and not as extensible as I wanted it to be.

159
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,400
So usually that is a good excuse to just improve the graphics tool.

160
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,740
We have somewhere a question on here, what sort of music do you listen to?

161
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,420
Which I mostly wanted to answer to like mention my renewed love for the Punch Brothers.

162
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,983
I don't know if any of you know about them, they're actually super weird, 

163
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,380
they're like a avant-garde bluegrass band.

164
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,176
It's just five geniuses who get together and put out phenomenal art, 

165
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,679
so can't complain about that.

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,240
How do you compare making your videos to making videos for Khan Academy?

167
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,748
So very different processes right, like Khan Academy you imagine 

168
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:52,640
sitting next to someone and tutoring them and just explaining it, 

169
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,620
you're writing everything by hand, for the most part you do it live.

170
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,900
On this channel I obviously script things, I put 

171
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,280
a lot of time into creating the visuals for it.

172
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,206
Sometimes in a way that makes me feel you know if at Khan 

173
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:06,653
Academy I could sit down and make like three videos in an 

174
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:09,480
afternoon and here it's taking me like three weeks to do one video.

175
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,920
Which of these actually carries more of an impact?

176
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,720
I think there's a proper balance for both of them and I think there's a lot of people 

177
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
out there who do the Khan style stuff to include Khan Academy but also many others.

178
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,760
The way I like to think about things is what wouldn't happen if I wasn't doing it?

179
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,752
But there is that little part of me that thinks maybe I should start some 

180
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:32,199
sort of second channel of the super cheap, just like me and a notebook 

181
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,840
and a pencil like scrapping through some sort of explanation super quickly.

182
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,800
Who makes the awesome music playing in your videos?

183
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,920
Vince Rubenetti.

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,283
Link in the description, link in all of the descriptions actually, 

185
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,251
he does really good work and just go you know download some of the music 

186
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,260
and leave him a little tip if you feel like it's something that you enjoy.

187
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,620
What is your favorite Palomino?

188
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,960
Palomino?

189
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,560
Palimano?

190
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,160
This one.

191
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,740
I'll figure it out later and insert it on the screen.

192
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,200
All right folks, thanks for watching, stick around for whenever the next upload is.

193
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,520
It's going to be on Quaternions and I hope you like it.

194
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:15,420
This is your close-up and this is your wide.
