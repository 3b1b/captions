1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is a Grobner Basis?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,680
If that is your intent for what this Q&A episode is going to be,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,120
as far as technicality and deep explanation is concerned,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,200
you're going to be grossly disappointed.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,760
Same goes to whoever asked about what the Fourier Transform has to do with quantum computing.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,560
I can say at a high level it's because the Fourier Transform gives you a unitary operation,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,600
and quantum computing is very fast when it comes to anything that can be expressed as a unitary matrix.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,080
But those words won't make sense if you don't already know what it means,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
and this is not at all meant to be a video that's going to go into some deep math explanation.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,760
But when I do cover quantum computing, which I will at some point...

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,080
What would you do professionally if it weren't for YouTube slash what are you doing professionally?

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,080
So a lot of you might know I used to work for Khan Academy, and I think if I wasn't doing this,

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,400
I would definitely seek out some other way of doing math outreach online.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,720
The intent of the question is maybe more what would I do that has nothing to do with math outreach.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,000
I spent a lot of time doing random software engineering things through college.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
Like my summer internships were often spent at a tech company,

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
rather than doing something explicitly math related.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,400
But if I really turn on that parallel universe machine,

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
I think going into data science was a very real possibility.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
One of the internships that I was doing, at the end of it they asked if I wanted to,

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
instead of going to college again, just stick around and maybe have a full-time job,

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
and just see what unfolded there.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,960
And I seriously considered it, you know, it's pretty compelling.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,240
Ultimately the love for pure math won out, so I did go back to school as you're supposed to.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,560
But I kind of do wonder what would have been if instead I went that professional data science route.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
How arbitrary do you think our mathematical perspective is as humans on Earth?

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,400
If an alien civilization developed math from scratch,

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,520
do you think we would see clearer similarities in their development of the fields,

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
like number theory, trigonometry, and calculus?

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,720
So this is an interesting question because it cuts right to the heart of

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,400
is math invented or discovered?

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,520
And I like the phrasing where you kind of imagine an alien civilization coming

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,040
and comparing your math to theirs.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
It's hard to speculate on this, right?

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Like, I have no idea.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,200
Some aliens came, we have no way of knowing whether their math would look completely different from ours.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
One thing you can be pretty sure of, and this might seem superficial,

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,760
is that the notation would be entirely different, right?

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
There's a lot of arbitrary choices in how we write things down.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Newton's notation for calculus versus Leibniz notation for calculus.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,240
You know, a lot of the really silly things we have,

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,480
like which side of the variable the function goes on,

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,920
writing out the letters s-i-n for sine, cosine.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
I had the whole Triangle of Power video about notations for radicals and exponentials.

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
And on the one hand that might not feel substantive,

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,080
but I think it's really interesting to contemplate other ways where

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
the notation shapes the way that we think about it

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,640
and shapes the axioms and theorems we even choose more so than we give it credit for.

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
So a project I'm actively working on right now is about quaternions.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
And I was a little bit surprised to learn how up in the air

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,040
the potential notations and conventions for teaching students about vectors was.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,520
Like a lot of the actual notation and terminology we have for vectors

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,560
and cross products dot products the way we think of them in 3D

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
ultimately stems from quaternions.

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,120
You know, even the fact that we use i, j, and k as letters to represent the x, y, and z directions.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,720
And if Hamilton had had his way,

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,320
we would still teach engineering students primarily about quaternions

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,680
and then things like the dot product and cross product would be viewed as

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
subsets of what the quaternions do and what quaternion multiplication is.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
And I think there's a compelling case to be made for the fact that

61
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
we would use that if we could visualize four dimensions better.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
But the reason that quaternions never really won out as the notation de jure

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
is because they're confusing because no one really understood them.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,520
There's all sorts of hilarious quotes from Lord Kelvin and the like

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,880
about how quaternions are just needlessly confuddling

66
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,440
when you're trying to phrase some fact about the universe.

67
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,800
Like Maxwell's equations were originally written much more quaternionically

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,720
than we teach them to students now.

69
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,600
And arguably they're much more elegant that way,

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,760
but it's confusing because we can't visualize it.

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
So I think if you had some alien civilization that came

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,600
but they had a very good spatial conception for four dimensions,

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,240
they would look at our vector notation and think that it was

74
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,640
not capturing the deeper realities of math.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,160
Arguably. Who knows?

76
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,600
What do you think is the main thing that drives people away from math?

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
Always hard to answer on these kind of things,

78
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,240
but I really suspect that as soon as you wrap something in a certain kind of judgment

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,760
of there's a notion of being correct or incorrect or an implicit statement,

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
there's a notion of being good at math.

81
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,920
Some people are math people, some people aren't math people.

82
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,760
As soon as you get someone identifying that they're not a math person,

83
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,000
first, you know, insinuating that that even makes sense,

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,400
and then insinuating that they fall into that,

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,760
like, of course, you're not going to like it.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,240
Of course, your natural mind churnings aren't going to go in the direction of some puzzle

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,920
because you'd much rather think about things that you're good at and that make you feel happy.

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,400
All of the latest stuff about growth mindsets and Carol DeWack and Joe Bowler

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
really behind that, you know, the idea that if you're trying to tell a student something

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
about how they're doing with math, rather than framing it around,

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,440
oh, you must be so smart, right, frame it around,

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,520
oh, you must have worked very hard or you must have put a lot of time into that.

93
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,200
There's a lot of much less judgmental things that we have out there,

94
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,560
like reading.

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
Even though there's some notions of reading comprehension tests for students in school,

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
and you're reading at an eighth grade level,

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,040
people usually aren't like, oh, I'm not a reading person, right?

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,720
Like, those words, like some people, it just makes sense to them,

99
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,960
but for me, those letters, I don't know how they come together.

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
When it comes to contest math, like the AMC,

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,320
I think those can be really good for high schoolers as a bank of problems.

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,600
I think they can be really bad for high schoolers as an insinuation of

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,680
there's some like top-tier math folk and they can do these problems really quickly.

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
But if you give the same questions to the student and you say,

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
rather than being forced to go through all of these in 75 minutes,

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,160
you say, let's spend 30 minutes on just one of them, right, really delving into it.

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,240
They're really solid problems that kind of engage in the spirit of problem solving

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,920
and removing that judgmental aspect, removing that time aspect, I think,

109
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,720
you know, that can help out a lot.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,640
A lot of people ask about certain things that I've made promises for,

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
but haven't necessarily delivered on.

112
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,600
In a recent video, you know, I did one on divergence and curl,

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,320
and I mentioned at the end an example of using complex numbers to model fluid flow

114
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,640
and a certain model for flow around a wing.

115
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,360
And you might notice I have yet to actually put out a video on that,

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
and I've certainly seen a number of commenters, you know, hampering on me for that fact.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
If there's ever a thing that I promise and then I don't make a video on it,

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,760
it's probably because I spent a good amount of time trying to write a script for it

119
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,120
that I just didn't feel was compelling for whatever reason.

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,080
And I think maybe the granddaddy here is the probability series,

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,200
which at the moment I have five videos that I've made that are, you know, released to patrons.

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,640
I don't, I just don't feel great about them,

123
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,320
and I kind of want the stuff that I put out to you guys to be something I feel is,

124
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,760
you know, if not original, something that wouldn't be out there otherwise from other creators.

125
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,560
And there's a lot of good probability material online.

126
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,000
I will probably do something to release the material that I have,

127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,320
either just as it is but on some second channel with the acknowledgement,

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,640
hey this isn't the greatest work I think I've done,

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,120
or trying to rework them and make them standalones.

130
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,920
But as far as, you know, essence of blank content,

131
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,200
I feel much clearer about how I would want to extend the linear algebra series

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,280
rather than spinning my wheels on certain scripts and animations that I ultimately

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,960
don't think are going to deliver something to you guys that I would feel proud of.

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
Do you have any questions, Tabril?

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,220
Um...

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm just reading from, reading from some Reddit ones here, but we do something live.

137
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
How much compromise, if any, do you have to give with, like,

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,920
what you can animate versus like what your script is trying to convey?

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,440
Usually if I can't animate a thing, and it's a mathematical thing,

140
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
it's not like a frivolous cartoonish type thing,

141
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,400
I change the tool so that it can animate that thing, right?

142
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
And then that might take more time.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
And it's possible that subconsciously that means

144
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,920
I resist topics that I know would be more difficult to animate.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
I don't think that happens.

146
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,920
I like to use that to encourage creation of new things, right?

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,200
Like, um, on the Divergence Curl, didn't have good fluid flow stuff,

148
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,720
but it was fun to play around with that.

149
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,200
For Quaternions right now, I think there's a lot of 3D related things

150
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,440
that I wanted to sort of upgrade because the previous way I was doing a lot of 3D animations

151
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
was clunky and not as extensible as I wanted it to be.

152
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,360
So usually use that as a good excuse to just improve the graphics tool.

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
We have somewhere a question on here.

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
What sort of music do you listen to?

155
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
Which I mostly wanted to answer to, uh, like,

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
mention my renewed love for the Punch Brothers.

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,760
I don't know if any of you know about them.

158
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,800
They're actually super weird.

159
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,600
They're like a avant-garde bluegrass band.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,800
It's just five geniuses who get together and put out phenomenal art.

161
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
So can't complain about that.

162
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,640
How do you compare making your videos to making videos for Khan Academy?

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
So very different processes, right?

164
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,520
Like Khan Academy, you imagine sitting next to someone and tutoring them

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
and just explaining it.

166
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
You're writing everything by hand.

167
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
For the most part, you do it live.

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,480
On this channel, I obviously script things.

169
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,520
I put a lot of time into creating the visuals for it.

170
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,480
Sometimes in a way that makes me feel, you know, if at Khan Academy,

171
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
I could sit down and make like three videos in an afternoon.

172
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,680
And here it's taking me like three weeks to do one video.

173
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,840
You know, which of these actually carries more of an impact.

174
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
I think there's a proper balance for both of them.

175
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,320
And I think there's a lot of people out there who do the Khan style stuff

176
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,880
to include Khan Academy, but also many others.

177
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,960
The way I like to think about things is what wouldn't happen if I wasn't doing it.

178
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
But there is that little part of me that thinks maybe I should start

179
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
some sort of second channel of the super cheap,

180
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
just like me and a notebook and a pencil,

181
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
like scrapping through some sort of explanation super quickly.

182
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Who makes the awesome music playing in your videos?

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
Vince Rubenetti.

184
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,200
Link in the description.

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
Link in all of the descriptions, actually.

186
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,840
He does really good work.

187
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,680
And just go, you know, download some of the music and leave him a little tip

188
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
if you feel like it's something that you enjoy.

189
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
What is your favorite Palomino?

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,560
Palomino? Polymono?

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,100
This one.

192
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
I'll figure it out later and insert it on the screen.

193
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
All right, folks, thanks for watching.

194
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Stick around for whenever the next upload is.

195
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
It's going to be on Quaternions and I hope you like it.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
This is your close-up and this is your wide.

197
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,980
All right.

198
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,320
Does that probably mean I should be looking at the wide one?

199
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,680
Or do I do a dramatic like camera number two?
