1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
What is a Grobner Basis?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,520
If that is your intent for what this Q&A episode is going to be,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,760
as far as technicality and deep explanation is concerned,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,720
you're going to be grossly disappointed.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,480
Same goes to whoever asked about what the Fourier Transform has to do with quantum computing.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,480
I can say at a high level it's because the Fourier Transform gives you a unitary operation,

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,400
and quantum computing is very fast when it comes to anything that can be expressed as a unitary matrix.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,080
But those words won't make sense if you don't already know what it means,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,580
and this is not at all meant to be a video that's going to go into some deep math explanation.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,760
But when I do cover quantum computing, which I will at some point...

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,800
What would you do professionally if it weren't for YouTube slash what are you doing professionally?

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,140
So a lot of you might know I used to work for Khan Academy, and I think if I wasn't doing this,

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,980
I would definitely seek out some other way of doing math outreach online.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,440
The intent of the question is maybe more what would I do that has nothing to do with math outreach.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,620
I spent a lot of time doing random software engineering things through college.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,140
Like my summer internships were often spent at a tech company,

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,240
rather than doing something explicitly math related.

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,240
But if I really turn on that parallel universe machine,

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,920
I think going into data science was a very real possibility.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,940
One of the internships that I was doing, at the end of it they asked if I wanted to,

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,420
instead of going to college again, just stick around and maybe have a full-time job,

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,420
and just see what unfolded there.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,480
And I seriously considered it, you know, it's pretty compelling.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,080
Ultimately the love for pure math won out, so I did go back to school as you're supposed to.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,580
But I kind of do wonder what would have been if instead I went that professional data science route.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,380
How arbitrary do you think our mathematical perspective is as humans on Earth?

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,240
If an alien civilization developed math from scratch,

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
do you think we would see clearer similarities in their development of the fields?

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,540
Like number theory, trigonometry, and calculus.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,800
So this is an interesting question because it cuts right to the heart of

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,240
is math invented or discovered?

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,560
And I like the phrasing where you kind of imagine an alien civilization coming

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,080
and comparing your math to theirs.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,160
It's hard to speculate on this, right?

35
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,380
Like I have no idea.

36
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,280
Some aliens came, we have no way of knowing whether their math would look completely different from ours.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,960
One thing you can be pretty sure of, and this might seem superficial,

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,860
is that the notation would be entirely different, right?

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,440
There's a lot of arbitrary choices in how we write things down.

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,040
Newton's notation for calculus versus Leibniz notation for calculus.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,320
You know, a lot of the really silly things we have,

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,680
like which side of the variable the function goes on.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,980
Writing out the letters s-i-n for sine, cosine.

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,060
I had the whole triangle of power video about notations for radicals and exponentials.

45
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,580
And on the one hand that might not feel substantive,

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,860
but I think it's really interesting to contemplate other ways where

47
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,260
the notation shapes the way that we think about it

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,360
and shapes the axioms and theorems we even choose more so than we give it credit for.

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,480
So a project I'm actively working on right now is about quaternions.

50
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,080
And I was a little bit surprised to learn how up in the air the potential notations

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,140
and conventions for teaching students about vectors was.

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,980
Like a lot of the actual notation and terminology we have for vectors and

53
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,360
cross products dot products the way we think of them in 3D

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,300
ultimately stems from quaternions.

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,100
You know, even the fact that we use i, j, and k as letters to represent the x, y, and z directions.

56
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,940
And if Hamilton had had his way, we would still teach engineering students primarily

57
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,660
about quaternions and then things like the dot product and cross product would be viewed as

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,160
subsets of what the quaternions do and what quaternion multiplication is.

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,400
And I think there's a compelling case to be made for the fact that

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,900
we would use that if we could visualize four dimensions better.

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,080
But the reason that quaternions never really won out as the notation du jour

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
is because they're confusing because no one really understood them.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,540
There's all sorts of hilarious quotes from Lord Kelvin and the like about how

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,400
quaternions are just needlessly confuddling when you're trying to phrase some fact about the universe.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,380
Like Maxwell's equations were originally written much more quaternionically than we teach them to students now.

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,880
And arguably they're much more elegant that way, but it's confusing because we can't visualize it.

67
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,240
So I think if you had some alien civilization that came but they had a very good spatial conception for four dimensions,

68
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,380
they would look at our vector notation and think that it was not capturing the deeper realities of math.

69
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,200
Arguably, who knows? What do you think is the main thing that drives people away from math?

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,500
Always hard to answer on these kind of things, but I really suspect that as soon as you

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,420
wrap something in a certain kind of judgment of there's a notion of being correct or incorrect

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,240
or an implicit statement there's a notion of being good at math.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,540
Some people are math people, some people aren't math people.

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
As soon as you get someone identifying that they're not a math person,

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,300
first you know insinuating that that even makes sense and then insinuating that they fall into that,

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,560
like of course you're not going to like it. Of course your natural mind churnings aren't going

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,120
to go in the direction of some puzzle because you'd much rather think about things that you're

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,180
good at and that make you feel happy. All of the latest stuff about growth mindsets and Carol

79
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,820
DeWack and Joe Bowler are really behind that. You know, the idea that if you're trying to tell a

80
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,820
student something about how they're doing with math rather than framing it around, oh you must

81
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,040
be so smart, right? Frame it around, oh you must have worked very hard or you must have put a lot of

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,000
time into that. There's a lot of much less judgmental things that we have out there,

83
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,820
like reading. Even though there's some notions of reading comprehension tests for students in school

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,020
and you know you're reading at an eighth grade level, people usually aren't like, oh I'm not a

85
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,120
reading person, right? Like I, those words like some people that just make sense to them but for

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,160
me those letters I don't know how they come together. When it comes to contest math like

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,720
the AMC, I think those can be really good for high schoolers as a bank of problems. I think

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,380
they can be really bad for high schoolers as an insinuation of there's some like top-tier math

89
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,740
folk and they can do these problems really quickly. But if you give the same questions to the student

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,700
and you say rather than being forced to go through all of these in 75 minutes, you say let's spend

91
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,580
30 minutes on just one of them, right? Really delving into it. They're really solid problems

92
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,240
that kind of engage in the spirit of problem solving and you know removing that judgmental

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,780
aspect, removing that time aspect, I think you know that can help out a lot. A lot of people ask

94
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,580
about certain things that I've made promises for but haven't necessarily delivered on.

95
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,940
In a recent video, you know, I did one on divergence and curl and I mentioned at the end

96
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,240
an example of using complex numbers to model fluid flow and a certain model for flow around a wing.

97
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,380
And you might notice I have yet to actually put out a video on that and I've certainly seen a

98
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,600
number of commenters you know hampering on me for that fact. If there's ever a thing that I promise

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,820
and then I don't make a video on it, it's probably because I spent a good amount of time trying to

100
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,780
write a script for it that I just didn't feel was compelling for whatever reason. And I think maybe

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,540
the granddaddy here is the probability series, which at the moment I have five videos that I've

102
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,020
made that are you know released to patrons. I don't, I just don't feel great about them and I

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,440
kind of want the stuff that I put out to you guys to be something I feel is you know if not original,

104
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,640
something that wouldn't be out there otherwise from other creators. And there's a lot of good

105
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,240
probability material online. I will probably do something to release the material that I have,

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,200
either just as it is but on some second channel with the acknowledgement, hey this isn't the

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,720
greatest work I think I've done, or trying to rework them and make them standalones. But as far

108
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,440
as you know essence of blank content, I feel much clearer about how I would want to extend the linear

109
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,960
algebra series rather than spinning my wheels on certain scripts and animations that I ultimately

110
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,760
don't think are going to deliver something to you guys that I would feel proud of.

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,040
Do you have any questions, Jabril? I'm just reading from some Reddit ones here but we

112
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,100
do something live. How much compromise if any do you have to give with like what you can animate

113
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,780
versus like what your script is trying to convey? Usually if I can't animate a thing, and it's a

114
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,880
mathematical thing, it's not like a frivolous cartoonish type thing, I change the tool so

115
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,780
that it can animate that thing right and then that might take more time. And it's possible

116
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,440
that subconsciously that means I resist topics that I know would be more difficult to animate.

117
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't think that happens, I like to use that to encourage creation of new things right,

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,000
like on the divergence curl didn't have good fluid flow stuff but it was fun to play around with that.

119
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,220
For quaternions right now I think there's a lot of 3D related things that I wanted to sort of

120
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,620
upgrade because the previous way I was doing a lot of 3D animations was clunky and not as extensible

121
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,400
as I wanted it to be. So usually that is a good excuse to just improve the graphics tool.

122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,740
We have somewhere a question on here, what sort of music do you listen to?

123
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,980
Which I mostly wanted to answer to like mention my renewed love for the Punch Brothers. I don't

124
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,480
know if any of you know about them, they're actually super weird, they're like a avant-garde

125
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,780
bluegrass band. It's just five geniuses who get together and put out phenomenal art,

126
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,880
so can't complain about that. How do you compare making your videos to making videos for Khan

127
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,860
Academy? So very different processes right, like Khan Academy you imagine sitting next to someone

128
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,020
and tutoring them and just explaining it, you're writing everything by hand, for the most part you

129
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,500
do it live. On this channel I obviously script things, I put a lot of time into creating the

130
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,220
visuals for it. Sometimes in a way that makes me feel you know if at Khan Academy I could sit down

131
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,080
and make like three videos in an afternoon and here it's taking me like three weeks to do one

132
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,080
video. Which of these actually carries more of an impact? I think there's a proper balance for both

133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,280
of them and I think there's a lot of people out there who do the Khan style stuff to include Khan

134
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,960
Academy but also many others. The way I like to think about things is what wouldn't happen if I

135
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,740
wasn't doing it? But there is that little part of me that thinks maybe I should start some sort of

136
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,880
second channel of the super cheap, just like me and a notebook and a pencil like scrapping through

137
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,800
some sort of explanation super quickly. Who makes the awesome music playing in your videos?

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,240
Vince Rubenetti. Link in the description, link in all of the descriptions actually, he does really

139
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,180
good work and just go you know download some of the music and leave him a little tip if you feel

140
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,160
like it's something that you enjoy. What is your favorite Palomino? Palomino? Palimano? This one.

141
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,200
I'll figure it out later and insert it on the screen. All right folks, thanks for watching,

142
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,520
stick around for whenever the next upload is. It's going to be on Quaternions and I hope you like it.

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,980
This is your close-up and this is your wide. All right,

144
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,780
does that probably mean I should be looking at the wide one or do I do a dramatic like camera number two?
