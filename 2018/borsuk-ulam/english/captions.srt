1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,633
You know that feeling you get when things that seem 

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,440
completely unrelated turn out to have a key connection?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,782
In math especially, there's a certain tingly sensation I get 

4
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,440
whenever one of those connections starts to fall into place.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,340
This is what I have in store for you today.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,688
It takes some time to set up, I have to introduce a fair division puzzle from 

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,130
discrete math called the stolen necklace problem, 

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,646
as well as a topological fact about spheres that we'll use to solve it, 

9
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:29,160
called the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,369
But trust me, seeing these two seemingly disconnected 

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,520
pieces of math come together is well worth the setup.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,140
Let's start with the puzzle we're going to solve.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,903
You and your friend steal a necklace full of a bunch of jewels, 

14
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:45,240
maybe it's got some sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and rubies.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,420
They're all arranged on the necklace in some random order.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,340
And let's say it happens to be an even number of each type of jewel.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,340
Here I have 8 sapphires, 10 emeralds, 4 diamonds, and 6 rubies.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,087
You and your friend want to split up the booty evenly, 

19
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:06,959
with each of you getting half of each jewel type, that is 4 sapphires, 5 emeralds, 

20
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,720
2 diamonds, and 3 rubies each.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,576
Of course you could just cut off all the jewels and divvy them up evenly, 

22
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:14,600
but that's boring, there's not a puzzle there.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,777
Instead, the challenge is for you to make as few cuts to the necklace as 

24
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:22,495
possible so that you can divvy up the resulting segments between you and 

25
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:26,060
your co-conspirator, with each of you getting half of each jewel type.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,700
For example, for the arrangement I'm showing here, I just did it with 4 cuts.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,457
If I give the top 3 strands to you, and these bottom 2 strands to your co-conspirator, 

28
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:44,680
each of you ends up with 4 sapphires, 5 emeralds, 2 diamonds, and 3 rubies.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,501
The claim, the thing I want to prove in this video, 

30
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:53,675
is that if there are N different jewel types, it's always possible to do this fair 

31
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,920
division with only N cuts, or fewer.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,459
So with 4 jewel types, no matter what random ordering of the jewels, 

33
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,569
it should be possible to cut it in 4 places and divvy up the 5 necklace 

34
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:08,280
pieces so that each thief has the same number of each jewel type.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,924
With 5 jewel types you should be able to do it with 5 cuts, 

36
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,900
no matter the arrangement, and so on.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,560
It's kind of hard to think about, right?

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,472
You need to keep track of all of these different jewel types, 

39
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:23,760
ensuring they're divided fairly, while making as few cuts as possible.

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,900
And if you sit down to try this, this is a shockingly hard fact to prove.

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,531
Maybe the puzzle seems a little contrived, but its core characteristics, 

42
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,876
like trying to minimize sharding and allocating some collections of 

43
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:39,222
things in a balanced way, these are the kind of optimization issues 

44
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:42,420
that actually come up quite frequently in practical applications.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,153
For the computer system folks among you, I'm sure you can imagine 

46
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:49,460
how this is analogous to kinds of efficient memory allocation problems.

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,085
Also for the curious among you, I've left a link in the description 

48
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:56,220
to an electrical engineering paper that applies this specific problem.

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,060
Independent from the usefulness though, it certainly does make for a good puzzle.

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,440
Can you always find a fair division using only as many cuts as there are types of jewels?

51
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,849
So that's the puzzle, remember it, and now we take a seemingly unrelated 

52
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,360
sidestep to the total opposite side of the mathematical universe, topology.

53
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,728
Imagine taking a sphere in 3D space and squishing it somehow onto the 2D plane, 

54
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:24,020
stretching and morphing it however you'd like to do so.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,662
The only constraint I'll ask is that you do this continuously, 

56
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:31,502
which you can think of as meaning never cut the sphere or tear it in any way 

57
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,500
during this mapping.

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,311
As you do this, many different pairs of points will land on top of 

59
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:40,680
each other once they hit the plane, and that's not really a big deal.

60
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,126
The special fact we're going to use, known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, 

61
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:49,504
is that you will always be able to find a pair of points that started off on 

62
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:54,280
the exact opposite sides of the sphere, which land on each other during the mapping.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,940
Points on the exact opposite like this are called antipodes, or antipodal points.

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,955
For example, if you think of the sphere as Earth, 

65
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:10,292
and you're mapping as a straight projection of every point directly onto the 

66
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,403
plane of the equator, the north and the south pole, which are antipodal, 

67
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:15,980
each land on the same point.

68
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,478
And in this example, that's the only antipodal pair that lands on the same point, 

69
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,060
and the other antipodal pair will end up offset from each other somehow.

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,666
If you tweaked this function a bit, maybe shearing it during the projection, 

71
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,860
the north and the south pole don't land on each other anymore.

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,141
But when the topology gods close a door, they open a window, 

73
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:40,585
because the Borsuk-Ulam theorem guarantees that no matter what, 

74
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:44,620
there must be some other antipodal pair that now land on top of each other.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,056
The classic example to illustrate this idea, which math educators 

76
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,091
introducing Borsuk-Ulam are required by law to present, 

77
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:56,830
is that there must exist some pair of points on the opposite side of 

78
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,600
the Earth where the temperature and the barometric pressure are both precisely the same.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,245
This is because associating each point on the surface of the Earth with 

80
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:10,196
a pair of numbers, temperature and pressure, is the same thing as mapping 

81
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,027
the surface of the Earth onto a 2D coordinate plane, 

82
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:17,620
where the first coordinate represents temperature, and the second represents pressure.

83
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,170
The implicit assumption here is that temperature and pressure each vary continuously 

84
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,769
as you walk around the Earth, so this association is a continuous mapping from the 

85
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:32,480
sphere onto a plane, some non-tearing way to squish that surface into two dimensions.

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,854
So what Borsuk-Ulam implies is that no matter what the weather patterns on Earth, 

87
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:42,786
or any other planet for that matter, two antipodal points must land on top of each other, 

88
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:46,020
which means they map to the same temperature-pressure pair.

89
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,371
Since you're watching this video, you're probably a mathematician at heart, 

90
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,640
so you want to see why this is true, not just that it's true.

91
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,940
So let's take a little sidestep through topology-proof land, 

92
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,280
and I think you'll agree that this is a really satisfying line of reasoning.

93
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,466
First rephrasing what it is we want to show slightly more symbolically, 

94
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:11,409
if you have some function f that takes in a point p of the sphere and spits out some 

95
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:16,235
pair of coordinates, you want to show that no matter what crazy choice of function 

96
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:21,061
this is, as long as it's continuous, you'll be able to find some point p so that f 

97
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:25,945
of p equals f of negative where negative p is the antipodal point on the other side 

98
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:26,760
of the sphere.

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,762
The key idea here, which might seem small at first, 

100
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:37,736
is to rearrange this and say f of p minus f of negative p equals zero zero, 

101
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:43,102
and focus on a new function g of p that's defined to be this left-hand side here, 

102
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,000
f of p minus f of negative p.

103
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,578
This way, what we need to show is that g maps some 

104
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:51,420
point of the sphere onto the origin in 2D space.

105
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,840
So rather than finding a pair of colliding points which could land anywhere, 

106
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,760
this helps limit our focus to just one point of the output space, the origin.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,422
This function g has a pretty special property which is going to help us out, 

108
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:10,440
that g of negative p is equal to negative g of p.

109
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,940
Basically negating the input involves swapping these terms.

110
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,010
In other words, going to the antipodal point of the sphere 

111
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,339
results in reflecting the output of g through the origin of the output space, 

112
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,960
or rotating the output 180 degrees around the origin.

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,449
Notice what this means if you were to continuously 

114
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,100
walk around the equator and look at the outputs of g.

115
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,760
What happens when you go halfway around?

116
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,210
Well, the output needs to have wandered to the 

117
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,120
reflection of the starting point through the origin.

118
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,133
Then, as you continue walking around the other half, 

119
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:56,275
the second half of your output path must be the reflection of the first half, 

120
00:07:56,275 --> 00:08:00,560
or equivalently, it's the 180 degree rotation of that first path.

121
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,314
Now, there's a slim possibility that one of these points happens to pass 

122
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:10,800
through the origin, in which case you've lucked out and were done early.

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,720
But otherwise, what we have here is a path that winds around the origin at least once.

124
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,822
Now, look at that path on the equator, and imagine continuously 

125
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:25,200
deforming it up to the north pole, cinching that loop tight.

126
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,885
As you do this, the resulting path in the output space is also 

127
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:34,179
continuously deforming to a point, since the function g is continuous.

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,324
Now, because it wound around the origin at some point during this process, 

129
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:46,349
it must cross the origin, and this means there is some point p on the sphere where 

130
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:52,519
g of p has the coordinates 0,0, which means f of p minus f of negative p equals 0,0, 

131
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,980
meaning f of p is the same as f of negative p, the antipodal collision we're looking for.

132
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,160
Isn't that clever?

133
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
And it's a pretty common style of argument in the context of topology.

134
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,538
It doesn't matter what particular continuous function from the 

135
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:10,661
sphere to the plane you define, this line of reasoning will 

136
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:14,200
always zero in on an antipodal pair that lands on top of each other.

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,160
At this point, maybe you're thinking, yeah yeah, lovely math and all, 

138
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,800
but we've strayed pretty far away from the necklace problem.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,740
But just you wait, here's where things start getting clever.

140
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,600
First, answer me this.

141
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,080
What is a sphere, really?

142
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,629
Well, points in 3D space are represented with three coordinates, 

143
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,268
in some sense that's what 3D space is to a mathematician at least, 

144
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,060
all possible triplets of numbers.

145
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,004
And the simplest sphere to describe with coordinates is the standard unit 

146
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:48,743
sphere centered at the origin, the set of all points a distance 1 from the origin, 

147
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:52,740
meaning all triplets of numbers so that the sum of their squares is 1.

148
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,470
So the geometric idea of a sphere is related to the 

149
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,120
algebraic idea of a set of positive numbers that add up to 1.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,560
That might sound simple, but tuck that away in your mind.

151
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,068
If you have one of these triplets, the point on the opposite side of the sphere, 

152
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,781
the corresponding antipodal point, is whatever you get by 

153
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:12,840
flipping the sign of each coordinate, right?

154
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,860
So let's just write out what the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is saying symbolically.

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,720
Trust me, this will help with getting back to the necklace problem.

156
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,263
For any function that takes in points on the sphere, 

157
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:27,770
triplets of numbers who square sum to 1, and spits out some point in 2D space, 

158
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,965
some pair of coordinates like temperature and pressure, 

159
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:35,586
as long as the function is continuous, there will be some input so that flipping 

160
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:38,040
all of its signs doesn't change the output.

161
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,240
With that in mind, look back at the necklace problem.

162
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,004
Part of the reason these two things feel so very unrelated is that the necklace 

163
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:49,423
problem is discrete, while the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is continuous, 

164
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:54,034
so our first step is to translate the stolen necklace problem into a continuous version, 

165
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:57,920
seeking the connection between necklace divisions and points on the sphere.

166
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,136
For right now, let's limit ourselves to the case where there's only two jewel types, 

167
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,240
say sapphires and emeralds, and we're hoping to make a fair 

168
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,620
division of this necklace after only two cuts.

169
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,851
As an example, just to have up on the screen, let's 

170
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,620
say there's 8 sapphires and 10 emeralds on the necklace.

171
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,882
Just as a reminder, this means the goal is to cut the necklace in two different spots, 

172
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:24,373
and divvy up those three segments so that each thief ends up with 

173
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:26,860
half of the sapphires and half of the emeralds.

174
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,780
Notice the top and bottom each have 4 sapphires and 5 emeralds.

175
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,417
For our continuousification, think of the necklace as a line with length 1, 

176
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:41,323
with the jewels sitting evenly spaced on it, and divide up that 

177
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:44,680
line into 18 evenly sized segments, one for each jewel.

178
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,093
And rather than thinking of each jewel as a discrete, indivisible entity on each segment, 

179
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:54,040
remove the jewel itself, and just paint that segment the color of the jewel.

180
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,680
So in this case, 8 18ths of the line would be painted sapphire, 

181
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,960
and 10 18ths would be painted emerald.

182
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,913
The continuous variant of the puzzle is now to ask if we can find two cuts 

183
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:11,808
anywhere on this line, not necessarily on the 1 18th interval marks, 

184
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:16,720
that lets us divide up the pieces so that each thief has an equal length of each color.

185
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,295
In this case, each thief should have a total of 4 18ths of sapphire colored segments, 

186
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:24,600
and 5 18ths of emerald colored segments.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,244
An important but somewhat subtle point here is that if you can solve 

188
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:33,100
the continuous variant, you can also solve the original discrete version.

189
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,616
To see this, let's say you did find a fair division whose 

190
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:39,220
cuts didn't happen to fall cleanly between the jewels.

191
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Maybe it cuts only part way through an emerald segment.

192
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,389
Well, because this is a fair division, the length of emerald in both top and bottom has 

193
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,480
to add up to 5 total emerald segments, a whole number multiple of the segment lengths.

194
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,894
So even if the division cut partially into an emerald segment on the left, 

195
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:01,098
it has to cut partially into an emerald segment on the right, 

196
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:05,438
and more specifically in such a way that the total length adds up to a whole number 

197
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:07,040
multiple of the segment length.

198
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,273
What that means is that you can adjust each cut without affecting 

199
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:15,120
the division so that they ultimately do line up on the 1 18th marks.

200
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,740
Now why are we doing all this?

201
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,332
Well, in the continuous case, where you can cut wherever you want on this line, 

202
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:26,960
think about all of the choices going into dividing the necklace and allocating the pieces.

203
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,558
First you choose two locations to cut the interval, 

204
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:34,515
but another way to think about that is to choose three positive numbers 

205
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:35,560
that add up to one.

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,390
For example, maybe you choose 1 6th, 1 3rd, and 1 half, 

207
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,460
which correspond to these two cuts.

208
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,245
Any time you find three positive numbers that add up to one, 

209
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:47,720
it gives you a way to cut the necklace, and vice versa.

210
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,452
After that, you have to make a binary choice for each of these pieces, 

211
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,720
for whether it goes to thief 1 or thief 2.

212
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,287
Now compare that to if I asked you to choose some arbitrary point on a sphere in 

213
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:03,952
three-dimensional space, some point with coordinates x, y, z, 

214
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:06,080
so that x2 plus y2 plus z2 equals 1.

215
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, you might start off by choosing three positive numbers that add to one.

216
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,360
Maybe you want x2 to be 1 6th, y2 to be 1 3rd, and z2 to be 1 half.

217
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,979
Then you have to make a binary choice for each one of them, 

218
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:23,691
choosing whether to take the positive square root or the negative square root, 

219
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:27,780
in a way that's completely parallel to dividing the necklace and allocating the pieces.

220
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,960
Alright, hang with me now, because this is the key observation of the whole video.

221
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,820
It gives a correspondence between points on the sphere and necklace divisions.

222
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,984
For any point x, y, z on the sphere, because x2 plus y2 plus z2 is 1, 

223
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,250
you can cut the necklace so that the first piece has a length x2, 

224
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,000
the second has a length y2, and the third has a length z2.

225
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,540
For that first piece, if x is positive, give it to thief 1, otherwise give it to thief 2.

226
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,177
For the second piece, if y is positive, give it to thief 1, 

227
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,269
otherwise give it to thief 2, and likewise give the third 

228
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,840
piece to thief 1 if z is positive, and to thief 2 if z is negative.

229
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,220
And you could go the other way around.

230
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,267
Any way that you divide up the necklace and divvy 

231
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:16,020
up the pieces gives us a unique point on the sphere.

232
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,455
It's as if the sphere is a weirdly perfect way to encapsulate the 

233
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:24,460
idea of all possible necklace divisions, just with a geometric object.

234
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,340
And here we are tantalizingly close.

235
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,060
Think of the meaning of antipodal points under this association.

236
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,052
If the point x, y, z on the sphere corresponds to some necklace allocation, 

237
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:40,080
what does the point negative x, negative y, and negative z correspond to?

238
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,233
Well, the squares of these three coordinates are the same, 

239
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,720
so each one corresponds to making the same cuts on the necklace.

240
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,180
The difference is that every piece switches which thief it belongs to.

241
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,426
So jumping to an antipodal point on the opposite side 

242
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:58,260
of the sphere corresponds with exchanging the pieces.

243
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,320
Now remember what it is that we're actually looking for.

244
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,515
We want the total length of each jewel type belonging 

245
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,020
to thief 1 to equal that for thief 2.

246
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,313
Or in other words, in a fair division, performing this antipodal 

247
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:16,980
swap doesn't change the amount of each jewel belonging to each thief.

248
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,360
Your brain should be burning with the thought of Borsuk Ulam at this point.

249
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,414
Specifically, you might construct a function that takes in a given necklace 

250
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:31,607
allocation and spits out two numbers, the total length of sapphire belonging to thief 1, 

251
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,700
and the total length of emerald belonging to thief 1.

252
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,380
We want to show that there must exist a way to divide the necklace, with two cuts, 

253
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,949
and divvy up the pieces so that these two numbers are the same as what they would be for 

254
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:44,360
thief 2.

255
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,820
Or said differently, where swapping all of the pieces wouldn't change those two numbers.

256
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,228
Because of this back and forth between necklace allocations and the points of the sphere, 

257
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:58,914
and because pairs of numbers correspond with points on the xy-plane, 

258
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,960
this is, in effect, a map from the sphere onto the plane.

259
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,043
And the animation you're looking at right now is 

260
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,300
that literal map for the necklace I was showing.

261
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,480
So the Borsuk-Ulam theorem guarantees that some antipodal pair of points on 

262
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,409
the sphere land on each other in the plane, which means there must be some 

263
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,599
necklace division using two cuts that gives a fair division between the thieves.

264
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,420
That, my friends, is what beautiful math feels like.

265
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,790
Alright, and if you're anything like me, you're just basking in the glow of what 

266
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,214
a clever proof that is, and it might be easy to forget that what we actually want 

267
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:43,800
to solve is the more general stolen necklace problem, with any number of jewel types.

268
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,640
Luckily, we've now done 95% of the work.

269
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,220
Generalizing is pretty brief.

270
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,335
The main thing to mention is that there is a more general version of 

271
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:55,900
the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, one that applies to higher dimensional spheres.

272
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,251
As an example, Borsuk-Ulam applies to mapping 

273
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,940
hyperspheres in 4D space into three dimensions.

274
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,348
And what I mean by a hypersphere is the set of all possible lists 

275
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:09,720
of four coordinates where the sum of their squares equals one.

276
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,500
Those are the points in 4D space a distance one from the origin.

277
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,553
Borsuk-Ulam says that if you try to map that set, 

278
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:21,864
all those special quadruplets of numbers, into three-dimensional space, 

279
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:25,696
continuously associating each one with some triplet of numbers, 

280
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:29,587
there must be some antipodal collision, an input x1, x2, x3, x4, 

281
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:33,120
where flipping all of the signs wouldn't change the output.

282
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,273
I'll leave it to you to pause and ponder and think about how this 

283
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:41,364
could apply to the And about what the general statement of Borsuk-Ulam might be, 

284
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:43,940
and how it applies to the general necklace problem.

285
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,612
And maybe, just maybe, this gives you an inkling of why 

286
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:50,832
mathematicians care about things like higher dimensional spheres, 

287
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:53,760
regardless of whether or not they exist in physical reality.

288
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,045
It's not always about the sphere per se, it's about 

289
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,760
what other problems in math they can be used to encode.
