1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,480
You know that feeling you get when things that seem completely unrelated turn out to

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,440
have a key connection?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,240
In math especially, there's a certain tingly sensation I get whenever one of those connections

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,440
starts to fall into place.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,340
This is what I have in store for you today.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,000
It takes some time to set up, I have to introduce a fair division puzzle from discrete math

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,840
called the stolen necklace problem, as well as a topological fact about spheres that we'll

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,160
use to solve it, called the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,040
But trust me, seeing these two seemingly disconnected pieces of math come together is well worth

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,520
the setup.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,140
Let's start with the puzzle we're going to solve.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,580
You and your friend steal a necklace full of a bunch of jewels, maybe it's got some

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,240
sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and rubies.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,420
They're all arranged on the necklace in some random order.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,340
And let's say it happens to be an even number of each type of jewel.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,340
Here I have 8 sapphires, 10 emeralds, 4 diamonds, and 6 rubies.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,120
You and your friend want to split up the booty evenly, with each of you getting half of each

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,720
jewel type, that is 4 sapphires, 5 emeralds, 2 diamonds, and 3 rubies each.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,420
Of course you could just cut off all the jewels and divvy them up evenly, but that's boring,

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,600
there's not a puzzle there.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,540
Instead, the challenge is for you to make as few cuts to the necklace as possible so

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,980
that you can divvy up the resulting segments between you and your co-conspirator, with

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,060
each of you getting half of each jewel type.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,700
For example, for the arrangement I'm showing here, I just did it with 4 cuts.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,000
If I give the top 3 strands to you, and these bottom 2 strands to your co-conspirator, each

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,680
of you ends up with 4 sapphires, 5 emeralds, 2 diamonds, and 3 rubies.

27
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,520
The claim, the thing I want to prove in this video, is that if there are N different jewel

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,920
types, it's always possible to do this fair division with only N cuts, or fewer.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,840
So with 4 jewel types, no matter what random ordering of the jewels, it should be possible

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,300
to cut it in 4 places and divvy up the 5 necklace pieces so that each thief has the same number

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,280
of each jewel type.

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,500
With 5 jewel types you should be able to do it with 5 cuts, no matter the arrangement,

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,900
and so on.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,560
It's kind of hard to think about, right?

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,680
You need to keep track of all of these different jewel types, ensuring they're divided fairly,

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,760
while making as few cuts as possible.

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,900
And if you sit down to try this, this is a shockingly hard fact to prove.

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,100
Maybe the puzzle seems a little contrived, but its core characteristics, like trying

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,260
to minimize sharding and allocating some collections of things in a balanced way, these are the

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,420
kind of optimization issues that actually come up quite frequently in practical applications.

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,740
For the computer system folks among you, I'm sure you can imagine how this is analogous

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,460
to kinds of efficient memory allocation problems.

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,440
Also for the curious among you, I've left a link in the description to an electrical

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,220
engineering paper that applies this specific problem.

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,060
Independent from the usefulness though, it certainly does make for a good puzzle.

46
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,440
Can you always find a fair division using only as many cuts as there are types of jewels?

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,800
So that's the puzzle, remember it, and now we take a seemingly unrelated sidestep to

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,360
the total opposite side of the mathematical universe, topology.

49
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,300
Imagine taking a sphere in 3D space and squishing it somehow onto the 2D plane, stretching and

50
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,020
morphing it however you'd like to do so.

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,480
The only constraint I'll ask is that you do this continuously, which you can think

52
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,500
of as meaning never cut the sphere or tear it in any way during this mapping.

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,340
As you do this, many different pairs of points will land on top of each other once they hit

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,680
the plane, and that's not really a big deal.

55
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,500
The special fact we're going to use, known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, is that you will

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,320
always be able to find a pair of points that started off on the exact opposite sides of

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,280
the sphere, which land on each other during the mapping.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,940
Points on the exact opposite like this are called antipodes, or antipodal points.

59
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,780
For example, if you think of the sphere as Earth, and you're mapping as a straight

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,400
projection of every point directly onto the plane of the equator, the north and the south

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,980
pole, which are antipodal, each land on the same point.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,100
And in this example, that's the only antipodal pair that lands on the same point, and the

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,060
other antipodal pair will end up offset from each other somehow.

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,500
If you tweaked this function a bit, maybe shearing it during the projection, the north

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,860
and the south pole don't land on each other anymore.

66
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,540
But when the topology gods close a door, they open a window, because the Borsuk-Ulam theorem

67
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,680
guarantees that no matter what, there must be some other antipodal pair that now land

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,620
on top of each other.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,160
The classic example to illustrate this idea, which math educators introducing Borsuk-Ulam

70
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,140
are required by law to present, is that there must exist some pair of points on the opposite

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,100
side of the Earth where the temperature and the barometric pressure are both precisely

72
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,600
the same.

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,580
This is because associating each point on the surface of the Earth with a pair of numbers,

74
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,560
temperature and pressure, is the same thing as mapping the surface of the Earth onto a

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,220
2D coordinate plane, where the first coordinate represents temperature, and the second represents

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,620
pressure.

77
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,700
The implicit assumption here is that temperature and pressure each vary continuously as you

78
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,740
walk around the Earth, so this association is a continuous mapping from the sphere onto

79
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,480
a plane, some non-tearing way to squish that surface into two dimensions.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,380
So what Borsuk-Ulam implies is that no matter what the weather patterns on Earth, or any

81
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,280
other planet for that matter, two antipodal points must land on top of each other, which

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,020
means they map to the same temperature-pressure pair.

83
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,480
Since you're watching this video, you're probably a mathematician at heart, so you

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,640
want to see why this is true, not just that it's true.

85
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,020
So let's take a little sidestep through topology-proof land, and I think you'll

86
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,280
agree that this is a really satisfying line of reasoning.

87
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,560
First rephrasing what it is we want to show slightly more symbolically, if you have some

88
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,120
function f that takes in a point p of the sphere and spits out some pair of coordinates,

89
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,540
you want to show that no matter what crazy choice of function this is, as long as it's

90
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,220
continuous, you'll be able to find some point p so that f of p equals f of negative

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,760
where negative p is the antipodal point on the other side of the sphere.

92
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,820
The key idea here, which might seem small at first, is to rearrange this and say f of

93
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,840
p minus f of negative p equals zero zero, and focus on a new function g of p that's

94
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,000
defined to be this left-hand side here, f of p minus f of negative p.

95
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,800
This way, what we need to show is that g maps some point of the sphere onto the origin in

96
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,420
2D space.

97
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,160
So rather than finding a pair of colliding points which could land anywhere, this helps

98
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,760
limit our focus to just one point of the output space, the origin.

99
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,640
This function g has a pretty special property which is going to help us out, that g of negative

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,440
p is equal to negative g of p.

101
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,940
Basically negating the input involves swapping these terms.

102
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,400
In other words, going to the antipodal point of the sphere results in reflecting the output

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,440
of g through the origin of the output space, or rotating the output 180 degrees around

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,960
the origin.

105
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,680
Notice what this means if you were to continuously walk around the equator and look at the outputs

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,100
of g.

107
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,760
What happens when you go halfway around?

108
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,500
Well, the output needs to have wandered to the reflection of the starting point through

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,120
the origin.

110
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,740
Then, as you continue walking around the other half, the second half of your output path

111
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,160
must be the reflection of the first half, or equivalently, it's the 180 degree rotation

112
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,560
of that first path.

113
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,000
Now, there's a slim possibility that one of these points happens to pass through the

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
origin, in which case you've lucked out and were done early.

115
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,720
But otherwise, what we have here is a path that winds around the origin at least once.

116
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,180
Now, look at that path on the equator, and imagine continuously deforming it up to the

117
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,200
north pole, cinching that loop tight.

118
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,180
As you do this, the resulting path in the output space is also continuously deforming

119
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,180
to a point, since the function g is continuous.

120
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,820
Now, because it wound around the origin at some point during this process, it must cross

121
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,320
the origin, and this means there is some point p on the sphere where g of p has the coordinates

122
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,640
0,0, which means f of p minus f of negative p equals 0,0, meaning f of p is the same as

123
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,980
f of negative p, the antipodal collision we're looking for.

124
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,160
Isn't that clever?

125
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
And it's a pretty common style of argument in the context of topology.

126
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,040
It doesn't matter what particular continuous function from the sphere to the plane you

127
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,120
define, this line of reasoning will always zero in on an antipodal pair that lands on

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,200
top of each other.

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,940
At this point, maybe you're thinking, yeah yeah, lovely math and all, but we've strayed

130
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,800
pretty far away from the necklace problem.

131
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,740
But just you wait, here's where things start getting clever.

132
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,600
First, answer me this.

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,080
What is a sphere, really?

134
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,420
Well, points in 3D space are represented with three coordinates, in some sense that's

135
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,060
what 3D space is to a mathematician at least, all possible triplets of numbers.

136
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,780
And the simplest sphere to describe with coordinates is the standard unit sphere centered at the

137
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,360
origin, the set of all points a distance 1 from the origin, meaning all triplets of numbers

138
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,740
so that the sum of their squares is 1.

139
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,920
So the geometric idea of a sphere is related to the algebraic idea of a set of positive

140
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,120
numbers that add up to 1.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,560
That might sound simple, but tuck that away in your mind.

142
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,840
If you have one of these triplets, the point on the opposite side of the sphere, the corresponding

143
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,840
antipodal point, is whatever you get by flipping the sign of each coordinate, right?

144
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,860
So let's just write out what the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is saying symbolically.

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,720
Trust me, this will help with getting back to the necklace problem.

146
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,660
For any function that takes in points on the sphere, triplets of numbers who square sum

147
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,560
to 1, and spits out some point in 2D space, some pair of coordinates like temperature

148
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,500
and pressure, as long as the function is continuous, there will be some input so that flipping

149
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,040
all of its signs doesn't change the output.

150
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,240
With that in mind, look back at the necklace problem.

151
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,320
Part of the reason these two things feel so very unrelated is that the necklace problem

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,860
is discrete, while the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is continuous, so our first step is to translate

153
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,260
the stolen necklace problem into a continuous version, seeking the connection between necklace

154
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,920
divisions and points on the sphere.

155
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,520
For right now, let's limit ourselves to the case where there's only two jewel types,

156
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,640
say sapphires and emeralds, and we're hoping to make a fair division of this necklace after

157
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,620
only two cuts.

158
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,060
As an example, just to have up on the screen, let's say there's 8 sapphires and 10 emeralds

159
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,620
on the necklace.

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,020
Just as a reminder, this means the goal is to cut the necklace in two different spots,

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,220
and divvy up those three segments so that each thief ends up with half of the sapphires

162
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,860
and half of the emeralds.

163
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,780
Notice the top and bottom each have 4 sapphires and 5 emeralds.

164
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,980
For our continuousification, think of the necklace as a line with length 1, with the

165
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,520
jewels sitting evenly spaced on it, and divide up that line into 18 evenly sized segments,

166
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,680
one for each jewel.

167
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,540
And rather than thinking of each jewel as a discrete, indivisible entity on each segment,

168
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,040
remove the jewel itself, and just paint that segment the color of the jewel.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,120
So in this case, 8 18ths of the line would be painted sapphire, and 10 18ths would be

170
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
painted emerald.

171
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,360
The continuous variant of the puzzle is now to ask if we can find two cuts anywhere on

172
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,140
this line, not necessarily on the 1 18th interval marks, that lets us divide up the

173
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,720
pieces so that each thief has an equal length of each color.

174
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,240
In this case, each thief should have a total of 4 18ths of sapphire colored segments, and

175
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,600
5 18ths of emerald colored segments.

176
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,540
An important but somewhat subtle point here is that if you can solve the continuous variant,

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,100
you can also solve the original discrete version.

178
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,980
To see this, let's say you did find a fair division whose cuts didn't happen to fall

179
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,220
cleanly between the jewels.

180
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Maybe it cuts only part way through an emerald segment.

181
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,280
Well, because this is a fair division, the length of emerald in both top and bottom has

182
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,480
to add up to 5 total emerald segments, a whole number multiple of the segment lengths.

183
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,760
So even if the division cut partially into an emerald segment on the left, it has to

184
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,160
cut partially into an emerald segment on the right, and more specifically in such a way

185
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,040
that the total length adds up to a whole number multiple of the segment length.

186
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,140
What that means is that you can adjust each cut without affecting the division so that

187
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,120
they ultimately do line up on the 1 18th marks.

188
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,740
Now why are we doing all this?

189
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,860
Well, in the continuous case, where you can cut wherever you want on this line, think

190
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,960
about all of the choices going into dividing the necklace and allocating the pieces.

191
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,260
First you choose two locations to cut the interval, but another way to think about that

192
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,560
is to choose three positive numbers that add up to one.

193
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,120
For example, maybe you choose 1 6th, 1 3rd, and 1 half, which correspond to these two

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,460
cuts.

195
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,400
Any time you find three positive numbers that add up to one, it gives you a way to cut the

196
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,720
necklace, and vice versa.

197
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,820
After that, you have to make a binary choice for each of these pieces, for whether it goes

198
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,720
to thief 1 or thief 2.

199
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,160
Now compare that to if I asked you to choose some arbitrary point on a sphere in three-dimensional

200
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,080
space, some point with coordinates x, y, z, so that x2 plus y2 plus z2 equals 1.

201
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, you might start off by choosing three positive numbers that add to one.

202
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,360
Maybe you want x2 to be 1 6th, y2 to be 1 3rd, and z2 to be 1 half.

203
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,220
Then you have to make a binary choice for each one of them, choosing whether to take

204
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,340
the positive square root or the negative square root, in a way that's completely parallel

205
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,780
to dividing the necklace and allocating the pieces.

206
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,960
Alright, hang with me now, because this is the key observation of the whole video.

207
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,820
It gives a correspondence between points on the sphere and necklace divisions.

208
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,280
For any point x, y, z on the sphere, because x2 plus y2 plus z2 is 1, you can cut the necklace

209
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,220
so that the first piece has a length x2, the second has a length y2, and the third has

210
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,000
a length z2.

211
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,160
For that first piece, if x is positive, give it to thief 1, otherwise give it to thief

212
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,540
2.

213
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,880
For the second piece, if y is positive, give it to thief 1, otherwise give it to thief

214
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,520
2, and likewise give the third piece to thief 1 if z is positive, and to thief 2 if z is

215
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,840
negative.

216
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,220
And you could go the other way around.

217
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,240
Any way that you divide up the necklace and divvy up the pieces gives us a unique point

218
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,020
on the sphere.

219
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,640
It's as if the sphere is a weirdly perfect way to encapsulate the idea of all possible

220
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,460
necklace divisions, just with a geometric object.

221
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,340
And here we are tantalizingly close.

222
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,060
Think of the meaning of antipodal points under this association.

223
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,780
If the point x, y, z on the sphere corresponds to some necklace allocation, what does the

224
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,080
point negative x, negative y, and negative z correspond to?

225
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,200
Well, the squares of these three coordinates are the same, so each one corresponds to making

226
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,720
the same cuts on the necklace.

227
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,180
The difference is that every piece switches which thief it belongs to.

228
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,620
So jumping to an antipodal point on the opposite side of the sphere corresponds with exchanging

229
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,260
the pieces.

230
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,320
Now remember what it is that we're actually looking for.

231
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:08,020
We want the total length of each jewel type belonging to thief 1 to equal that for thief 2.

232
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,120
Or in other words, in a fair division, performing this antipodal swap doesn't change the amount

233
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,980
of each jewel belonging to each thief.

234
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,360
Your brain should be burning with the thought of Borsuk Ulam at this point.

235
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,660
Specifically, you might construct a function that takes in a given necklace allocation

236
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,120
and spits out two numbers, the total length of sapphire belonging to thief 1, and the

237
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,700
total length of emerald belonging to thief 1.

238
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,940
We want to show that there must exist a way to divide the necklace, with two cuts, and

239
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,360
divvy up the pieces so that these two numbers are the same as what they would be for thief 2.

240
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,820
Or said differently, where swapping all of the pieces wouldn't change those two numbers.

241
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,300
Because of this back and forth between necklace allocations and the points of the sphere,

242
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,440
and because pairs of numbers correspond with points on the xy-plane, this is, in effect,

243
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,960
a map from the sphere onto the plane.

244
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,300
And the animation you're looking at right now is that literal map for the necklace I was showing.

245
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,220
So the Borsuk-Ulam theorem guarantees that some antipodal pair of points on the sphere

246
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,240
land on each other in the plane, which means there must be some necklace division using

247
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,600
two cuts that gives a fair division between the thieves.

248
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,420
That, my friends, is what beautiful math feels like.

249
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,300
Alright, and if you're anything like me, you're just basking in the glow of what

250
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,540
a clever proof that is, and it might be easy to forget that what we actually want to solve

251
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,800
is the more general stolen necklace problem, with any number of jewel types.

252
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,220
Luckily, we've now done 95% of the work. Generalizing is pretty brief.

253
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,220
The main thing to mention is that there is a more general version of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem,

254
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,900
one that applies to higher dimensional spheres.

255
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,940
As an example, Borsuk-Ulam applies to mapping hyperspheres in 4D space into three dimensions.

256
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,280
And what I mean by a hypersphere is the set of all possible lists of four coordinates

257
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,720
where the sum of their squares equals one.

258
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,500
Those are the points in 4D space a distance one from the origin.

259
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,980
Borsuk-Ulam says that if you try to map that set, all those special quadruplets of numbers,

260
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,620
into three-dimensional space, continuously associating each one with some triplet of numbers,

261
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,200
there must be some antipodal collision, an input x1, x2, x3, x4,

262
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,120
where flipping all of the signs wouldn't change the output.

263
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,480
I'll leave it to you to pause and ponder and think about how this could apply to the

264
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,480
And about what the general statement of Borsuk-Ulam might be,

265
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,940
and how it applies to the general necklace problem.

266
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,420
And maybe, just maybe, this gives you an inkling of why mathematicians care about things like

267
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,760
higher dimensional spheres, regardless of whether or not they exist in physical reality.

268
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,140
It's not always about the sphere per se, it's about what other problems in math they can be used to encode.
