1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
You know that feeling you get when things that seem completely unrelated turn out to

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,160
have a key connection?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,280
In math especially, there's a certain tingly sensation I get whenever one of those connections

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,380
starts to fall into place.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,960
This is what I have in store for you today.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,240
It takes some time to set up, I have to introduce a fair division puzzle from discrete math

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
called the stolen necklace problem, as well as a topological fact about spheres that we'll

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,860
use to solve it, called the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,000
But trust me, seeing these two seemingly disconnected pieces of math come together is well worth

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the setup.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,540
Let's start with the puzzle we're going to solve.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,600
You and your friend steal a necklace full of a bunch of jewels, maybe it's got some

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,260
sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and rubies.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,140
They're all arranged on the necklace in some random order.

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,240
And let's say it happens to be an even number of each type of jewel.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,040
Here I have 8 sapphires, 10 emeralds, 4 diamonds, and 6 rubies.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,960
You and your friend want to split up the booty evenly, with each of you getting half of each

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,400
jewel type, that is 4 sapphires, 5 emeralds, 2 diamonds, and 3 rubies each.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,120
Of course you could just cut off all of the jewels and divvy them up evenly, but that's

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
boring, there's not a puzzle there.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,480
Instead, the challenge is for you to make as few cuts to the necklace as possible so

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,900
that you can divvy up the resulting segments between you and your co-conspirator, with

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,280
each of you getting half of each jewel type.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,320
For example, for the arrangement I'm showing here, I just did it with 4 cuts.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,960
If I give the top 3 strands to you, and these bottom 2 strands to your co-conspirator, each

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,320
of you ends up with 4 sapphires, 5 emeralds, 2 diamonds, and 3 rubies.

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,760
The claim, the thing I want to prove in this video, is that if there are N different jewel

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,700
types, it's always possible to do this fair division with only N cuts or fewer.

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,860
So with 4 jewel types, no matter what random ordering of the jewels, it should be possible

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,260
to cut it in 4 places and divvy up the 5 necklace pieces so that each thief has the same number

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,040
of each jewel type.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,080
With 5 jewel types you should be able to do it with 5 cuts, no matter the arrangement,

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
and so on.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,840
It's kind of hard to think about, right?

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,120
You need to keep track of all of these different jewel types, ensuring they're divided fairly,

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,600
while making as few cuts as possible.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,080
And if you sit down to try this, this is a shockingly hard fact to prove.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,100
Maybe the puzzle seems a little contrived, but its core characteristics, like trying

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,200
to minimize sharding and allocating some collections of things in a balanced way, these are the

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,160
kind of optimization issues that actually come up quite frequently in practical applications.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,800
For the computer system folks among you, I'm sure you can imagine how this is analogous

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
to kinds of efficient memory allocation problems.

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,480
Also, for the curious among you, I've left a link in the description to an electrical

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,040
engineering paper that applies this specific problem.

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,840
Independent from the usefulness, though, it certainly does make for a good puzzle.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,520
Can you always find a fair division using only as many cuts as there are types of jewels?

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,700
So that's the puzzle, remember it, and now we take a seemingly unrelated sidestep to

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,520
the total opposite side of the mathematical universe, topology.

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,260
Imagine taking a sphere in 3D space and squishing it somehow onto the 2D plane, stretching and

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,600
morphing it however you'd like to do so.

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,460
The only constraint I'll ask is that you do this continuously, which you can think

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,320
of as meaning never cut the sphere or tear it in any way during this mapping.

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,320
As you do this, many different pairs of points will land on top of each other once they hit

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,280
the plane, and that's not really a big deal.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
The special fact that we're going to use, known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, is that

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,860
you will always be able to find a pair of points that started off on the exact opposite

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:57,600
sides of the sphere, which land on each other during the mapping.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Points on the exact opposite like this are called antipodes, or antipodal points.

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,300
For example, if you think of the sphere as Earth and your mapping as a straight projection

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,320
of every point directly onto the plane of the equator, the North and South Pole, which

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,600
are antipodal, each land on the same point.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,080
And in this example, that's the only antipodal pair that lands on the same point, and the

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,080
other antipodal pair will end up offset from each other somehow.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,500
If you tweaked this function a bit, maybe shearing it during the projection, the North

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,320
and South Pole don't land on each other anymore.

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,600
But when the topology gods close a door, they open a window, because the Borsuk-Ulam theorem

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,680
guarantees that no matter what, there must be some other antipodal pair that now land

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,560
on top of each other.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,240
The classic example to illustrate this idea, which math educators introducing Borsuk-Ulam

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,160
are required by law to present, is that there must exist some pair of points on the opposite

71
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
side of the Earth where the temperature and the barometric pressure are both precisely

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
the same.

73
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,140
This is because associating each point on the surface of the Earth with a pair of numbers,

74
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,380
is the same thing as mapping the surface of the Earth onto a 2D coordinate plane, where

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,520
the first coordinate represents temperature and the second represents pressure.

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,620
The implicit assumption here is that temperature and pressure each vary continuously as you

77
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,220
walk around the Earth.

78
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,900
So this association is a continuous mapping from the sphere onto a plane, some non-tearing

79
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,400
way to squish that surface into two dimensions.

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,320
What Borsuk-Ulam implies is that no matter what the weather patterns on Earth, or any

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,220
other planet for that matter, two antipodal points must land on top of each other, which

82
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,480
means they map to the same temperature-pressure pair.

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,400
Since you're watching this video, you're probably a mathematician at heart, so you

84
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,400
want to see why this is true, not just that it's true.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,960
So let's take a little sidestep through topology-proof land, and I think you'll

86
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,760
agree that this is a really satisfying line of reasoning.

87
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,680
First, rephrasing what it is we want to show slightly more symbolically, if you have some

88
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,680
function f that takes in a point p of the sphere and spits out some pair of coordinates,

89
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,800
you want to show that no matter what crazy choice of function this is, as long as it's

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,400
continuous, you'll be able to find some point p so that f of p equals f of negative

91
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,380
p, where negative p is the antipodal point on the other side of the sphere.

92
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,620
The key idea here, which might seem small at first, is to rearrange this and say f

93
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,860
of p minus f of negative p equals zero zero, and focus on a new function g of p that's

94
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,580
defined to be this left-hand side here, f of p minus f of negative p.

95
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,660
This way, what we need to show is that g maps some point of the sphere onto the origin in

96
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
2D space.

97
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,100
So rather than finding a pair of colliding points which could land anywhere, this helps

98
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,740
limit our focus to just one point of the output space, the origin.

99
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,620
This function g has a pretty special property which is going to help us out, that g of negative

100
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,020
p is equal to negative g of p.

101
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,160
Basically negating the input involves swapping these terms.

102
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,460
In other words, going to the antipodal point of the sphere results in reflecting the output

103
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:28,420
of g through the origin of the output space, or rotating the output 180 degrees around

104
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,100
the origin.

105
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,660
Notice what this means if you were to continuously walk around the equator and look at the outputs

106
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
of g.

107
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,140
What happens when you go halfway around?

108
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,420
Well, the output needs to have wandered to the reflection of the starting point through

109
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,140
the origin.

110
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,060
Then as you continue walking around the other half, the second half of your output path

111
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,380
must be the reflection of the first half, or equivalently, it's the 180 degree rotation

112
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,540
of the first half.

113
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,900
Now, there's a slim possibility that one of these points happens to pass through the

114
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,460
origin, in which case you've lucked out and were done early.

115
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,380
But otherwise, what we have here is a path that winds around the origin at least once.

116
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,060
Now, look at that path on the equator, and imagine continuously deforming it up to the

117
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,140
north pole, cinching that loop tight.

118
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,340
As you do this, the resulting path in the output space is also continuously deforming

119
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,860
to a point, since the function g is continuous.

120
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,980
Because it wound around the origin at some point during this process, it must cross the

121
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,300
origin, and this means there is some point p on the sphere where g of p has the coordinates

122
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:55,580
0,0, which means f of p minus f of negative p equals 0,0, meaning f of p is the same as

123
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,900
f of negative p, the antipodal collision we're looking for.

124
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,620
Isn't that clever?

125
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,360
And it's a pretty common style of argument in the context of topology.

126
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,980
It doesn't matter what particular continuous function from the sphere to the plane you

127
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,020
define, this line of reasoning will always zero in on an antipodal pair that lands on

128
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,260
top of each other.

129
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,860
At this point, maybe you're thinking, yeah yeah, lovely math and all, but we've strayed

130
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,380
pretty far away from the necklace problem.

131
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,260
But just you wait, here's where things start getting clever.

132
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
First, answer me this.

133
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,780
What is a sphere, really?

134
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,580
Well, points in 3d space are represented with three coordinates, in some sense that's

135
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,980
what 3d space is, to a mathematician at least, all possible triplets of numbers.

136
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,660
And the simplest sphere to describe with coordinates is the standard unit sphere, centered at the

137
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,580
origin, the set of all points a distance 1 from the origin, meaning all triplets of numbers

138
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,540
so that the sum of their squares is 1.

139
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,900
So the geometric idea of a sphere is related to the algebraic idea of a set of positive

140
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,380
numbers that add up to 1.

141
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,380
That might sound simple, but tuck that away in your mind.

142
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,860
If you have one of these triplets, the point on the opposite side of the sphere, the corresponding

143
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,620
antipodal point, is whatever you get by flipping the sign of each coordinate, right?

144
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,420
So let's just write out what the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is saying symbolically.

145
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,400
Trust me, this will help with getting back to the necklace problem.

146
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,600
For any function that takes in points on the sphere, triplets of numbers who square sum

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,560
to 1, and spits out some point in 2d space, some pair of coordinates like temperature

148
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,140
and pressure, as long as the function is continuous, there will be some input so that

149
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,220
flipping all of its signs doesn't change the output.

150
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,960
With that in mind, look back at the necklace problem.

151
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,360
Part of the reason these two things feel so very unrelated is that the necklace problem

152
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,820
is discrete, while the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is continuous, so our first step is to translate

153
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,200
the stolen necklace problem into a continuous version, seeking the connection between necklace

154
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
divisions and points on the sphere.

155
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,900
For right now, let's limit ourselves to the case where there's only two jewel types,

156
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,680
say sapphires and emeralds, and we're hoping to make a fair division of this necklace after

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,400
only two cuts.

158
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,960
As an example, just to have up on the screen, let's say there's 8 sapphires and 10 emeralds

159
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,360
on the necklace.

160
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,500
Just as a reminder, this means the goal is to cut the necklace in two different spots,

161
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,320
and divvy up those three segments so that each thief ends up with half of the sapphires

162
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,200
and half of the emeralds.

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Notice the top and bottom each have 4 sapphires and 5 emeralds.

164
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,800
For our continuousification, think of the necklace as a line with length 1, with the

165
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,960
jewels sitting evenly spaced on it, and divide up that line into 18 evenly sized segments,

166
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
one for each jewel.

167
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,280
And rather than thinking of each jewel as a discrete, indivisible entity on each segment,

168
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,900
remove the jewel itself, and just paint that segment the color of the jewel.

169
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,020
So in this case, 8 18ths of the line would be painted sapphire, and 10 18ths would be

170
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,800
painted emerald.

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,320
The continuous variant of the puzzle is now to ask if we can find two cuts anywhere on

172
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,720
this line, not necessarily on the 1 18th interval marks, that lets us divide up the pieces so

173
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,920
that each thief has an equal length of each color.

174
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,200
In this case, each thief should have a total of 4 18ths of sapphire colored segments, and

175
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,760
5 18ths of emerald colored segments.

176
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,000
An important but somewhat subtle point here is that if you can solve the continuous variant,

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,900
you can also solve the original discrete version.

178
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,920
To see this, let's say you did find a fair division whose cuts didn't happen to fall

179
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,120
cleanly between the jewels, maybe it cuts only part way through an emerald segment.

180
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,240
Well, because this is a fair division, the length of emerald in both top and bottom has

181
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,160
to add up to 5 total emerald segments, a whole number multiple of the segment lengths.

182
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,680
So even if the division cut partially into an emerald segment on the left, it has to

183
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,080
cut partially into an emerald segment on the right, and more specifically in such a way

184
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,280
that the total length adds up to a whole number multiple of the segment length.

185
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,080
What that means is that you can adjust each cut without affecting the division so that

186
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,240
they ultimately do line up on the 1 18th marks.

187
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Now why are we doing all this?

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,800
Well in the continuous case, where you can cut wherever you want on this line, think

189
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,880
about all of the choices going into dividing the necklace and allocating the pieces.

190
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,380
First you choose two locations to cut the interval, but another way to think about that

191
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,240
is to choose three positive numbers that add up to one.

192
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,240
For example, maybe you choose 1 6th, 1 3rd, and 1 half, which correspond to these two

193
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,560
cuts.

194
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,320
Any time you find three positive numbers that add up to one, it gives you a way to cut the

195
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,600
necklace, and vice versa.

196
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,760
After that, you have to make a binary choice for each of these pieces, for whether it goes

197
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,520
to thief 1 or thief 2.

198
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,800
Now compare that to if I asked you to choose some arbitrary point on a sphere in three

199
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,980
dimensional space, some point with coordinates x, y, z, so that x2 plus y2 plus z2 equals

200
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
1.

201
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,260
Well, you might start off by choosing three positive numbers that add to one.

202
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,540
Maybe you want x2 to be 1 6th, y2 to be 1 3rd, and z2 to be 1 half.

203
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,180
Then you have to make a binary choice for each one of them, choosing whether to take

204
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,360
the positive square root or the negative square root, in a way that's completely parallel

205
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,260
to dividing the necklace and allocating the pieces.

206
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,480
Alright, hang with me now, because this is the key observation of the whole video.

207
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,560
It gives a correspondence between points on the sphere and necklace divisions.

208
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,460
For any point x, y, z on the sphere, because x2 plus y2 plus z2 is 1, you can cut the necklace

209
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,200
so that the first piece has a length x2, the second has a length y2, and the third has

210
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
a length z2.

211
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,260
For that first piece, if x is positive, give it to thief 1, otherwise give it to thief

212
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
2.

213
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,000
For the second piece, if y is positive, give it to thief 1, otherwise give it to thief

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,440
2, and likewise give the third piece to thief 1 if z is positive, and to thief 2 if z is

215
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
negative.

216
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,760
And you could go the other way around.

217
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,360
Any way that you divide up the necklace and divvy up the pieces gives us a unique point

218
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
on the sphere.

219
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,620
It's as if the sphere is a weirdly perfect way to encapsulate the idea of all possible

220
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,540
necklace divisions, just with a geometric object.

221
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,000
And here we are tantalizingly close.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
Think of the meaning of antipodal points under this association.

223
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,660
If the point x, y, z on the sphere corresponds to some necklace allocation, what does the

224
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,680
point negative x, negative y, and negative z correspond to?

225
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,200
Well, the squares of these three coordinates are the same, so each one corresponds to making

226
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,460
the same cuts on the necklace.

227
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,740
The difference is that every piece switches which thief it belongs to.

228
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,660
So jumping to an antipodal point on the opposite side of the sphere corresponds with exchanging

229
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,280
the pieces.

230
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,880
Now remember what it is that we're actually looking for.

231
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,340
We want the total length of each jewel type belonging to thief 1 to equal that for thief

232
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,080
2.

233
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,120
Or in other words, in a fair division, performing this antipodal swap doesn't change the amount

234
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,800
of each jewel belonging to each thief.

235
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,040
Your brain should be burning with the thought of Borsuk-Ulam at this point.

236
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Specifically, you might construct a function that takes in a given necklace allocation

237
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,040
and spits out two numbers, the total length of sapphire belonging to thief 1, and the

238
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,280
total length of emerald belonging to thief 1.

239
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,040
We want to show that there must exist a way to divide the necklace with two cuts and divvy

240
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,720
up the pieces so that these two numbers are the same as what they would be for thief 2,

241
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,940
or, said differently, where swapping all of the pieces wouldn't change those two numbers.

242
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,840
Because of this back and forth between necklace allocations and the points of the sphere,

243
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,600
and because pairs of numbers correspond with points on the xy plane, this is, in effect,

244
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
a map from the sphere onto the plane.

245
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,720
And the animation you're looking at right now is that literal map for the necklace I

246
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,000
was showing.

247
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,480
So the Borsuk-Ulam theorem guarantees that some antipodal pair of points on the sphere

248
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,200
land on each other in the plane, which means there must be some necklace division using

249
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,040
two cuts that gives a fair division between the thieves.

250
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,160
That, my friends, is what beautiful math feels like.

251
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,240
Alright, and if you're anything like me, you're just basking in the glow of what

252
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,600
a clever proof that is, and it might be easy to forget that what we actually want to solve

253
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,000
is the more general stolen necklace problem with any number of jewel types.

254
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,940
Luckily, we've now done 95% of the work, generalizing is pretty brief.

255
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,860
The main thing to mention is that there is a more general version of the Borsuk-Ulam

256
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,660
theorem, one that applies to higher dimensional spheres.

257
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,220
As an example, Borsuk-Ulam applies to mapping hyperspheres in 40-space into 3 dimensions.

258
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,620
And what I mean by a hypersphere is the set of all possible lists of four coordinates

259
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,660
where the sum of their squares equals 1.

260
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,620
Those are the points in 40-space a distance 1 from the origin.

261
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,460
Borsuk-Ulam says that if you try to map that set, all those special quadruplets of numbers,

262
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,380
into 3-dimensional space, continuously associating each one with some triplet of numbers, there

263
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,460
must be some antipodal collision, an input x1, x2, x3, x4, where flipping all of the

264
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,340
signs wouldn't change the output.

265
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,540
I'll leave it to you to pause and ponder and think about how this could apply to the

266
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,500
3-jewel case, and about what the general statement of Borsuk-Ulam might be, and how it applies

267
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
to the general necklace problem.

268
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,300
And maybe, just maybe, this gives you an inkling of why mathematicians care about things like

269
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,020
higher dimensional spheres, regardless of whether or not they exist in physical reality.

270
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,840
It's not always about the sphere per se, it's about what other problems in math they

271
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,100
can be used to encode.
