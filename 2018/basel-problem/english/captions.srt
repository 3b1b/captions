1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,745
Take 1 plus 1 fourth plus 1 ninth plus 1 sixteenth and so on 

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:09,723
where you're adding the inverses of the next square number What 

3
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:14,780
does this sum approach as you keep adding on more and more terms?

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,347
Now this is a challenge that remained unsolved for 90 years 

5
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:22,915
after it was initially posed until finally it was Euler who 

6
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:26,840
found the answer Super surprisingly to be pi squared divided by 6.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,460
I mean isn't that crazy?

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,900
What is pi doing here?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,060
And why is it squared?

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,703
We don't usually see it squared in honor of Euler whose hometown was basil This infinite 

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:41,962
sum is often referred to as the basil problem But the proof that I'd like to show you 

12
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:47,467
is very different from the one that Euler had I've said in a previous video that whenever 

13
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:52,910
you see pi show up There will be some connection to circles and there are those who like 

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,292
to say that pi is not fundamentally about circles and Insisting on connecting equations 

15
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:03,429
like these ones with a geometric intuition stems from a stubborn insistence on only 

16
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,627
understanding pi in the context where we first discovered it and That's all well and 

17
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:14,009
good But whatever your own perspective holds as fundamental the fact is pi is very much 

18
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:19,330
tied to circles So if you see it show up there will be a path somewhere in the massive 

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,712
interconnected web of mathematics Leading you back to circles and geometry The question 

20
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:30,094
is just how long and convoluted that path might be and in the case of the basil problem 

21
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:35,354
It's a lot shorter than you might first think and it all starts with light Here's the 

22
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:40,797
basic idea Imagine standing at the origin of a positive number line and putting a little 

23
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:45,873
lighthouse on all of the positive integers one two three four and so on that first 

24
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:51,132
lighthouse has some Apparent brightness from your point of view some amount of energy 

25
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:56,209
that your eye is receiving from the light per unit time and Let's just call that a 

26
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:01,652
brightness of one For reasons I'll explain shortly the apparent brightness of the second 

27
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:07,034
lighthouse is 1 fourth as much as the first and the apparent brightness of the third is 

28
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:12,354
1 9th as much as the first and then 1 16th and so on and you can probably see why this 

29
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:17,614
is useful for the basil problem It gives us a physical representation of what's being 

30
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:23,057
asked Since the brightness received from the whole infinite line of lighthouses is going 

31
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:28,378
to be 1 plus 1 4th plus 1 9th Plus the 16th and so on So the result that we are aiming 

32
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:33,515
to show is that this total brightness is equal to pi squared divided by 6 times the 

33
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:38,469
brightness of that first lighthouse And at first that might seem useless I mean, 

34
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:43,484
we're just re-asking the same original question But the progress comes from a new 

35
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:48,927
question that this framing raises are there ways that we can rearrange these lighthouses 

36
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:53,025
That don't change the total brightness for the observer And if so, 

37
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:58,407
can you show this to be equivalent to a setup that's somehow easier to compute To start 

38
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:03,728
let's be clear about what we mean when we reference apparent brightness to an observer 

39
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:09,232
Imagine a little screen which maybe represents the retina of your eye or a digital camera 

40
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:14,492
sensor or something like that You could ask what proportion of the rays coming out of 

41
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:19,568
the source hit that screen or phrase differently What is the angle between the ray 

42
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:23,360
hitting the bottom of that screen and the ray hitting the top?

43
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,500
Or rather since we should be thinking of these lights as being in three dimensions.

44
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,254
It might be more accurate to ask What is the angle the 

45
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:33,260
light covers in both directions perpendicular to the source?

46
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,525
In spherical geometry you sometimes talk about the solid angle of a shape Which is the 

47
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:43,791
proportion of a sphere it covers as viewed from a given point You see the first of two 

48
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:48,996
places this story we're thinking of screens is going to be useful is in understanding 

49
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:54,262
the inverse square law Which is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon think of all 

50
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:59,467
of the rays of light hitting a screen one unit away from the source as You double the 

51
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:04,794
distance those rays will now cover an area with twice the width and twice the height So 

52
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:09,817
it would take four copies of that original screen to receive the same rays at that 

53
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:15,204
distance And so each individual one receives 1 fourth as much light This is the sense in 

54
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:20,651
which I mean a light would appear 1 fourth as bright two times the distance away Likewise 

55
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:25,978
when you're three times farther away You would need nine copies of that original screen 

56
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:31,365
to receive the same rays so each individual screen only receives 1 9th as much light and 

57
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:36,570
This pattern continues because the area hit by a light increases by the square of the 

58
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,836
distance the brightness of that light decreases by the inverse square of that distance 

59
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:47,162
and As I'm sure many of you know this inverse square law is not at all special to light 

60
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:52,488
It pops up whenever you have some kind of quantity that spreads out evenly from a point 

61
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:57,875
source whether that's sound or heat or a radio signal things like that and Remember it's 

62
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:03,141
because of this inverse square law that an infinite array of evenly spaced lighthouses 

63
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:08,346
physically implements the Basel problem But again what we need if we're going to make 

64
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:13,672
any progress here is to understand how we can manipulate setups with light sources like 

65
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:18,938
this without changing the total brightness for the observer and The key building block 

66
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:24,325
is an especially nice way to transform a single lighthouse into two Think of an observer 

67
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:29,772
at the origin of the XY plane and a single lighthouse sitting out somewhere on that plane 

68
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:35,159
Now draw a line from that lighthouse to the observer and then another line perpendicular 

69
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:40,425
to that one at the lighthouse Now place two lighthouses where this new line intersects 

70
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:45,751
the coordinate axes Which I'll go ahead and call lighthouse a over here on the left and 

71
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:50,957
lighthouse B on the upper side It turns out and you'll see why this is true in just a 

72
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:56,283
minute the brightness that the observer Experiences from that first lighthouse is equal 

73
00:05:56,283 --> 00:06:01,488
to the combined brightness experienced from lighthouses A and B together And I should 

74
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:06,935
say by the way that the standing assumption throughout this video is that all lighthouses 

75
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:12,322
are equivalent They're using the same light bulb emanating the same power all of that So 

76
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:17,346
in other words assigning variables to things here if we call the distance from the 

77
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:22,491
observer to lighthouse a little a and The distance from the observer to lighthouse B 

78
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:27,938
little B and the distance to the first lighthouse H We have the relation 1 over a squared 

79
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:33,204
plus 1 over B squared equals 1 over H squared This is the much less well-known Inverse 

80
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:38,470
Pythagorean theorem which some of you may recognize from math ologer's most recent and 

81
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,856
I'll say most excellent video on the many cousins of the Pythagorean theorem Pretty cool 

82
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:49,304
relation don't you think and if you're a mathematician at heart you might be asking right 

83
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:54,327
now how you prove it and There are some straightforward ways where you express the 

84
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:59,714
triangles area in two separate ways and apply the usual Pythagorean theorem But there is 

85
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:04,980
another quite pretty method that I'd like to briefly outline here that falls much more 

86
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,306
nicely into our storyline because again It uses intuitions of light and screens Imagine 

87
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:15,633
scaling down the whole right triangle into a tinier version and think of this miniature 

88
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:20,777
Hypotenuse as a screen receiving light from the first lighthouse If you reshape that 

89
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:26,043
screen to be the combination of the two legs of the miniature triangle like this Well, 

90
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:29,070
it still receives the same amount of light, right?

91
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,890
I mean the rays of light hitting one of those two legs are precisely the same as the rays 

92
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,886
that hit the hypotenuse Then the key is that the amount of light from the first 

93
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:45,319
lighthouse that hits this left side the limited angle of rays that end up hitting that 

94
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,628
screen is Exactly the same as the amount of light over here coming from lighthouse a 

95
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:55,936
which hits that side it'll be the same angle of rays and Symmetrically the amount of 

96
00:07:55,936 --> 00:08:01,369
light from the first house hitting the bottom portion of our screen is The same as the 

97
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:06,303
amount of light hitting that portion from lighthouse B Why you might ask well, 

98
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:11,923
it's a matter of similar triangles This animation already gives you a strong hint for how 

99
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:17,356
it works And we've also left a link in the description to a simple GeoGebra applet for 

100
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:22,789
those of you who want to think this through in a slightly more interactive environment 

101
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,285
and in playing with that One important fact here that you'll be able to see is that the 

102
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:33,593
similar triangles only apply in the limiting case for a very tiny screen The inverse 

103
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:39,151
Pythagorean theorem Alright buckle up now because here's where things get good We've got 

104
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,650
this inverse Pythagorean theorem, right?

105
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,960
And that's going to let us transform a single lighthouse into two others without 

106
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,116
changing the brightness experienced by the observer With that in hand and no small 

107
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:57,146
amount of cleverness we can use this to build up the infinite array that we need 

108
00:08:57,146 --> 00:09:02,426
Picture yourself at the edge of a circular lake directly opposite a lighthouse We're 

109
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:07,829
going to want it to be the case that the distance between you and the lighthouse Along 

110
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,985
the border of the lake is one so we'll say the lake has a circumference of two now 

111
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:18,202
the apparent brightness is one divided by the diameter squared and In this case the 

112
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:23,419
diameter is that circumference 2 divided by pi so the apparent brightness works out 

113
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,823
to be pi squared divided by 4 Now for our first transformation draw a new circle twice 

114
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:34,164
as big so circumference 4 and Draw a tangent line to the top of the small circle then 

115
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:39,443
replace the original lighthouse with two new ones where this tangent line intersects 

116
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:44,661
the larger circle an Important fact from geometry that we'll be using over and over 

117
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:49,940
here Is that if you take the diameter of a circle and form a triangle with any point 

118
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,810
on the circle?

119
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,695
The angle at that new point will always be 90 degrees the significance of that in our 

120
00:09:56,695 --> 00:10:02,247
diagram here is that it means the inverse Pythagorean theorem applies and the brightness 

121
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:07,862
from those two new lighthouses equals the brightness from the first one namely pi squared 

122
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:12,853
divided by 4 as The next step draw a new circle twice as big as the last with a 

123
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:18,156
circumference 8 Now for each lighthouse take a line from that lighthouse through the 

124
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:23,647
top of the smaller circle Which is the center of the larger circle and consider the two 

125
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:27,328
points where that intersects with the larger circle Again, 

126
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:32,631
since this line is a diameter of that large circle Then the lines from those two new 

127
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:38,183
points to the observer are going to form a right angle Likewise by looking at this right 

128
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:43,549
triangle here whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the smaller circle You can see that 

129
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:48,914
the line from the observer to that original lighthouse is at a right angle With a new 

130
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,410
long line that we drew Good news, right?

131
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,249
because that means we can apply the inverse Pythagorean theorem and that means 

132
00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:00,713
that the apparent brightness from the original lighthouse is the same as the 

133
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:04,133
combined brightness from the two newer ones and Of course, 

134
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,597
you can do that same thing over on the other side drawing a line through the 

135
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:13,176
top of the smaller circle and getting two new lighthouses on the larger circle 

136
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:17,756
and Even nicer these four lighthouses are all going to be evenly spaced around 

137
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:18,510
the lake Why?

138
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,843
Well, the lines from those lighthouses to the center are at 90 degree angles with each 

139
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:30,352
other So since things are symmetric left to right that means that the distances along 

140
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:35,732
the circumference are 1, 2, 2, 2, and 1 Alright, you might see where this is going, 

141
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:41,434
but I want to walk through this for just one more step You draw a circle twice as big so 

142
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:46,878
circumference of 16 now and for each lighthouse You draw a line from that lighthouse 

143
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:52,516
through the top of the smaller circle Which is the center of the bigger circle and then 

144
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:57,960
create two new lighthouses where that line intersects with the larger circle Just as 

145
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,534
before because the long line is a diameter of the big circle those two new lighthouses 

146
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:09,299
make a right angle with the observer, right and Just as before the line from the observer 

147
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:15,000
to the original lighthouse is Perpendicular to the long line and those are the two facts 

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,637
that justify us in using the inverse Pythagorean theorem But what might not be as clear 

149
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:26,402
is that when you do this for all of the lighthouses to get eight new ones on the Big lake 

150
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:31,719
those eight new lighthouses are going to be evenly spaced This is the final bit of 

151
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:37,356
geometry proofiness before the final thrust To see this remember that if you draw lines 

152
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:43,121
from two adjacent lighthouses on the small lake to the center They make a 90 degree angle 

153
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:48,758
If instead you draw lines to a point anywhere on the circumference of the circle that's 

154
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:54,524
not between them the very useful inscribed angle theorem from geometry tells us that this 

155
00:12:54,524 --> 00:13:00,225
will be Exactly half of the angle that they make with the center in this case 45 degrees 

156
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:05,926
But when we position that new point at the top of the lake These are the two lines which 

157
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:11,435
define the position of the new lighthouses on the larger lake What that means then is 

158
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:16,944
that when you draw lines from those eight new lighthouses into the center They divide 

159
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:22,517
the circle evenly into 45 degree angle pieces and that means the eight lighthouses are 

160
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:28,218
evenly spaced around the circumference with the distance of two between each one of them 

161
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:33,983
and Now just imagine this thing playing on at every step doubling the size of each circle 

162
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:39,684
and Transforming each lighthouse into two new ones along a line drawn through the center 

163
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:45,257
of the larger circle at every step the apparent brightness to the observer remains the 

164
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:50,895
same pi squared over 4 and at every step the lighthouse has remained evenly spaced with 

165
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:56,468
a distance 2 between each one of them on the circumference and In the limit what we're 

166
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:01,912
getting here is a flat horizontal line with an infinite number of lighthouses evenly 

167
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:07,550
spaced in both directions and Because the apparent brightness was pi squared over 4 the 

168
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,866
entire way that will also be true in this limiting case And This gives us a pretty 

169
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:18,439
awesome infinite series the sum of the inverse squares 1 over n squared Where n covers 

170
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:24,141
all of the odd integers 1 3 5 and so on but also negative 1 negative 3 negative 5 off in 

171
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:29,521
the leftward direction Adding all of those up is going to give us pi squared over 4 

172
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:35,030
That's amazing and it's the core of what I want to show you and Just take a step back 

173
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:40,539
and think about how unreal this seems The sum of simple fractions that at first sight 

174
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:46,112
have nothing to do with geometry nothing to do with circles at all Apparently gives us 

175
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:51,750
this result that's related to pi Except now you can actually see what it has to do with 

176
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,387
geometry the number line is kind of like a limit of ever-growing circles and As you sum 

177
00:14:57,387 --> 00:15:02,960
across that number line making sure to sum all the way to infinity on either side It's 

178
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,725
sort of like you're adding up along the boundary of an infinitely large circle and a very 

179
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:14,362
loose But very fun way of speaking But wait, you might say this is not the sum that you 

180
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:18,270
promised us at the start of the video And well, you're right.

181
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,146
We do have a little bit of thinking left First things first, 

182
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:27,072
let's just restrict the sum to only being the positive odd numbers which gets us pi 

183
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:32,291
squared divided by 8 Now the only difference between this and the sum that we're looking 

184
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:37,392
for that goes over all the positive integers odd and even is That it's missing the sum 

185
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:42,611
of the reciprocals of even numbers what I'm coloring in red up here Now you can think of 

186
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:47,361
that missing series as a scaled copy of the total series that we want Where each 

187
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:52,521
lighthouse moves to being twice as far away from the origin one gets shifted to two two 

188
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:57,388
gets shifted to four three gets shifted to six and so on and Because that involves 

189
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:59,910
doubling the distance for every lighthouse.

190
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:05,086
it means that the apparent brightness would be decreased by a factor of four and That's 

191
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:10,243
also relatively straightforward algebra going from the sum over all the integers to the 

192
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:15,224
sum over the even integers Involves multiplying by 1 4th and what that means is that 

193
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:20,205
going from all the integers to the odd ones Would be multiplying by 3 4ths since the 

194
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:25,361
evens plus the odds have to give us the whole thing So if we just flip that around that 

195
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:30,284
means going from the sum over the odd numbers to the sum over all positive integers 

196
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:35,558
requires multiplying by 4 thirds So taking that pi squared over 8 multiplying by 4 thirds 

197
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:40,773
badda boom badda bing We've got ourselves a solution to the basil problem Now this video 

198
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:45,812
that you just watched was primarily written and animated by one of the new three blue 

199
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:49,563
one brown team members Ben Hambricht an addition made possible.
