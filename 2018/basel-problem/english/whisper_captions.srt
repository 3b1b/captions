1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,060
Take 1 plus 1 fourth plus 1 ninth plus 1 sixteenth and so on where you're adding the inverses of the next square number

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,780
What does this sum approach as you keep adding on more and more terms?

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:23,240
Now this is a challenge that remained unsolved for 90 years after it was initially posed until finally it was Euler who found the answer

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,900
Super surprisingly to be pi squared divided by 6. I mean isn't that crazy? What is pi doing here?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,400
And why is it squared? We don't usually see it squared in honor of Euler whose hometown was basil

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,860
This infinite sum is often referred to as the basil problem

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,920
But the proof that I'd like to show you is very different from the one that Euler had

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,000
I've said in a previous video that whenever you see pi show up

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,860
There will be some connection to circles and there are those who like to say that pi is not fundamentally about circles and

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,780
Insisting on connecting equations like these ones with a geometric intuition

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,560
stems from a stubborn insistence on only understanding pi in the context where we first discovered it and

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,260
That's all well and good

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,480
But whatever your own perspective holds as fundamental the fact is pi is very much tied to circles

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,680
So if you see it show up there will be a path somewhere in the massive interconnected web of mathematics

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
Leading you back to circles and geometry

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,160
The question is just how long and convoluted that path might be and in the case of the basil problem

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,780
It's a lot shorter than you might first think and it all starts with light

18
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,780
Here's the basic idea

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,120
Imagine standing at the origin of a positive number line and putting a little lighthouse on all of the positive integers one two

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,320
three four and so on that first lighthouse has some

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,560
Apparent brightness from your point of view some amount of energy that your eye is receiving from the light per unit time and

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,400
Let's just call that a brightness of one

23
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,740
For reasons I'll explain shortly

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,540
the apparent brightness of the second lighthouse is

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,240
1 fourth as much as the first and the apparent brightness of the third is 1 9th as much as the first and then

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,380
1 16th and so on and you can probably see why this is useful for the basil problem

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,320
It gives us a physical representation of what's being asked

28
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,120
Since the brightness received from the whole infinite line of lighthouses is going to be 1 plus 1 4th plus 1 9th

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,900
Plus the 16th and so on

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,260
So the result that we are aiming to show is that this total brightness is equal to pi squared divided by 6

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,940
times the brightness of that first lighthouse

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,960
And at first that might seem useless

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,620
I mean, we're just re-asking the same original question

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:48,120
But the progress comes from a new question that this framing raises are there ways that we can rearrange these lighthouses

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,020
That don't change the total brightness for the observer

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,040
And if so, can you show this to be equivalent to a setup that's somehow easier to compute

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,820
To start let's be clear about what we mean when we reference apparent brightness to an observer

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Imagine a little screen which maybe represents the retina of your eye or a digital camera sensor or something like that

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,100
You could ask what proportion of the rays coming out of the source hit that screen or phrase differently

40
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,360
What is the angle between the ray hitting the bottom of that screen and the ray hitting the top?

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,140
Or rather since we should be thinking of these lights as being in three dimensions. It might be more accurate to ask

42
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,260
What is the angle the light covers in both directions perpendicular to the source?

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,720
In spherical geometry you sometimes talk about the solid angle of a shape

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,500
Which is the proportion of a sphere it covers as viewed from a given point

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,680
You see the first of two places this story we're thinking of screens is going to be useful is in understanding the inverse square law

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,160
Which is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,960
think of all of the rays of light hitting a screen one unit away from the source as

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,740
You double the distance those rays will now cover an area with twice the width and twice the height

49
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:08,100
So it would take four copies of that original screen to receive the same rays at that distance

50
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,760
And so each individual one receives 1 fourth as much light

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,600
This is the sense in which I mean a light would appear 1 fourth as bright two times the distance away

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,180
Likewise when you're three times farther away

53
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,500
You would need nine copies of that original screen to receive the same rays

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,520
so each individual screen only receives 1 9th as much light and

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,540
This pattern continues because the area hit by a light increases by the square of the distance the brightness of that light

56
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,180
decreases by the inverse square of that distance and

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,080
As I'm sure many of you know this inverse square law is not at all special to light

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,900
It pops up whenever you have some kind of quantity that spreads out evenly from a point source

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:57,040
whether that's sound or heat or radio signal things like that and

60
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,360
Infinite array of evenly spaced lighthouses physically implements the basel problem

61
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,920
But again what we need if we're going to make any progress here is to understand how we can

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,370
manipulate setups with light sources like this without changing the total brightness for the observer and

63
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,050
The key building block is an especially nice way to transform a single lighthouse into two

64
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,530
Think

65
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,110
Of an observer at the origin of the XY plane and a single lighthouse sitting out somewhere on that plane

66
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,690
Now draw a line from that lighthouse to the observer and then another line

67
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,070
perpendicular to that one at the lighthouse

68
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,490
Now place two lighthouses where this new line

69
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,210
intersects the coordinate axes

70
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,950
Which I'll go ahead and call lighthouse a over here on the left and lighthouse B on the upper side

71
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,370
It turns out and you'll see why this is true in just a minute the brightness that the observer

72
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:59,810
Experiences from that first lighthouse is equal to the combined brightness experienced from lighthouses A and B together

73
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,610
And I should say by the way that the standing assumption throughout this video is that all lighthouses are equivalent

74
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,490
They're using the same light bulb emanating the same power all of that

75
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,810
So in other words assigning variables to things here if we call the distance from the observer to lighthouse a little a

76
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,110
And the distance from the observer to lighthouse B little B and the distance to the first lighthouse H

77
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,790
We have the relation 1 over a squared plus 1 over b squared equals 1 over h squared

78
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,790
This is the much less well-known

79
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:40,570
Inverse Pythagorean theorem which some of you may recognize from math ologer's most recent and I'll say most excellent

80
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,590
video on the many cousins of the Pythagorean theorem

81
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,490
Pretty cool relation don't you think and

82
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,630
if you're a mathematician at heart you might be asking right now how you prove it and

83
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:58,090
There are some straightforward ways where you express the triangles area in two separate ways and apply the usual Pythagorean theorem

84
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:05,890
But there is another quite pretty method that I'd like to briefly outline here that falls much more nicely into our storyline because again

85
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,650
It uses intuitions of light and screens

86
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,030
Imagine scaling down the whole right triangle into a tinier version and think of this miniature

87
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,790
Hypotenuse as a screen receiving light from the first lighthouse

88
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:26,070
If you reshape that screen to be the combination of the two legs of the miniature triangle like this

89
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,070
Well, it still receives the same amount of light, right?

90
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,650
I mean the rays of light hitting one of those two legs are precisely the same as the rays that hit the hypotenuse

91
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,510
Then the key is that the amount of light from the first lighthouse that hits this left side

92
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,370
the limited angle of rays that end up hitting that screen is

93
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,870
Exactly the same as the amount of light over here coming from lighthouse a which hits that side

94
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,490
it'll be the same angle of rays and

95
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,010
Symmetrically the amount of light from the first house hitting the bottom portion of our screen is

96
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:08,010
The same as the amount of light hitting that portion from lighthouse B

97
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,470
Why you might ask well, it's a matter of similar triangles

98
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,650
This animation already gives you a strong hint for how it works

99
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,470
And we've also left a link in the description to a simple

100
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,310
GeoGebra applet for those of you who want to think this through in a slightly more interactive environment and in playing with that

101
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:31,450
One important fact here that you'll be able to see is that the similar triangles only apply in the limiting case for a very tiny

102
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,970
screen

103
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,070
The inverse Pythagorean theorem

104
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,230
Alright buckle up now because here's where things get good

105
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,650
We've got this inverse Pythagorean theorem, right?

106
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,610
And that's going to let us transform a single lighthouse into two others without changing the brightness

107
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,030
experienced by the observer

108
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:55,170
With that in hand and no small amount of cleverness we can use this to build up the infinite array that we need

109
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,350
Picture yourself at the edge of a circular lake directly opposite a lighthouse

110
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,630
We're going to want it to be the case that the distance between you and the lighthouse

111
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,410
Along the border of the lake is one so we'll say the lake has a circumference of two

112
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,950
now the apparent brightness is one divided by the diameter squared and

113
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,310
In this case the diameter is that circumference 2 divided by pi so the apparent brightness works out to be

114
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,310
pi squared divided by 4

115
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:31,630
Now for our first transformation draw a new circle twice as big so circumference 4 and

116
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,310
Draw a tangent line to the top of the small circle

117
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,150
then replace the original lighthouse with two new ones where this tangent line intersects the larger circle an

118
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,250
Important fact from geometry that we'll be using over and over here

119
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,810
Is that if you take the diameter of a circle and form a triangle with any point on the circle?

120
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,570
The angle at that new point will always be 90 degrees

121
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,710
the significance of that in our diagram here is that it means the inverse Pythagorean theorem applies and

122
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:08,710
the brightness from those two new lighthouses equals the brightness from the first one namely pi squared divided by 4 as

123
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,090
The next step draw a new circle twice as big as the last with a circumference 8

124
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:19,330
Now for each lighthouse take a line from that lighthouse through the top of the smaller circle

125
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,150
Which is the center of the larger circle and consider the two points where that intersects with the larger circle

126
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,090
Again, since this line is a diameter of that large circle

127
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,850
Then the lines from those two new points to the observer are going to form a right angle

128
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,530
Likewise by looking at this right triangle here whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the smaller circle

129
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,830
You can see that the line from the observer to that original lighthouse is at a right angle

130
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,590
With a new long line that we drew

131
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,410
Good news, right?

132
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:59,190
because that means we can apply the inverse Pythagorean theorem and that means that the apparent brightness from the original lighthouse is the same as

133
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,130
the combined brightness from the two newer ones and

134
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,570
Of course, you can do that same thing over on the other side

135
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,110
drawing a line through the top of the smaller circle and getting two new lighthouses on the larger circle and

136
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,730
Even nicer these four lighthouses are all going to be evenly spaced around the lake

137
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,510
Why?

138
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,230
Well, the lines from those lighthouses to the center are at 90 degree angles with each other

139
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:33,550
So since things are symmetric left to right that means that the distances along the circumference are 1, 2, 2, 2, and 1

140
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,570
Alright, you might see where this is going, but I want to walk through this for just one more step

141
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,650
You draw a circle twice as big so circumference of 16 now and for each lighthouse

142
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,790
You draw a line from that lighthouse through the top of the smaller circle

143
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:57,210
Which is the center of the bigger circle and then create two new lighthouses where that line intersects with the larger circle

144
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,570
Just as before because the long line is a diameter of the big circle

145
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,930
those two new lighthouses make a right angle with the observer, right and

146
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,850
Just as before the line from the observer to the original lighthouse is

147
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:19,250
Perpendicular to the long line and those are the two facts that justify us in using the inverse Pythagorean theorem

148
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,890
But what might not be as clear is that when you do this for all of the lighthouses to get eight new ones on the

149
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,690
Big lake those eight new lighthouses are going to be evenly spaced

150
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,790
This is the final bit of geometry proofiness before the final thrust

151
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,430
To see this remember that if you draw lines from two adjacent lighthouses on the small lake to the center

152
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,390
They make a 90 degree angle

153
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:51,070
If instead you draw lines to a point anywhere on the circumference of the circle that's not between them the very useful

154
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,830
inscribed angle theorem from geometry tells us that this will be

155
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:00,090
Exactly half of the angle that they make with the center in this case 45 degrees

156
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,710
But when we position that new point at the top of the lake

157
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,870
These are the two lines which define the position of the new lighthouses on the larger lake

158
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,530
What that means then is that when you draw lines from those eight new lighthouses into the center

159
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,670
They divide the circle evenly into 45 degree angle pieces

160
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:29,130
and that means the eight lighthouses are evenly spaced around the circumference with the distance of two between each one of them and

161
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:35,310
Now just imagine this thing playing on at every step doubling the size of each circle and

162
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,630
Transforming each lighthouse into two new ones along a line drawn through the center of the larger circle

163
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,090
at every step the apparent brightness to the observer remains the same pi squared over 4 and

164
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,670
at every step the lighthouse has remained evenly spaced with a distance 2 between each one of them on the circumference and

165
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,590
In the limit what we're getting here is a flat horizontal line with an infinite number of lighthouses

166
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,950
evenly spaced in both directions and

167
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:10,650
Because the apparent brightness was pi squared over 4 the entire way that will also be true in this limiting case

168
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,450
And

169
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,630
This gives us a pretty awesome infinite series the sum of the inverse squares 1 over n squared

170
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:26,730
Where n covers all of the odd integers 1 3 5 and so on but also negative 1 negative 3 negative 5 off in the leftward direction

171
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,330
Adding all of those up is going to give us pi squared over 4

172
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,910
That's amazing and it's the core of what I want to show you and

173
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,470
Just take a step back and think about how unreal this seems

174
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:43,590
The sum of simple fractions that at first sight have nothing to do with geometry nothing to do with circles at all

175
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,890
Apparently gives us this result that's related to pi

176
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,790
Except now you can actually see what it has to do with geometry

177
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,470
the number line is kind of like a limit of ever-growing circles and

178
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,670
As you sum across that number line making sure to sum all the way to infinity on either side

179
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:08,230
It's sort of like you're adding up along the boundary of an infinitely large circle and a very loose

180
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,330
But very fun way of speaking

181
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,850
But wait, you might say this is not the sum that you promised us at the start of the video

182
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,150
And well, you're right. We do have a little bit of thinking left

183
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:27,150
First things first, let's just restrict the sum to only being the positive odd numbers which gets us pi squared divided by 8

184
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:34,570
Now the only difference between this and the sum that we're looking for that goes over all the positive integers odd and even is

185
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,990
That it's missing the sum of the reciprocals of even numbers what I'm coloring in red up here

186
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:46,370
Now you can think of that missing series as a scaled copy of the total series that we want

187
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:53,410
Where each lighthouse moves to being twice as far away from the origin one gets shifted to two two gets shifted to four

188
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,950
three gets shifted to six and so on and

189
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:04,810
Because that involves doubling the distance for every lighthouse. It means that the apparent brightness would be decreased by a factor of four and

190
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,230
That's also relatively straightforward algebra going from the sum over all the integers to the sum over the even integers

191
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,330
Involves multiplying by 1 4th

192
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,890
And what that means is that going from all the integers to the odd ones would be multiplying by 3 4ths

193
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,210
Since the evens plus the odds have to give us the whole thing

194
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:30,090
So if we just flip that around that means going from the sum over the odd numbers to the sum over all positive integers

195
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,590
requires multiplying by 4 thirds

196
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,830
So taking that pi squared over 8 multiplying by 4 thirds bada boom bada bing

197
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,390
We've got ourselves a solution to the basil problem

198
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:49,230
Now this video that you just watched was primarily written and animated by one of the new three blue one brown team members Ben Hambricht
