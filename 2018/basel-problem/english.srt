1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Take 1 plus 1 fourth plus 1 ninth plus 1 sixteenth and so on where you're adding the inverses of the next square number

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,500
What does this sum approach as you keep adding on more and more terms?

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:23,120
Now this is a challenge that remained unsolved for 90 years after it was initially posed until finally it was Euler who found the answer

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,820
Super surprisingly to be pi squared divided by 6. I mean isn't that crazy? What is pi doing here?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,440
And why is it squared? We don't usually see it squared in honor of Euler whose hometown was basil

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,820
This infinite sum is often referred to as the basil problem

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,800
But the proof that I'd like to show you is very different from the one that Euler had

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,820
I've said in a previous video that whenever you see pi show up

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,640
There will be some connection to circles and there are those who like to say that pi is not fundamentally about circles and

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,500
Insisting on connecting equations like these ones with a geometric intuition

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,300
stems from a stubborn insistence on only understanding pi in the context where we first discovered it and

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,120
That's all well and good

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,440
But whatever your own perspective holds as fundamental the fact is pi is very much tied to circles

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,260
So if you see it show up there will be a path somewhere in the massive interconnected web of mathematics

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,940
Leading you back to circles and geometry

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,200
The question is just how long and convoluted that path might be and in the case of the basil problem

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,560
It's a lot shorter than you might first think and it all starts with light

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,040
Here's the basic idea

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,760
Imagine standing at the origin of a positive number line and putting a little lighthouse on all of the positive integers one

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Two three four and so on

21
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,260
That first lighthouse has some

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,140
Apparent brightness from your point of view some amount of energy that your eye is receiving from the light per unit time

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,140
And let's just call that a brightness of one

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,540
For reasons I'll explain shortly

25
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,140
the apparent brightness of the second lighthouse is

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,520
1 fourth as much as the first and the apparent brightness of the third is

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,120
1 9th as much as the first and then 1 16th and so on and

28
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,100
You can probably see why this is useful for the basil problem it gives us a physical representation of what's being asked

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,760
Since the brightness received from the whole infinite line of lighthouses is going to be 1 plus 1 4th plus 1 9th

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Plus 1 16th and so on

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,180
So the result that we are aiming to show is that this total brightness is equal to pi squared divided by 6

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,780
times the brightness of that first lighthouse

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
And at first that might seem useless

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
I mean, we're just re-asking the same original question

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,920
But the progress comes from a new question that this framing raises are there ways that we can rearrange these lighthouses

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,880
That don't change the total brightness for the observer

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,920
And if so, can you show this to be equivalent to a setup that's somehow easier to compute?

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,640
To start let's be clear about what we mean when we reference apparent brightness to an observer

39
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,500
Imagine a little screen which maybe represents the retina of your eye or a digital camera sensor or something like that

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:18,060
You could ask what proportion of the rays coming out of the source hit that screen or phrase differently

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,020
what is the angle between the ray hitting the bottom of that screen and the ray hitting the top or

42
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,980
Rather since we should be thinking of these lights as being in three dimensions. It might be more accurate to ask

43
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,140
What is the angle the light covers in both directions perpendicular to the source?

44
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,560
In spherical geometry you sometimes talk about the solid angle of a shape

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Which is the proportion of a sphere it covers as viewed from a given point

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,360
You see the first of two places this story we're thinking of screens is going to be useful is in understanding the inverse square law

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Which is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,800
think of all of the rays of light hitting a screen one unit away from the source as

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,600
You double the distance those rays will now cover an area with twice the width and twice the height

50
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,040
So it would take four copies of that original screen to receive the same rays at that distance

51
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,560
And so each individual one receives 1 fourth as much light

52
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
This is the sense in which I mean a light would appear 1 fourth as bright two times the distance away

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,980
Likewise when you're three times farther away

54
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,340
You would need nine copies of that original screen to receive the same rays

55
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,300
so each individual screen only receives 1 9th as much light and

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,400
This pattern continues because the area hit by a light increases by the square of the distance the brightness of that light

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,960
decreases by the inverse square of that distance and

58
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,000
As I'm sure many of you know this inverse square law is not at all special to light

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,760
It pops up whenever you have some kind of quantity that spreads out evenly from a point source

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,040
whether that's sound or heat or a radio signal things like that and

61
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,320
Remember it's because of this inverse square law that an infinite array of evenly spaced lighthouses

62
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,120
physically implements the Basel problem

63
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,020
But again what we need if we're going to make any progress here is to understand how we can manipulate

64
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,240
setups with light sources like this without changing the total brightness for the observer and

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,000
The key building block is an especially nice way to transform a single lighthouse into two

66
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,980
Think of an observer at the origin of the XY plane and a single lighthouse sitting out somewhere on that plane

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,960
Now draw a line from that lighthouse to the observer and then another line perpendicular to that one at the lighthouse

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,360
Now place two lighthouses where this new line

69
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,320
intersects the coordinate axes

70
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,660
Which I'll go ahead and call lighthouse a over here on the left and lighthouse B on the upper side

71
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,280
It turns out and you'll see why this is true in just a minute the brightness that the observer

72
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,460
Experiences from that first lighthouse is equal to the combined brightness experienced from lighthouses A and B together

73
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,660
And I should say by the way that the standing assumption throughout this video is that all lighthouses are equivalent

74
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,100
They're using the same light bulb emanating the same power all of that

75
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,940
So in other words assigning variables to things here if we call the distance from the observer to lighthouse a little a and

76
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,720
The distance from the observer to lighthouse B little B and the distance to the first lighthouse H

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,700
We have the relation 1 over a squared plus 1 over B squared equals 1 over H squared

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
This is the much less well-known

79
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,360
Inverse Pythagorean theorem which some of you may recognize from math ologer's most recent and I'll say most excellent

80
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,360
video on the many cousins of the Pythagorean theorem

81
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Pretty cool relation don't you think and

82
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,340
if you're a mathematician at heart you might be asking right now how you prove it and

83
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,060
There are some straightforward ways where you express the triangles area in two separate ways and apply the usual Pythagorean theorem

84
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,820
But there is another quite pretty method that I'd like to briefly outline here that falls much more nicely into our storyline because again

85
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,340
It uses intuitions of light and screens

86
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,840
Imagine scaling down the whole right triangle into a tinier version and think of this miniature

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,600
Hypotenuse as a screen receiving light from the first lighthouse

88
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,620
If you reshape that screen to be the combination of the two legs of the miniature triangle like this

89
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,880
Well, it still receives the same amount of light, right?

90
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,520
I mean the rays of light hitting one of those two legs are precisely the same as the rays that hit the hypotenuse

91
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,340
Then the key is that the amount of light from the first lighthouse it hits this left side

92
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,220
the limited angle of rays that end up hitting that screen is

93
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,680
Exactly the same as the amount of light over here coming from lighthouse a which hits that side

94
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,000
it'll be the same angle of rays and

95
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,900
Symmetrically the amount of light from the first house hitting the bottom portion of our screen is

96
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,880
The same as the amount of light hitting that portion from lighthouse B

97
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,440
Why you might ask well, it's a matter of similar triangles

98
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,520
This animation already gives you a strong hint for how it works

99
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,040
And we've also left a link in the description to a simple GeoGebra applet for those of you who want to think this through in

100
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,760
a slightly more interactive environment and in playing with that one important fact here that you'll be able to see is that the similar

101
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,800
triangles only apply in the limiting case for a very tiny screen

102
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
All

103
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,100
Right buckle up now because here's where things get good

104
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,540
We've got this inverse Pythagorean theorem, right?

105
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,380
And that's going to let us transform a single lighthouse into two others without changing the brightness

106
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,940
Experienced by the observer with that in hand and no small amount of cleverness

107
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,660
We can use this to build up the infinite array that we need

108
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,260
Picture yourself at the edge of a circular lake directly opposite a lighthouse

109
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,400
We're gonna want it to be the case that the distance between you and the lighthouse

110
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,120
Along the border of the lake is one. So we'll say the lake has a circumference of two

111
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,060
now the apparent brightness is one divided by the diameter squared and in this case the diameter is that

112
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,160
circumference 2 divided by pi so the apparent brightness works out to be

113
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
pi squared divided by 4

114
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,180
Now for our first transformation draw a new circle twice as big so circumference 4 and

115
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,160
Draw a tangent line to the top of the small circle

116
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,140
then replace the original lighthouse with two new ones where this tangent line intersects the larger circle an

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,040
important fact from geometry that we'll be using over and over here is that if you take the diameter of a circle and form a

118
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,320
Triangle with any point on the circle the angle at that new point will always be 90 degrees

119
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,900
The significance of that in our diagram here is that it means the inverse

120
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,940
Pythagorean theorem applies and the brightness from those two new lighthouses

121
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,540
equals the brightness from the first one namely pi squared divided by 4 as

122
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,960
The next step draw a new circle twice as big as the last with a circumference 8

123
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,240
Now for each lighthouse take a line from that lighthouse through the top of the smaller circle

124
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,080
which is the center of the larger circle and

125
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
Consider the two points where that intersects with the larger circle

126
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,040
Again, since this line is a diameter of that large circle

127
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,960
Then the lines from those two new points to the observer are going to form a right angle

128
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,500
Likewise by looking at this right triangle here whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the smaller circle

129
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,540
You can see that the line from the observer to that original lighthouse is at a right angle with a new long line that we drew

130
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,300
Good news, right?

131
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,780
because that means we can apply the inverse Pythagorean theorem and that means that the apparent brightness from the original lighthouse is the same as

132
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,880
the combined brightness from the two newer ones and

133
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,100
of course

134
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,340
you can do that same thing over on the other side drawing a line through the top of the smaller circle and getting two new lighthouses

135
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,340
on the larger circle and

136
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,560
Even nicer these four lighthouses are all going to be evenly spaced around the lake

137
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,120
Why? Well the lines from those lighthouses to the center are at 90 degree angles with each other

138
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:33,200
So since things are symmetric left to right that means that the distances along the circumference are 1 2 2 2 and 1

139
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,280
Alright, you might see where this is going, but I want to walk through this for just one more step

140
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,420
You draw a circle twice as big so circumference of 16 now and for each lighthouse

141
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,780
You draw a line from that lighthouse through the top of the smaller circle

142
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:56,820
Which is the center of the bigger circle and then create two new lighthouses where that line intersects with the larger circle

143
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,340
Just as before because the long line is a diameter of the big circle

144
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,860
those two new lighthouses make a right angle with the observer right and

145
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,340
Just as before the line from the observer to the original lighthouse is

146
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:19,260
Perpendicular to the long line and those are the two facts that justify us in using the inverse Pythagorean theorem

147
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,680
But what might not be as clear is that when you do this for all of the lighthouses to get eight new ones on

148
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,460
The big lake those eight new lighthouses are going to be evenly spaced

149
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,640
This is the final bit of geometry proofiness before the final thrust

150
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,380
To see this remember that if you draw lines from two adjacent lighthouses on the small lake to the center

151
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,460
They make a 90 degree angle

152
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,820
If instead you draw lines to a point anywhere on the circumference of the circle that's not between them the very useful

153
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,620
inscribed angle theorem from geometry tells us that this will be

154
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,740
Exactly half of the angle that they make with the center in this case 45 degrees

155
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,500
But when we position that new point at the top of the lake

156
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,700
These are the two lines which define the position of the new lighthouses on the larger lake

157
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,480
What that means then is that when you draw lines from those eight new lighthouses into the center

158
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,400
They divide the circle evenly into 45 degree angle pieces

159
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:27,780
and that means the eight lighthouses are evenly spaced around the circumference with the distance of two between each one of them and

160
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,920
Now just imagine this thing playing on at every step doubling the size of each circle and

161
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,560
Transforming each lighthouse into two new ones along a line drawn through the center of the larger circle

162
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,840
at every step the apparent brightness to the observer remains the same pi squared over 4 and

163
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,600
at every step the lighthouses remain evenly spaced with the distance 2 between each one of them on the circumference and

164
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,440
In the limit what we're getting here is a flat horizontal line with an infinite number of lighthouses

165
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
evenly spaced in both directions and

166
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:10,220
Because the apparent brightness was pi squared over 4 the entire way that will also be true in this limiting case

167
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,060
And

168
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,520
This gives us a pretty awesome infinite series the sum of the inverse squares 1 over n squared

169
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,300
Where n covers all of the odd integers 1 3 5 and so on but also negative 1 negative 3 negative 5 off in the leftward direction

170
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,180
Adding all of those up is going to give us pi squared over 4

171
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,660
That's amazing and it's the core of what I want to show you and

172
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,300
Just take a step back and think about how unreal this seems

173
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,140
The sum of simple fractions that at first sight have nothing to do with geometry nothing to do with circles at all apparently

174
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,740
Gives us this result that's related to pi

175
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,500
Except now you can actually see what it has to do with geometry

176
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,380
the number line is kind of like a limit of ever-growing circles and

177
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,280
As you sum across that number line making sure to sum all the way to infinity on either side

178
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,100
It's sort of like you're adding up along the boundary of an infinitely large circle and a very loose

179
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
But very fun way of speaking

180
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,260
But wait you might say this is not the sum that you promised us at the start of the video

181
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,180
And well you're right. We do have a little bit of thinking left

182
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,940
First things first let's just restrict the sum to only being the positive odd numbers which gets us pi squared divided by 8

183
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,460
Now the only difference between this and the sum that we're looking for that goes over all the positive integers odd and even is

184
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,940
That it's missing the sum of the reciprocals of even numbers what I'm coloring in red up here

185
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,240
Now you can think of that missing series as a scaled copy of the total series that we want

186
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,320
Where each lighthouse moves to being twice as far away from the origin one gets shifted to two two gets shifted to four

187
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,080
three gets shifted to six and so on and

188
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,760
because that involves doubling the distance for every lighthouse it means that the apparent brightness would be decreased by a factor of four and

189
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,120
That's also relatively straightforward algebra going from the sum over all the integers to the sum over the even integers

190
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,500
Involves multiplying by 1 4th and what that means is that going from all the integers to the odd ones

191
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,820
Would be multiplying by 3 4ths since the evens plus the odds have to give us the whole thing

192
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,000
So if we just flip that around that means going from the sum over the odd numbers to the sum over all positive integers

193
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,480
requires multiplying by 4 thirds

194
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,740
So taking that pi squared over 8 multiplying by 4 thirds badda boom badda bing

195
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,240
We've got ourselves a solution to the basil problem

196
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:48,620
