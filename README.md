This repository used to be used to keep track of translations for 3blue1brown videos, but since then I’ve switched to using what will hopefully be a more user-friendly solution, built with my friend Ben Eater: [criblate.com](https://criblate.com/)

Criblate creates a first-pass transcription and translation for a video using automatic tools but is centered on letting community members review and correct those translations.
Currently, translations that are reviewed by the community and accepted by the creator get uploaded as subtitles, but we’re working on ways to use these translations for dubs as well. In doing so, we want to be thoughtful about the shortcomings of AI.
