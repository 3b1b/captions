1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
For this video, I'm doing something a little different.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,280
I got the chance to sit down with Steven Strogatz and record a conversation.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,480
For those of you who don't know, Steve is a mathematician at Cornell.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,560
He's the author of several popular math books, and a frequent contributor to, among other

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
things, Radiolab and the New York Times.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,040
To put it shortly, he's one of the great mass communicators of math in our time.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,840
In our conversation, we talked about a lot of things, but it was all centering around

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,760
this one very famous problem in the history of math, the brachistochrone.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,280
And for the first two-thirds or so of the video, I'm just going to play some of that

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,560
conversation.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,640
We lay out the problem, talk about some of its history, and go through this solution

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,520
by Johann Bernoulli from the 17th century.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,680
After that, I'm going to show this proof that Steve showed me.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,300
It's by a modern mathematician, Mark Levy, and it gives a certain geometric insight to

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,820
Johann Bernoulli's original solution.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,060
And at the very end, I have a little challenge for you.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,540
We should probably start off by just defining the problem itself.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
Okay.

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
All right.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,540
You want me to take a crack at that?

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
Yeah, go for it.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,540
Okay.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,980
Yeah, so it's this complicated word, first of all, brachistochrone, that comes from two...

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,460
Gee, I have to check.

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,900
Are those Latin or Greek words?

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,900
I think...

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,380
I'm pretty sure they're Greek.

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,380
Okay.

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,220
Greek words for the shortest time, and it refers to a question that was posed by one

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,260
of their Bernoulli brothers, by Johann Bernoulli.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,420
If you imagine a chute and there's a particle moving down a chute, being pulled by gravity,

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,420
what's the path of the chute that connects two points so that it goes from point A to

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,300
point B in the shortest amount of time?

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,320
I think what I like most about this problem is that it's relatively easy to describe qualitatively

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,980
what you're going for.

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,360
You want the path to be short, something like a straight line, but you want the object

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,600
to get going fast, which requires starting steeply, and that adds length to your line.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,460
But making this quantitative and actually finding the balance with a specific curve,

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,780
it's not at all obvious and makes for a really interesting problem.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,780
It is.

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
It's a really interesting thing.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,380
I mean, most people, when they first hear it, assume that the shortest path will give

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,760
the shortest time, that the straight line is the best.

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
But as you say, it can help to build up some steam by rolling straight down at first, or

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
not necessarily rolling.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,500
I mean, you could picture it sliding.

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,820
That doesn't really matter how we phrase it.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,720
So Galileo had thought about this himself much earlier than Johann Bernoulli in 1638,

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,880
and Galileo thought that an arc of a circle would be the best thing.

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,700
So he had the idea that a bit of curvature might help.

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,760
And it turns out that the arc of the circle is not the right answer.

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,740
It's good, but there are better solutions.

53
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,320
And the history of real solutions starts with Johann Bernoulli posing this as a challenge.

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,780
So that's then in June of 1696.

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,980
And he posed it as a challenge really to the mathematical world at that time.

56
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,880
For him, that meant the mathematicians of Europe.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,400
And in particular, he was very concerned to show off that he was smarter than his brother.

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,600
So he had a brother, Jacob, and the two of them were quite bitter rivals, actually, both

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,160
tremendous mathematicians.

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,200
But Johann Bernoulli fancied himself the greatest mathematician of his era, not just better

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
than his brother.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,160
But I think he thought that he might be better than Leibniz, who was alive at the time, and

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,960
Isaac Newton, who was by then sort of an old man, I mean, more or less retired from doing

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
math.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,800
He was the warden of the mint, be something like secretary of the treasury nowadays.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,120
And Newton shows him up, right?

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,340
He stays up all night and solves it, even though it took Johann Bernoulli two weeks

68
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
to solve it.

69
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,720
Right, that's the great story, that Newton was shown the problem, wasn't really pleased

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,040
to be challenged, especially by somebody that he considered beneath him.

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,960
I mean, he considered pretty much everybody beneath him.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,840
But yeah, Newton stayed up all night, solved it.

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,140
And then sent it in anonymously to the Philosophical Transactions, the journal at the time.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,120
And it was published anonymously.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,600
So Newton complained in a letter to a friend of his.

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,520
He said, I do not love to be donned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things.

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,280
So he didn't enjoy this challenge, but he did solve it.

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,680
The famous legend is that Johann Bernoulli, on seeing this anonymous solution, said, I

79
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,360
recognize the lion by his claw.

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,680
I don't know if that's true, but it's a great story.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,720
Everyone loves to tell that story.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,400
And I suspect part of the reason that Johann was so eager to challenge other mathematicians

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,080
like Newton is he secretly knew that his own solution was unusually clever.

84
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,480
Maybe we should start going into what he does.

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,440
Yes, he imagines that to solve the problem, you let light take care of it for you.

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,280
Because Fermat in the early 1600s had shown that you could state the way that light travels,

87
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,920
whether bouncing off of a mirror or refracting from air into water where it bends or going

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
through a lens.

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,960
All the motion of light could be understood by saying that light takes whatever path gets

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,080
it from point A to point B in the shortest time.

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Which is a really awesome perspective when you think about it, because usually you think

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,840
very locally in terms of what happens to a particle at each specific point.

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,080
This steps back and looks at all possible paths and says nature chooses the best one.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Yes, it is.

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,120
It's a beautiful and as you say, really an awe-inspiring mental shift.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
For some people, literally awe-inspiring in the sense that it had religious overtones,

97
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,960
that somehow nature is imbued with this property of doing the most efficient thing.

98
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh, interesting.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Leaving that aside, you could just say it's an empirical fact that that is how light behaves.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,640
So Johann Bernoulli's idea was to then use Fermat's principle of least time and say,

101
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,400
let's pretend that instead of a particle sliding down a chute, it's light traveling through

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,800
media of different index of refraction, meaning that the light would go at different speeds

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,120
as it successively went sort of down the chute.

104
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,480
And I think before we dive into that case, we should look at something simpler.

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,440
At this point in the conversation, we talked for a while about Snell's law.

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,600
This is a result in physics that describes how light bends when it goes from one material

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,680
into another where its speed changes.

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,280
I made a separate video out of this talking about how you can prove it using Fermat's

109
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,720
principle together with a very neat argument using imaginary constant tension springs.

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,760
But for now, all you need to know is the statement of Snell's law itself.

111
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,480
When a beam of light passes from one medium into another, and you consider the angle that

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,920
it makes with a line perpendicular to the boundary between those two materials, the

113
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,000
sine of that angle divided by the speed of light stays constant as you move from one

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,120
medium to the next.

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,720
So what Johann Bernoulli does is find a neat way to take advantage of that fact, this sine

116
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,520
of theta over v stays constant fact, for the brachistochrone problem.

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,920
When he thinks about what's happening with the particle sliding down the chute, he notices

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,360
that by conservation of energy, the velocity that the particle has will be proportional

119
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,680
to the square root of the distance from the top.

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,720
And just to spell that out a little bit more, the loss in potential energy is its mass times

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,600
the gravitational constant times y, that distance from the top.

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,160
And when you set that equal to the kinetic energy, one half times mv squared, and you

123
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,640
rearrange, the velocity v will indeed end up being proportional to the square root of

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
y.

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,680
Yes.

126
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,800
So that then gives him the idea about, let's imagine glass of many different layers, each

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,240
with a different velocity characteristic for the light in it.

128
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,400
The velocity in the first one is v1, and the next one is v2, and the next one is v3, and

129
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,840
these are all going to be proportional to the square root of y1 or y2 or y3.

130
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,520
And in principle, you should be thinking about a limiting process where you have infinitely

131
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,440
many infinitely thin layers, and this is kind of a continuous change for the speed of light.

132
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,280
And so then his question is, if light is always instantaneously obeying Snell's law as it

133
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,920
goes from one medium to the next, so that v over sine theta is always a constant as

134
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,400
I move from one layer to the next, what is that path where, you know, such that these

135
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,600
tangent lines are always instantaneously obeying Snell's law?

136
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,080
And for the record, we should probably just state exactly what that property is.

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,800
So the conclusion that Johan made was that if you look at whatever the time-minimizing

138
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,400
curve is, and you take any point on that curve, the sine of the angle between the tangent

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,340
line at that point and the vertical divided by the square root of the vertical distance

140
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,400
between that point and the start of the curve, that's going to be some constant independent

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,260
of the point that you chose.

142
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,180
And when Johan Bernoulli first saw this, correct me if I'm wrong, he just recognized it as

143
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,940
the differential equation for a cycloid, the shape traced by the point on the rim of a

144
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,640
rolling wheel.

145
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,280
But it's not obvious, certainly not obvious to me, why this sine of theta over square

146
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,620
root y property has anything to do with rolling wheels.

147
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,440
It's not at all obvious, but this is again the genius of Mark Levy to the rescue.

148
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
You want to say a few words about Mark Levy?

149
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,900
Yeah, well, Mark Levy is a very clever, as well as a very nice guy who is a friend of

150
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,640
mine and a terrific mathematician at Penn State who has written a book called The Mathematical

151
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,580
Mechanic in which he uses principles of mechanics and more generally physics to solve all kinds

152
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,400
of math problems.

153
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,980
That is, rather than math in the service of science, it's science in the service of math.

154
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,120
And as an example of the kinds of clever things that he does, he recently published a little

155
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,320
note, very short, showing that if you look at the geometry of a cycloid, just drawing

156
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,840
the correct lines in the right places, that this principle of velocity over sine theta

157
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:39,120
being constant is built in to the motion of the cycloid itself.

158
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,640
So in that conversation, we never actually talked about the details of the proof itself.

159
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,400
It's kind of a hard thing to do without visuals.

160
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,020
But I think a lot of you out there enjoy seeing the math and not just talking about the math.

161
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,300
It's also a really elegant little piece of geometry, so I'm going to go through it here.

162
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,600
Imagine a wheel rolling on the ceiling, and picture a point P on the rim of that wheel.

163
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,220
Mark Levy's first insight was that the point where the wheel touches the ceiling, that

164
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,780
I'll call C, acts as this instantaneous center of rotation for the trajectory of P.

165
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,620
It's as if, for that moment, P is on the end of a pendulum whose base is at C.

166
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,720
Since the tangent line of any circle is always perpendicular to the radius, the tangent line

167
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,100
of the cycloid path of P is perpendicular to the line Pc.

168
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,780
This gives us a right angle inside of the circle, and any right triangle inscribed in

169
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,840
a circle must have the diameter as its hypotenuse.

170
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,820
So from that, you can conclude that the tangent line always intersects the bottom of the circle.

171
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,740
Now, let theta be the angle between this tangent line and the vertical.

172
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,780
We get a pair of similar triangles, which I'll just show on the screen.

173
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,140
You can see that the length of Pc is the diameter times sine of theta.

174
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,420
Using the second similar triangle, this length times sine of theta again gives the distance

175
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,940
between P and the ceiling.

176
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,620
This is the distance we were calling y earlier.

177
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,580
Rearranging this, we see that sine of theta divided by the square root of y is equal to

178
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,220
1 divided by the square root of the diameter.

179
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,100
Since the diameter of a circle stays constant throughout the rotation, this implies that

180
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,140
the sine of theta divided by square root of y is constant on a cycloid, and that's exactly

181
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,440
the Snell's law property we're looking for.

182
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Note that when you combine Yohann Bernoulli's insight with this geometry proof, that's

183
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,880
the cleverest solution of the brachistochrome I've ever seen.

184
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,840
And I could call it done here, but given that the whole history of this problem started

185
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,300
with a challenge Yohann Bernoulli posed, I want to finish things off with a little challenge

186
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,200
of my own.

187
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,920
When I was playing around with the equations of a cycloid, something interesting popped

188
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
out.

189
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,520
Consider an object sliding down the cycloid due to gravity, and think about where it is

190
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,440
along the curve as a function of time.

191
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,560
Now think about how the curve is defined, as this trajectory of the point on a rim of

192
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,800
a rotating wheel.

193
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,160
How might you tweak the rate at which the wheel rotates so that when the object starts

194
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:38,080
sliding, the marked point on the rim of the wheel always stays fixed to that sliding object?

195
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,560
Do you start rotating it slowly and increase its speed?

196
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,480
If so, according to what function?

197
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,960
It turns out, the wheel rotates at a constant rate, which is surprising.

198
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,800
This means gravity pulls you along a cycloid in precisely the same way that a constantly

199
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,560
rotating wheel would.

200
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,520
The warm-up part of this challenge is just confirm this for yourself, it's kind of

201
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,440
fun to see how it falls out of the equations.

202
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,080
But this got me thinking.

203
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,520
If we look back at our original brachistochrone problem, asking about the path of fastest

204
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,000
descent between two given points, maybe there's a slick way to reframe our thinking.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,040
How would it look if instead of describing the trajectory of a sliding object in terms

206
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,040
of its x and y coordinates, we described it in terms of the angle that the velocity vector

207
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
makes as a function of time?

208
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,340
I mean, you can imagine defining a curve by having an object start sliding, then turning

209
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,980
a knob to determine the angle at which it's sliding at each point in time, always being

210
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,060
pulled by gravity.

211
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,360
If you describe the angle of the knob as a function of time, you are in fact uniquely

212
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,020
describing a curve.

213
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,460
You're basically using a differential equation, since what's given is the slope as a function

214
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,220
of some other parameter, in this case time.

215
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,940
So what's interesting here is that when you look at the solution of the brachistochrone

216
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,900
problem not in the xy plane, but in the t-theta plane, where t is time, theta is the angle

217
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,260
of the path, all of the brachistochrone solutions are straight lines, that is to say theta increases

218
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,780
at a constant rate with respect to t.

219
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,300
When the solution of a curve minimization problem is a straight line, it's highly suggestive

220
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,820
that there's some way to view it as a shortest path problem.

221
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,060
Here it's not so straightforward, since the boundary conditions that your object start

222
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,180
at point A and end at point B in the xy space doesn't just look like going from one point

223
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,460
to another in the theta-t space.

224
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,020
Nevertheless, my challenge to you is this.

225
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,500
Can you find another solution to the brachistochrone problem by explaining why it must be the case

226
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:48,340
that a time-minimizing trajectory, when represented in t-theta space, looks like a straight line?
