1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,520
For this video, I'm doing something a little different.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,560
I got the chance to sit down with Steven Strogatz and record a conversation.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,960
For those of you who don't know, Steve is a mathematician at Cornell.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,160
He's the author of several popular math books, and a frequent contributor to, 

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,600
among other things, Radiolab and the New York Times.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,960
To put it shortly, he's one of the great mass communicators of math in our time.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,465
In our conversation, we talked about a lot of things, 

8
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:34,913
but it was all centering around this one very famous problem in the history of math, 

9
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:35,960
the brachistochrone.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,730
And for the first two thirds or so of the video, 

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm just going to play some of that conversation.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,217
We lay out the problem, talk about some of its history, 

13
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:47,740
and go through this solution by Johann Bernoulli from the 17th century.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,400
After that, I'm going to show this proof that Steve showed me.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,477
It's by a modern mathematician, Mark Levy, and it gives a 

16
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:57,980
certain geometric insight to Johann Bernoulli's original solution.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,320
And at the very end, I have a little challenge for you.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,440
We should probably start off by just defining the problem itself.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:08,960
Okay.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,700
All right.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
You want me to take a crack at that?

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,260
Yeah, go for it.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,600
Okay.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,160
Yeah.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,960
So it's this complicated word, first of all, brachistochrone, that comes from two...

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,380
Gee, I have to check.

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,820
Are those Latin or Greek words?

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,540
I think...

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,720
I'm pretty sure they're Greek.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,460
Okay.

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,880
So Greek words for the shortest time.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,403
And it refers to a question that was posed by one of their Bernoulli brothers, 

33
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:33,680
by Johann Bernoulli.

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,400
If you imagine like a chute and there's a particle moving down a chute 

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
being pulled by gravity, what's the path of the chute that connects two 

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,400
points so that it goes from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time?

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,925
I think what I like most about this problem is that it's 

38
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:54,300
relatively easy to describe qualitatively what you're going for.

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,915
You want the path to be short, something like a straight line, 

40
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:02,133
but you want the object to get going fast, which requires starting steeply, 

41
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,020
and that adds length to your line.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,988
But making this quantitative and actually finding the balance with a specific curve, 

43
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:12,480
it's not at all obvious and makes for a really interesting problem.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,000
It is.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,420
It's a really interesting thing.

46
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,689
Most people when they first hear it assume that the shortest path 

47
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,860
will give the shortest time, that the straight line is the best.

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,353
But as you say, it can help to build up some steam by rolling straight down at first, 

49
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:27,840
or not necessarily rolling.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
You could picture it sliding.

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,220
That doesn't really matter how we phrase it.

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,160
So Galileo had thought about this himself much earlier than Johann Bernoulli in 1638.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,800
And Galileo thought that an arc of a circle would be the best thing.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
So he had the idea that a bit of curvature might help.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,300
And it turns out that the arc of the circle is not the right answer.

56
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,860
It's good, but there are better solutions.

57
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,260
And the history of real solutions starts with Johann Bernoulli posing this as a challenge.

58
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,040
So that's then in June of 1696.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,760
And he posed it as a challenge really to the mathematical world at that time.

60
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,020
For him, that meant the mathematicians of Europe.

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,820
And in particular, he was very concerned to show off that he was smarter than his brother.

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,492
So he had a brother, Jacob, and the two of them were quite bitter rivals, 

63
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,960
actually, both tremendous mathematicians.

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,897
But Johann Bernoulli fancied himself the greatest mathematician of his era, 

65
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,920
not just better than his brother.

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,133
But I think he thought that he might be better than Leibniz, 

67
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:37,660
who was alive at the time, and Isaac Newton, who was by then sort of an old man.

68
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,040
I mean, more or less retired from doing math.

69
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,060
Newton was the warden of the mint, be something like secretary of the treasury nowadays.

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
And Newton shows him up, right?

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,754
He stays up all night and solves it, even though 

72
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:52,320
it took Johann Bernoulli two weeks to solve it.

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,820
That's right.

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,107
That's the great story that Newton was shown the problem, 

75
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:02,283
wasn't really pleased to be challenged, especially by somebody that he 

76
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,960
considered beneath him.

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
I mean, he considered pretty much everybody beneath him.

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,829
But yeah, Newton stayed up all night, solved it, 

79
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,519
and then sent it in anonymously to the Philosophical Transactions, 

80
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,200
the journal at the time.

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,640
And it was published anonymously.

82
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,560
And so Newton complained in a letter to a friend of his.

83
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,780
He said, I do not love to be done and teased by foreigners about mathematical things.

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,800
So he didn't enjoy this challenge, but he did solve it.

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,022
The famous legend is that Johann Bernoulli, on seeing this anonymous solution, 

86
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,600
said, I recognize the lion by his claw.

87
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,360
I don't know if that's true, but it's a great story.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
Everyone loves to tell that story.

89
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,935
And I suspect part of the reason that Johann was so eager to challenge other 

90
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:52,980
mathematicians like Newton is he secretly knew that his own solution was unusually clever.

91
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,680
Maybe we should start going into what he does.

92
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,650
Yes, he imagines that to solve the problem, you let light take care of it for you, 

93
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,497
because Fermat in the early 1600s had shown that you could state the 

94
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:12,485
way that light travels, whether bouncing off of a mirror or refracting 

95
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:16,700
from air into water, where it bends or going through a lens.

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,859
All the motion of light could be understood by saying that light takes 

97
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:24,540
whatever path gets it from point A to point B in the shortest time.

98
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,874
Which is a really awesome perspective when you think about it, 

99
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:32,161
because usually you think very locally in terms of what happens to a particle at 

100
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,220
each specific point.

101
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,940
This steps back and looks at all possible paths and says nature chooses the best one.

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,680
Yes, it is.

103
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,240
It's a beautiful and as you say, really an awe-inspiring mental shift.

104
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,026
For some people, literally awe-inspiring in the sense that it had religious overtones, 

105
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:54,860
that somehow nature is imbued with this property of doing the most efficient thing.

106
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,540
Oh, interesting.

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,473
But leaving that aside, you could just say it's 

108
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:01,080
an empirical fact that that is how light behaves.

109
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,951
And so Johann Bernoulli's idea was to then use Fermat's principle of least time 

110
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,754
and say let's pretend that instead of a particle sliding down a chute, 

111
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:16,422
it's light traveling through media of different index of refraction, 

112
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:21,902
meaning that the light would go at different speeds as it successively went sort 

113
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:23,120
of down the chute.

114
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,340
And I think before we dive into that case, we should look at something simpler.

115
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,820
So at this point in the conversation, we talked for a while about Snell's law.

116
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,456
This is a result in physics that describes how light bends when 

117
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:37,740
it goes from one material into another where its speed changes.

118
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,736
I made a separate video out of this talking about how you can prove it using Fermat's 

119
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,757
law's principle together with a very neat argument using imaginary constant tension 

120
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:47,140
springs.

121
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,980
But for now, all you need to know is the statement of Snell's law itself.

122
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,008
When a beam of light passes from one medium into another, 

123
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:59,218
and you consider the angle that it makes with a line perpendicular to 

124
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:03,127
the boundary between those two materials, the sine of that angle 

125
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:08,240
divided by the speed of light stays constant as you move from one medium to the next.

126
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,385
So what Johann Bernoulli does is find a neat way to take advantage of that fact, 

127
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:17,760
this sine of theta over v stays constant fact, for the brachistochrone problem.

128
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,154
When he thinks about what's happening with the particle sliding down the chute, 

129
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:27,496
he notices that by conservation of energy, the velocity that the particle 

130
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:31,780
has will be proportional to the square root of the distance from the top.

131
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,289
And just to spell that out a little bit more, the loss in potential energy is 

132
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,800
its mass times the gravitational constant times y, that distance from the top.

133
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,074
And when you set that equal to the kinetic energy, one half times mv squared, 

134
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:53,382
and you rearrange, the velocity v will indeed end up being proportional to the square 

135
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:54,000
root of y.

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,360
Mm-hmm, yes.

137
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,253
So that then gives him the idea about, let's imagine glass of many different layers, 

138
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:07,000
each with a different velocity characteristic for the light in it.

139
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,801
The velocity in the first one is v1, and the next one is v2, and the next one is v3, 

140
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:17,980
and these are all going to be proportional to the square root of y1 or y2 or y3.

141
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,570
And in principle, you should be thinking about a limiting 

142
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,905
process where you have infinitely many infinitely thin layers, 

143
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,240
and this is kind of a continuous change for the speed of light.

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,221
And so then his question is, if light is always instantaneously obeying Snell's 

145
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:41,003
law as it goes from one medium to the next, so that v over sine theta is always 

146
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:47,074
a constant as I move from one layer to the next, what is that path where, you know, 

147
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:52,640
such that these tangent lines are always instantaneously obeying Snell's law?

148
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,860
And for the record, we should probably just state exactly what that property is.

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,280
Okay.

150
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,046
So the conclusion that Johan made was that if you look at whatever the 

151
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:06,603
time-minimizing curve is, and you take any point on that curve, 

152
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:10,939
the sine of the angle between the tangent line at that point and the vertical 

153
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:15,108
divided by the square root of the vertical distance between that point and 

154
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:19,332
the start of the curve, that's going to be some constant independent of the 

155
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:20,500
point that you chose.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,340
Mm-hmm.

157
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,258
And when Johan Bernoulli first saw this, correct me if I'm wrong, 

158
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:29,177
he just recognized it as the differential equation for a cycloid, 

159
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:32,740
the shape traced by the point on the rim of a rolling wheel.

160
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,896
But it's not obvious, certainly not obvious to me, 

161
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:42,960
why this sine of theta over square root y property has anything to do with rolling wheels.

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,800
It's not at all obvious, but this is again the genius of Mark Levy to the rescue.

163
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
You want to say a few words about Mark Levy?

164
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,345
Yeah, well, Mark Levy is a very clever, as well as a very nice guy who is 

165
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,993
a friend of mine and a terrific mathematician at Penn State who has written 

166
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:05,335
a book called The Mathematical Mechanic in which he uses principles of 

167
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:09,800
mechanics and more generally physics to solve all kinds of math problems.

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,200
That is, rather than math in the service of science, it's science in the service of math.

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,775
And as an example of the kinds of clever things that he does, 

170
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,391
he recently published a little note, very short, 

171
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:26,450
showing that if you look at the geometry of a cycloid, 

172
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,288
just drawing the correct lines in the right places, 

173
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:36,339
that this principle of velocity over sine theta being constant is built in to the 

174
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,480
motion of the cycloid itself.

175
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,040
So, in that conversation, we never actually talked about the details of the proof itself.

176
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,680
It's kind of a hard thing to do without visuals.

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,405
But I think a lot of you out there enjoy seeing 

178
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,360
the math and not just talking about the math.

179
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,320
It's also a really elegant little piece of geometry, so I'm going to go through it here.

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,460
Imagine a wheel rolling on the ceiling, and picture a point P on the rim of that wheel.

181
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,366
Mark Levy's first insight was that the point where the wheel touches the ceiling, 

182
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:17,040
that I'll call C, acts as this instantaneous center of rotation for the trajectory of P.

183
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,180
It's as if, for that moment, P is on the end of a pendulum whose base is at C.

184
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,183
Since the tangent line of any circle is always perpendicular to the radius, 

185
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:33,860
the tangent line of the cycloid path of P is perpendicular to the line Pc.

186
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,653
This gives us a right angle inside of the circle, 

187
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:42,940
and any right triangle inscribed in a circle must have the diameter as its hypotenuse.

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,390
So from that, you can conclude that the tangent 

189
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,940
line always intersects the bottom of the circle.

190
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,740
Now, let theta be the angle between this tangent line and the vertical.

191
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,320
We get a pair of similar triangles, which I'll just show on the screen.

192
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,240
You can see that the length of Pc is the diameter times sine of theta.

193
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,280
Using the second similar triangle, this length times sine of theta again gives 

194
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,500
the distance between P and the ceiling, the distance we were calling y earlier.

195
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,738
Rearranging this, we see that sine of theta divided by the square 

196
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:29,980
root of y is equal to 1 divided by the square root of the diameter.

197
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,649
Since the diameter of a circle stays constant throughout the rotation, 

198
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,659
this implies that the sine of theta divided by the square root of y is 

199
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:43,460
constant on a cycloid, and that's exactly the Snell's law property we're looking for.

200
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,382
So when you combine Johan Bernoulli's insight with this geometry proof, 

201
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:52,200
that's the cleverest solution of the brachistochrome I've ever seen.

202
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,939
And I could call it done here, but given that the whole history 

203
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:00,647
of this problem started with a challenge that Johan Bernoulli posed, 

204
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,980
I want to finish things off with a little challenge of my own.

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,731
When I was playing around with the equations of a cycloid, 

206
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,260
something interesting popped out.

207
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,944
Consider an object sliding down the cycloid due to gravity, 

208
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:16,360
and think about where it is along the curve as a function of time.

209
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,876
Now think about how the curve is defined, as this 

210
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,460
trajectory of the point on a rim of a rotating wheel.

211
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,613
How might you tweak the rate at which the wheel rotates so that when the object starts 

212
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:33,590
sliding, the marked point on the rim of the wheel always stays fixed to that sliding 

213
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,000
object?

214
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,880
Do you start rotating it slowly and increase its speed?

215
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,060
If so, according to what function?

216
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,240
It turns out, the wheel will rotate at a constant rate, which is surprising.

217
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,783
This means that gravity pulls you along a cycloid in 

218
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:56,180
precisely the same way that a constantly rotating wheel would.

219
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,559
The warm-up part of this challenge is just confirm this for yourself, 

220
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,360
it's kind of fun to see how it falls out of the equations.

221
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,783
But this got me thinking, if we look back at our original brachistochrone problem, 

222
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:12,355
asking about the path of fastest descent between two given points, 

223
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:15,020
maybe there's a slick way to reframe our thinking.

224
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,473
How would it look if instead of describing the trajectory of a sliding 

225
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:23,023
object in terms of its x and y coordinates, we described it in terms 

226
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:26,420
of the angle that the velocity vector makes as a function of time?

227
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,374
I mean, you can imagine defining a curve by having an object start sliding, 

228
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:36,185
then turning a knob to determine the angle at which it's sliding at each point in time, 

229
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,880
always being pulled by gravity.

230
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,035
If you describe the angle of the knob as a function of time, 

231
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:44,340
you are in fact uniquely describing a curve.

232
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,338
You're basically using a differential equation, 

233
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:51,860
since what's given is the slope as a function of some other parameter, in this case time.

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,985
So what's interesting here is that when you look at the solution of the 

235
00:14:56,985 --> 00:15:01,191
brachistochrone problem not in the xy-plane, but in the t-theta plane, 

236
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,094
where t is time, theta is the angle of the path, 

237
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:07,471
all of the brachistochrone solutions are straight lines, 

238
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:11,500
that is to say theta increases at a constant rate with respect to t.

239
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,846
When the solution of a curve minimization problem is a straight line, 

240
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:19,720
it's highly suggestive that there's some way to view it as a shortest path problem.

241
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,097
Here, it's not so straightforward, since the boundary conditions that 

242
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:28,781
your objects start at a point a and end at a point b in the xy-space 

243
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:32,840
doesn't just look like going from one point to another in the theta-t space.

244
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:47,880
Nevertheless, my challenge to you is this.
