1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,520
For this video, I'm doing something a little different.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,560
I got the chance to sit down with Steven Strogatz and record a conversation.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,960
For those of you who don't know, Steve is a mathematician at Cornell.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,440
He's the author of several popular math books, and a frequent contributor to, among other

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,600
things, Radiolab and the New York Times.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,960
To put it shortly, he's one of the great mass communicators of math in our time.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,820
In our conversation, we talked about a lot of things, but it was all centering around

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,960
this one very famous problem in the history of math, the brachistochrone.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,260
And for the first two thirds or so of the video, I'm just going to play some of that

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,800
conversation.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,600
We lay out the problem, talk about some of its history, and go through this solution

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,740
by Johann Bernoulli from the 17th century.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,400
After that, I'm going to show this proof that Steve showed me.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,400
It's by a modern mathematician, Mark Levy, and it gives a certain geometric insight to

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,980
Johann Bernoulli's original solution.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,320
And at the very end, I have a little challenge for you.

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,440
We should probably start off by just defining the problem itself.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:08,960
Okay.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,700
All right.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
You want me to take a crack at that?

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,260
Yeah, go for it.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,600
Okay.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,160
Yeah.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,960
So it's this complicated word, first of all, brachistochrone, that comes from two...

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,380
Gee, I have to check.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,820
Are those Latin or Greek words?

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,540
I think...

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,720
I'm pretty sure they're Greek.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,460
Okay.

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,880
So Greek words for the shortest time.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,100
And it refers to a question that was posed by one of their Bernoulli brothers, by Johann

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,680
Bernoulli.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,140
If you imagine like a chute and there's a particle moving down a chute being pulled

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,180
by gravity, what's the path of the chute that connects two points so that it goes from point

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,400
A to point B in the shortest amount of time?

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,200
I think what I like most about this problem is that it's relatively easy to describe qualitatively

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,300
what you're going for.

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,540
You want the path to be short, something like a straight line, but you want the object to

39
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,020
get going fast, which requires starting steeply, and that adds length to your line.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
But making this quantitative and actually finding the balance with a specific curve,

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,480
it's not at all obvious and makes for a really interesting problem.

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,000
It is.

43
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,420
It's a really interesting thing.

44
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,940
Most people when they first hear it assume that the shortest path will give the shortest

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,860
time, that the straight line is the best.

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,640
But as you say, it can help to build up some steam by rolling straight down at first, or

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
not necessarily rolling.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
You could picture it sliding.

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,220
That doesn't really matter how we phrase it.

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,160
So Galileo had thought about this himself much earlier than Johann Bernoulli in 1638.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,800
And Galileo thought that an arc of a circle would be the best thing.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
So he had the idea that a bit of curvature might help.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,300
And it turns out that the arc of the circle is not the right answer.

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,860
It's good, but there are better solutions.

55
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,260
And the history of real solutions starts with Johann Bernoulli posing this as a challenge.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,040
So that's then in June of 1696.

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,760
And he posed it as a challenge really to the mathematical world at that time.

58
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,020
For him, that meant the mathematicians of Europe.

59
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,820
And in particular, he was very concerned to show off that he was smarter than his brother.

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,180
So he had a brother, Jacob, and the two of them were quite bitter rivals, actually, both

61
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,960
tremendous mathematicians.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,220
But Johann Bernoulli fancied himself the greatest mathematician of his era, not just better

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,920
than his brother.

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,780
But I think he thought that he might be better than Leibniz, who was alive at the time, and

65
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,660
Isaac Newton, who was by then sort of an old man.

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,040
I mean, more or less retired from doing math.

67
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,060
Newton was the warden of the mint, be something like secretary of the treasury nowadays.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
And Newton shows him up, right?

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,360
He stays up all night and solves it, even though it took Johann Bernoulli two weeks

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
to solve it.

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,820
That's right.

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,320
That's the great story that Newton was shown the problem, wasn't really pleased to be

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,960
challenged, especially by somebody that he considered beneath him.

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
I mean, he considered pretty much everybody beneath him.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,540
But yeah, Newton stayed up all night, solved it, and then sent it in anonymously to the

76
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,200
Philosophical Transactions, the journal at the time.

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,640
And it was published anonymously.

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,560
And so Newton complained in a letter to a friend of his.

79
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,780
He said, I do not love to be done and teased by foreigners about mathematical things.

80
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,800
So he didn't enjoy this challenge, but he did solve it.

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,600
The famous legend is that Johann Bernoulli, on seeing this anonymous solution, said, I

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
recognize the lion by his claw.

83
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,360
I don't know if that's true, but it's a great story.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
Everyone loves to tell that story.

85
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,420
And I suspect part of the reason that Johann was so eager to challenge other mathematicians

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,980
like Newton is he secretly knew that his own solution was unusually clever.

87
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,680
Maybe we should start going into what he does.

88
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,560
Yes, he imagines that to solve the problem, you let light take care of it for you, because

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:11,420
Fermat in the early 1600s had shown that you could state the way that light travels, whether

90
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,140
bouncing off of a mirror or refracting from air into water, where it bends or going through

91
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,700
a lens.

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,000
All the motion of light could be understood by saying that light takes whatever path gets

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,540
it from point A to point B in the shortest time.

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,180
Which is a really awesome perspective when you think about it, because usually you think

95
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,220
very locally in terms of what happens to a particle at each specific point.

96
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,940
This steps back and looks at all possible paths and says nature chooses the best one.

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,680
Yes, it is.

98
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,240
It's a beautiful and as you say, really an awe-inspiring mental shift.

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,500
For some people, literally awe-inspiring in the sense that it had religious overtones,

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,860
that somehow nature is imbued with this property of doing the most efficient thing.

101
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,540
Oh, interesting.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,620
But leaving that aside, you could just say it's an empirical fact that that is how light

103
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,080
behaves.

104
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,480
And so Johann Bernoulli's idea was to then use Fermat's principle of least time and say

105
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,400
let's pretend that instead of a particle sliding down a chute, it's light traveling through

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,040
media of different index of refraction, meaning that the light would go at different speeds

107
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,120
as it successively went sort of down the chute.

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,340
And I think before we dive into that case, we should look at something simpler.

109
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,820
So at this point in the conversation, we talked for a while about Snell's law.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,580
This is a result in physics that describes how light bends when it goes from one material

111
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,740
into another where its speed changes.

112
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,280
I made a separate video out of this talking about how you can prove it using Fermat's

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,640
law's principle together with a very neat argument using imaginary constant tension

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,140
springs.

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,980
But for now, all you need to know is the statement of Snell's law itself.

116
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,520
When a beam of light passes from one medium into another, and you consider the angle that

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,020
it makes with a line perpendicular to the boundary between those two materials, the

118
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,120
sine of that angle divided by the speed of light stays constant as you move from one

119
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
medium to the next.

120
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,840
So what Johann Bernoulli does is find a neat way to take advantage of that fact, this sine

121
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,760
of theta over v stays constant fact, for the brachistochrone problem.

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,900
When he thinks about what's happening with the particle sliding down the chute, he notices

123
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,300
that by conservation of energy, the velocity that the particle has will be proportional

124
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,780
to the square root of the distance from the top.

125
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:38,700
And just to spell that out a little bit more, the loss in potential energy is its mass times

126
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,800
the gravitational constant times y, that distance from the top.

127
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,080
And when you set that equal to the kinetic energy, one half times mv squared, and you

128
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,740
rearrange, the velocity v will indeed end up being proportional to the square root of

129
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,000
y.

130
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,360
Mm-hmm, yes.

131
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:03,860
So that then gives him the idea about, let's imagine glass of many different layers, each

132
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,000
with a different velocity characteristic for the light in it.

133
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,360
The velocity in the first one is v1, and the next one is v2, and the next one is v3, and

134
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,980
these are all going to be proportional to the square root of y1 or y2 or y3.

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
And in principle, you should be thinking about a limiting process where you have infinitely

136
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,240
many infinitely thin layers, and this is kind of a continuous change for the speed of light.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,320
And so then his question is, if light is always instantaneously obeying Snell's law as it

138
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,980
goes from one medium to the next, so that v over sine theta is always a constant as

139
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,540
I move from one layer to the next, what is that path where, you know, such that these

140
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,640
tangent lines are always instantaneously obeying Snell's law?

141
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,860
And for the record, we should probably just state exactly what that property is.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,280
Okay.

143
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,840
So the conclusion that Johan made was that if you look at whatever the time-minimizing

144
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,440
curve is, and you take any point on that curve, the sine of the angle between the tangent

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,340
line at that point and the vertical divided by the square root of the vertical distance

146
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,300
between that point and the start of the curve, that's going to be some constant independent

147
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,500
of the point that you chose.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,340
Mm-hmm.

149
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,280
And when Johan Bernoulli first saw this, correct me if I'm wrong, he just recognized it as

150
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,140
the differential equation for a cycloid, the shape traced by the point on the rim of a

151
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,740
rolling wheel.

152
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,280
But it's not obvious, certainly not obvious to me, why this sine of theta over square

153
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,960
root y property has anything to do with rolling wheels.

154
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,800
It's not at all obvious, but this is again the genius of Mark Levy to the rescue.

155
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
You want to say a few words about Mark Levy?

156
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,980
Yeah, well, Mark Levy is a very clever, as well as a very nice guy who is a friend of

157
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,580
mine and a terrific mathematician at Penn State who has written a book called The Mathematical

158
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,560
Mechanic in which he uses principles of mechanics and more generally physics to solve all kinds

159
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,800
of math problems.

160
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,200
That is, rather than math in the service of science, it's science in the service of math.

161
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,160
And as an example of the kinds of clever things that he does, he recently published a little

162
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,320
note, very short, showing that if you look at the geometry of a cycloid, just drawing

163
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,300
the correct lines in the right places, that this principle of velocity over sine theta

164
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,480
being constant is built in to the motion of the cycloid itself.

165
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,040
So, in that conversation, we never actually talked about the details of the proof itself.

166
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,680
It's kind of a hard thing to do without visuals.

167
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,360
But I think a lot of you out there enjoy seeing the math and not just talking about the math.

168
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,320
It's also a really elegant little piece of geometry, so I'm going to go through it here.

169
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,460
Imagine a wheel rolling on the ceiling, and picture a point P on the rim of that wheel.

170
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,120
Mark Levy's first insight was that the point where the wheel touches the ceiling, that

171
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,980
I'll call C, acts as this instantaneous center of rotation for the trajectory of P. It's

172
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:25,280
as if, for that moment, P is on the end of a pendulum whose base is at C. Since the tangent

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,520
line of any circle is always perpendicular to the radius, the tangent line of the cycloid

174
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,860
path of P is perpendicular to the line Pc.

175
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,820
This gives us a right angle inside of the circle, and any right triangle inscribed in

176
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,940
a circle must have the diameter as its hypotenuse.

177
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,940
So from that, you can conclude that the tangent line always intersects the bottom of the circle.

178
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,740
Now, let theta be the angle between this tangent line and the vertical.

179
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,320
We get a pair of similar triangles, which I'll just show on the screen.

180
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,240
You can see that the length of Pc is the diameter times sine of theta.

181
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,440
Using the second similar triangle, this length times sine of theta again gives the distance

182
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,500
between P and the ceiling, the distance we were calling y earlier.

183
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,740
Rearranging this, we see that sine of theta divided by the square root of y is equal to

184
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,980
1 divided by the square root of the diameter.

185
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,180
Since the diameter of a circle stays constant throughout the rotation, this implies that

186
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,700
the sine of theta divided by the square root of y is constant on a cycloid, and that's

187
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,460
exactly the Snell's law property we're looking for.

188
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,940
So when you combine Johan Bernoulli's insight with this geometry proof, that's the cleverest

189
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,200
solution of the brachistochrome I've ever seen.

190
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,820
And I could call it done here, but given that the whole history of this problem started

191
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,960
with a challenge that Johan Bernoulli posed, I want to finish things off with a little

192
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,980
challenge of my own.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,680
When I was playing around with the equations of a cycloid, something interesting popped

194
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,260
out.

195
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,560
Consider an object sliding down the cycloid due to gravity, and think about where it is

196
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,360
along the curve as a function of time.

197
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,620
Now think about how the curve is defined, as this trajectory of the point on a rim of

198
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,460
a rotating wheel.

199
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,160
How might you tweak the rate at which the wheel rotates so that when the object starts

200
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,000
sliding, the marked point on the rim of the wheel always stays fixed to that sliding object?

201
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,880
Do you start rotating it slowly and increase its speed?

202
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,060
If so, according to what function?

203
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,240
It turns out, the wheel will rotate at a constant rate, which is surprising.

204
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,780
This means that gravity pulls you along a cycloid in precisely the same way that a constantly

205
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,180
rotating wheel would.

206
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,700
The warm-up part of this challenge is just confirm this for yourself, it's kind of fun

207
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,360
to see how it falls out of the equations.

208
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,220
But this got me thinking, if we look back at our original brachistochrone problem, asking

209
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,900
about the path of fastest descent between two given points, maybe there's a slick way

210
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,020
to reframe our thinking.

211
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,040
How would it look if instead of describing the trajectory of a sliding object in terms

212
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,020
of its x and y coordinates, we described it in terms of the angle that the velocity vector

213
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,420
makes as a function of time?

214
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,340
I mean, you can imagine defining a curve by having an object start sliding, then turning

215
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,020
a knob to determine the angle at which it's sliding at each point in time, always being

216
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,880
pulled by gravity.

217
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,360
If you describe the angle of the knob as a function of time, you are in fact uniquely

218
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,340
describing a curve.

219
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,440
You're basically using a differential equation, since what's given is the slope as a function

220
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,860
of some other parameter, in this case time.

221
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,960
So what's interesting here is that when you look at the solution of the brachistochrone

222
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,900
problem not in the xy-plane, but in the t-theta plane, where t is time, theta is the angle

223
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,220
of the path, all of the brachistochrone solutions are straight lines, that is to say theta increases

224
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,500
at a constant rate with respect to t.

225
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,220
When the solution of a curve minimization problem is a straight line, it's highly suggestive

226
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,720
that there's some way to view it as a shortest path problem.

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,720
Here, it's not so straightforward, since the boundary conditions that your objects

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,500
start at a point a and end at a point b in the xy-space doesn't just look like going

229
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,840
from one point to another in the theta-t space.

230
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,860
Nevertheless, my challenge to you is this.

231
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,280
Can you find another solution to the brachistochrone problem by explaining why it must be the case

232
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:48,340
that a time-minimizing trajectory, when represented in t-theta space, looks like a straight line?
