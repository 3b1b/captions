00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Hey everyone, I've got another quick footnote for you between chapters today.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,360
When I've talked about linear transformations so far,

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,840
I've only really talked about transformations from 2D vectors to other 2D vectors,

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,720
represented with 2x2 matrices,

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,220
or from 3D vectors to other 3D vectors, represented with 3x3 matrices.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,140
But several commenters have asked about non-square matrices,

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,460
so I thought I'd take a moment to just show what those mean geometrically.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,260
By now in the series, you actually have most of the background you need

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,860
to start pondering a question like this on your own,

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,260
but I'll start talking through it just to give a little mental momentum.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,520
It's perfectly reasonable to talk about transformations between dimensions,

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,940
such as one that takes 2D vectors to 3D vectors.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,300
Again, what makes one of these linear is that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced,

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,180
and that the origin maps to the origin.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,580
What I have pictured here is the input space on the left,

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,180
which is just 2D space,

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,140
and the output of the transformation shown on the right.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,900
The reason I'm not showing the inputs move over to the outputs like I usually do

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,940
is not just animation laziness,

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,500
it's worth emphasizing that 2D vector inputs are very different animals

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,460
from these 3D vector outputs,

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,220
living in a completely separate unconnected space.

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,280
Encoding one of these transformations with a matrix

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,440
is really just the same thing as what we've done before.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,640
You look at where each basis vector lands,

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,840
and write the coordinates of the landing spots as the columns of a matrix.

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,560
For example, what you're looking at here is an output of a transformation

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,240
that takes i-hat to the coordinates 2, negative 1, negative 2,

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,800
and j-hat to the coordinates 0, 1, 1.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,460
Notice, this means the matrix encoding our transformation has three rows and two columns,

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,980
which to use standard terminology makes it a 3x2 matrix.

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,760
In the language of last video, the column space of this matrix,

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,460
the place where all the vectors land,

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,540
is a 2D plane slicing through the origin of 3D space.

35
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,700
But the matrix is still full rank,

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,300
since the number of dimensions in this column space

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,580
is the same as the number of dimensions of the input space.

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,300
So if you see a 3x2 matrix out in the wild,

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,820
you can know that it has the geometric interpretation

40
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,860
of mapping two dimensions to three dimensions,

41
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,060
since the two columns indicate that the input space has two basis vectors,

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,700
and the three rows indicate that the landing spots for each of those basis vectors

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,580
is described with three separate coordinates.

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,260
Likewise, if you see a 2x3 matrix with two rows and three columns,

45
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,580
what do you think that means?

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,660
Well, the three columns indicate that you're starting in a space

47
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,460
that has three basis vectors, so we're starting in three dimensions,

48
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,060
and the two rows indicate that the landing spot for each of those three basis vectors

49
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,620
is described with only two coordinates, so they must be landing in two dimensions.

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,500
So it's a transformation from 3D space onto the 2D plane,

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:14,080
a transformation that should feel very uncomfortable if you imagine going through it.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,020
You could also have a transformation from two dimensions to one dimension.

53
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,540
One-dimensional space is really just the number line,

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,940
so a transformation like this takes in 2D vectors and spits out numbers.

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,780
Thinking about grid lines remaining parallel and evenly spaced

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,500
is a little bit messy due to all of the squishification happening here,

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,180
so in this case, the visual understanding for what linearity means

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,200
is that if you have a line of evenly spaced dots,

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,900
it would remain evenly spaced once they're mapped onto the number line.

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,460
One of these transformations is encoded with a 1x2 matrix,

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,900
each of whose two columns has just a single entry.

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,740
The two columns represent where the basis vectors land,

63
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,520
and each one of those columns requires just one number,

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,420
the number that that basis vector landed on.

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,460
This is actually a surprisingly meaningful type of transformation

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,480
with close ties to the dot product, and I'll be talking about that next video.

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,900
Until then, I encourage you to play around with this idea on your own,

68
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,420
contemplating the meanings of things like matrix multiplication

69
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,180
and linear systems of equations in the context of transformations

70
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,180
between different dimensions.

71
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,180
Have fun!
