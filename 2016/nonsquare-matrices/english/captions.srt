00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,580
Hey everyone, I've got another quick footnote for you between chapters today.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,153
When I've talked about linear transformations so far, 

3
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:22,631
I've only really talked about transformations from 2D vectors to other 2D vectors, 

4
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:26,461
represented with 2x2 matrices, or from 3D vectors to other 3D vectors, 

5
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,080
represented with 3x3 matrices.

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,400
But several commenters have asked about non-square matrices, 

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,580
so I thought I'd take a moment to just show what those mean geometrically.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,874
By now in the series, you actually have most of the background 

9
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:40,329
you need to start pondering a question like this on your own, 

10
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,180
but I'll start talking through it just to give a little mental momentum.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,469
It's perfectly reasonable to talk about transformations between dimensions, 

12
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:51,280
such as one that takes 2D vectors to 3D vectors.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,399
Again, what makes one of these linear is that gridlines remain 

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,100
parallel and evenly spaced, and that the origin maps to the origin.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,676
What I have pictured here is the input space on the left, 

16
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:06,340
which is just 2D space, and the output of the transformation shown on the right.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,598
The reason I'm not showing the inputs move over to the outputs like I usually do is not 

18
00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:16,249
just animation laziness, it's worth emphasizing that 2D vector inputs are very different 

19
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:20,900
animals from these 3D vector outputs, living in a completely separate, unconnected space.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,365
Encoding one of these transformations with a matrix is 

21
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,780
really just the same thing as what we've done before.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,166
You look at where each basis vector lands, and write the 

23
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,100
coordinates of the landing spots as the columns of a matrix.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,328
For example, what you're looking at here is an output of a transformation that takes 

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,160
i-hat to the coordinates 2, negative 1, negative 2, and j-hat to the coordinates 0, 1, 1.

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,140
Notice, this means the matrix encoding our transformation has three rows and two columns, 

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,660
which, to use standard terminology, makes it a 3x2 matrix.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,604
In the language of last video, the column space of this matrix, 

29
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:06,201
the place where all the vectors land, is a 2D plane slicing through the origin 

30
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:06,900
of 3D space.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,475
But the matrix is still full rank, since the number of dimensions in this 

32
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:15,480
column space is the same as the number of dimensions of the input space.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,857
So if you see a 3x2 matrix out in the wild, you can know that it has the geometric 

34
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,381
interpretation of mapping two dimensions to three dimensions, 

35
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:29,644
since the two columns indicate that the input space has two basis vectors, 

36
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:34,532
and the three rows indicate that the landing spots for each of those basis vectors is 

37
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,920
described with three separate coordinates.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,459
Likewise, if you see a 2x3 matrix with two rows and three columns, 

39
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,000
what do you think that means?

40
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,590
Well, the three columns indicate that you're starting in a space that has 

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,777
three basis vectors, so we're starting in three dimensions, 

42
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:54,601
and the two rows indicate that the landing spot for each of those three 

43
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,469
basis vectors is described with only two coordinates, 

44
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,700
so they must be landing in two dimensions.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,113
So it's a transformation from 3D space onto the 2D plane, 

46
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:09,380
a transformation that should feel very uncomfortable if you imagine going through it.

47
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,080
You could also have a transformation from two dimensions to one dimension.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,788
One-dimensional space is really just the number line, 

49
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:24,880
so a transformation like this takes in 2D vectors and spits out numbers.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,870
Thinking about grid lines remaining parallel and evenly spaced is a little bit 

51
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,595
messy due to all of the squishification happening here, so in this case, 

52
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:37,677
the visual understanding for what linearity means is that if you have a line of 

53
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:41,707
evenly spaced dots, it would remain evenly spaced once they're mapped onto the 

54
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:42,320
number line.

55
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,060
One of these transformations is encoded with a 1x2 matrix, 

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,180
each of whose two columns has just a single entry.

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,537
The two columns represent where the basis vectors land, 

58
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,215
and each one of those columns requires just one number, 

59
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,320
the number that that basis vector landed on.

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,425
This is actually a surprisingly meaningful type of transformation with 

61
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:05,700
close ties to the dot product, and I'll be talking about that next video.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,079
Until then, I encourage you to play around with this idea on your own, 

63
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,966
contemplating the meanings of things like matrix multiplication and linear 

64
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:18,320
systems of equations in the context of transformations between different dimensions.
