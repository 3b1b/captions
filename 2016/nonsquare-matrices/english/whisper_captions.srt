00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,580
Hey everyone, I've got another quick footnote for you between chapters today.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,180
When I've talked about linear transformations so far,

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,200
I've only really talked about transformations from 2D vectors to other 2D vectors,

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,180
represented with 2x2 matrices,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
or from 3D vectors to other 3D vectors, represented with 3x3 matrices.

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,640
But several commenters have asked about non-square matrices,

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,580
so I thought I'd take a moment to just show what those mean geometrically.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,220
By now in the series, you actually have most of the background you need

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,420
to start pondering a question like this on your own,

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,180
but I'll start talking through it just to give a little mental momentum.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,860
It's perfectly reasonable to talk about transformations between dimensions,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,280
such as one that takes 2D vectors to 3D vectors.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,900
Again, what makes one of these linear is that gridlines remain parallel and evenly spaced,

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,100
and that the origin maps to the origin.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,680
What I have pictured here is the input space on the left, which is just 2D space,

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,340
and the output of the transformation shown on the right.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,640
The reason I'm not showing the inputs move over to the outputs like I usually do

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,460
is not just animation laziness,

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,060
it's worth emphasizing that 2D vector inputs are very different animals from these 3D vector outputs,

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,900
living in a completely separate, unconnected space.

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,840
Encoding one of these transformations with a matrix

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,780
is really just the same thing as what we've done before.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,180
You look at where each basis vector lands,

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,100
and write the coordinates of the landing spots as the columns of a matrix.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,220
For example, what you're looking at here is an output of a transformation

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,560
that takes i-hat to the coordinates 2, negative 1, negative 2,

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,160
and j-hat to the coordinates 0, 1, 1.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,960
Notice, this means the matrix encoding our transformation has three rows and two columns,

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,660
which, to use standard terminology, makes it a 3x2 matrix.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,480
In the language of last video, the column space of this matrix,

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,080
the place where all the vectors land,

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,900
is a 2D plane slicing through the origin of 3D space.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,180
But the matrix is still full rank,

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,960
since the number of dimensions in this column space

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,480
is the same as the number of dimensions of the input space.

36
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,820
So if you see a 3x2 matrix out in the wild,

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,440
you can know that it has the geometric interpretation

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
of mapping two dimensions to three dimensions,

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,480
since the two columns indicate that the input space has two basis vectors,

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,260
and the three rows indicate that the landing spots for each of those basis vectors

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,920
is described with three separate coordinates.

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,700
Likewise, if you see a 2x3 matrix with two rows and three columns,

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,000
what do you think that means?

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,120
Well, the three columns indicate that you're starting in a space that has three basis vectors,

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,700
so we're starting in three dimensions,

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,540
and the two rows indicate that the landing spot for each of those three basis vectors

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,060
is described with only two coordinates,

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,700
so they must be landing in two dimensions.

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,320
So it's a transformation from 3D space onto the 2D plane,

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,380
a transformation that should feel very uncomfortable if you imagine going through it.

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,080
You could also have a transformation from two dimensions to one dimension.

52
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,080
One-dimensional space is really just the number line,

53
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,880
so a transformation like this takes in 2D vectors and spits out numbers.

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
Thinking about grid lines remaining parallel and evenly spaced is a little bit messy

55
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,320
due to all of the squishification happening here,

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,820
so in this case, the visual understanding for what linearity means

57
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,740
is that if you have a line of evenly spaced dots,

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,320
it would remain evenly spaced once they're mapped onto the number line.

59
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,120
One of these transformations is encoded with a 1x2 matrix,

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,180
each of whose two columns has just a single entry.

61
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,300
The two columns represent where the basis vectors land,

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,100
and each one of those columns requires just one number,

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,320
the number that that basis vector landed on.

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,220
This is actually a surprisingly meaningful type of transformation

65
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,920
with close ties to the dot product,

66
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,700
and I'll be talking about that next video.

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,520
Until then, I encourage you to play around with this idea on your own,

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,300
contemplating the meanings of things like matrix multiplication

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,880
and linear systems of equations

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,560
in the context of transformations between different dimensions.

71
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,560
Have fun!
