  "It's perfectly reasonable to talk about transformations between dimensions, such as one that takes 2D vectors to 3D vectors.",

  "Again, what makes one of these linear is that gridlines remain parallel and evenly spaced, and that the origin maps to the origin.",

  "What I have pictured here is the input space on the left, which is just 2D space, and the output of the transformation shown on the right.",

 [
  "The reason I'm not showing the inputs move over to the outputs like I usually do is not just animation laziness, it's worth emphasizing that 2D vector inputs are very different animals from these 3D vector outputs, living in a completely separate, unconnected space.",

  "For example, what you're looking at here is an output of a transformation that takes i-hat to the coordinates 2, negative 1, negative 2, and j-hat to the coordinates 0, 1, 1.",

  "In the language of last video, the column space of this matrix, the place where all the vectors land, is a 2D plane slicing through the origin of 3D space.",

 [
  "But the matrix is still full rank, since the number of dimensions in this column space is the same as the number of dimensions of the input space.",
  127.36,

 ],
 [
  "So if you see a 3x2 matrix out in the wild, you can know that it has the geometric interpretation of mapping two dimensions to three dimensions, since the two columns indicate that the input space has two basis vectors, and the three rows indicate that the landing spots for each of those basis vectors is described with three separate coordinates.",

 [
  "Well, the three columns indicate that you're starting in a space that has three basis vectors, so we're starting in three dimensions, and the two rows indicate that the landing spot for each of those three basis vectors is described with only two coordinates, so they must be landing in two dimensions.",

  "You could also have a transformation from two dimensions to one dimension.",

  "One-dimensional space is really just the number line, so a transformation like this takes in 2D vectors and spits out numbers.",

 [
  "Thinking about grid lines remaining parallel and evenly spaced is a little bit messy due to all of the squishification happening here, so in this case, the visual understanding for what linearity means is that if you have a line of evenly spaced dots, it would remain evenly spaced once they're mapped onto the number line.",

 [
  "One of these transformations is encoded with a 1x2 matrix, each of whose two columns has just a single entry.",

  "The two columns represent where the basis vectors land, and each one of those columns requires just one number, the number that that basis vector landed on.",
