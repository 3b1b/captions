1
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, hello again.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,500
So moving forward, I'll be assuming that you have a visual understanding

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,440
of linear transformations and how they're represented with matrices,

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,840
the way that I've been talking about in the last few videos.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,100
If you think about a couple of these linear transformations,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,460
you might notice how some of them seem to stretch space out,

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,420
while others squish it on in.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,760
One thing that turns out to be pretty useful for understanding one of these transformations

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,920
is to measure exactly how much it stretches or squishes things.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,820
More specifically, to measure the factor by which the area of a given region increases or decreases.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,880
For example, look at the matrix with columns 3, 0 and 0, 2.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,180
It scales i-hat by a factor of 3 and scales j-hat by a factor of 2.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,600
Now, if we focus our attention on the 1 by 1 square whose bottom sits on i-hat

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,480
and whose left side sits on j-hat,

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,520
after the transformation, this turns into a 2 by 3 rectangle.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,980
Since this region started out with area 1 and ended up with area 6,

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,280
we can say the linear transformation has scaled its area by a factor of 6.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,100
Compare that to a shear, whose matrix has columns 1, 0 and 1, 1,

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,100
meaning i-hat stays in place and j-hat moves over to 1, 1.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,480
That same unit square determined by i-hat and j-hat gets slanted and turned into a parallelogram,

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,200
but the area of that parallelogram is still 1,

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,380
since its base and height each continue to have length 1.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,540
So even though this transformation smushes things about, it seems to leave areas unchanged,

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,620
at least in the case of that 1 unit square.

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,500
Actually though, if you know how much the area of that one single unit square changes,

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,520
it can tell you how the area of any possible region in space changes.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,760
For starters, notice that whatever happens to one square in the grid

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,580
has to happen to any other square in the grid, no matter the size.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,040
This follows from the fact that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Then, any shape that's not a grid square can be approximated by grid squares pretty well,

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,520
with arbitrarily good approximations if you use small enough grid squares.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,040
So, since the areas of all those tiny grid squares are being scaled by some single amount,

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,820
the area of the blob as a whole will also be scaled by that same single amount.

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,900
This very special scaling factor, the factor by which a linear transformation changes any area,

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,120
is called the determinant of that transformation.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,300
I'll show how to compute the determinant of a transformation using its matrix later on in this

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,420
video, which is also important in the computation.

38
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,380
For example, the determinant of a transformation would be 3

39
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,040
if that transformation increases the area of a region by a factor of 3.

40
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,340
The determinant of a transformation would be ½ if it squishes down all areas by a factor of ½.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,800
And the determinant of a 2D transformation is 0 if it squishes all of space onto a line,

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,500
or even onto a single point.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,760
Since then, the area of any region would become zero.

44
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,600
That last example will prove to be pretty important.

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,980
It means that checking if the determinant of a given matrix is zero

46
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,440
will give a way of computing whether or not the transformation associated with that matrix

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,740
squishes everything into a smaller dimension.

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,100
You'll see in the next few videos why this is even a useful thing to think about,

49
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,140
but for now, I just want to lay down all of the visual intuition,

50
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,100
which, in and of itself, is a beautiful thing to think about.

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,560
Okay, I need to confess that what I've said so far is not quite right.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,280
The full concept of the determinant allows for negative values.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,480
But what would the idea of scaling an area by a negative amount even mean?

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,960
This has to do with the idea of orientation.

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,680
For example, notice how this transformation gives the sensation of flipping space over.

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,480
If you were thinking of 2D space as a sheet of paper,

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,860
a transformation like that one seems to turn over that sheet onto the other side.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Any transformations that do this are said to invert the orientation of space.

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,600
Another way to think about it is in terms of i-hat and j-hat.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,060
Notice that in their starting positions, j-hat is to the left of i-hat.

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,560
If, after a transformation, j-hat is now on the right of i-hat,

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
the orientation of space has been inverted.

63
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,820
Whenever this happens, whenever the orientation of space is inverted,

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,580
the determinant will be negative.

65
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,620
The absolute value of the determinant, though,

66
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,400
still tells you the factor by which areas have been scaled.

67
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,860
For example, the matrix with columns 1,1 and 2,-1

68
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,680
encodes a transformation that has determinant, I'll just tell you, negative 3.

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,780
And what this means is that space gets flipped over

70
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,280
and areas are scaled by a factor of 3.

71
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,180
So why would this idea of a negative area scaling factor

72
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,700
be a natural way to describe orientation flipping?

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,560
Think about the series of transformations you get

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,140
by slowly letting i-hat get closer and closer to j-hat.

75
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,080
As i-hat gets closer, all of the areas in space are getting squished more and more,

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,100
meaning the determinant approaches 0.

77
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,640
Once i-hat lines up perfectly with j-hat, the determinant is 0.

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,860
Then, if i-hat continues the way that it was going,

79
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,280
doesn't it kind of feel natural for the determinant to keep decreasing into the negative numbers?

80
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,560
So that's the understanding of determinants in two dimensions.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,940
What do you think it should mean for three dimensions?

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,820
It also tells you how much a transformation scales things,

83
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,240
but this time, it tells you how much volumes get scaled.

84
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,140
Just as in two dimensions, where this is easiest to think about

85
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,040
by focusing on one particular square with an area 1

86
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,020
and watching only what happens to it,

87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,100
in three dimensions, it helps to focus your attention

88
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,900
on the specific 1 by 1 by 1 cube

89
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,440
whose edges are resting on the basis vectors, i-hat, j-hat and k-hat.

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,300
After the transformation, that cube might get warped into some kind of slanty slanty cube.

91
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,260
This shape, by the way, has the best name ever, parallelipiped,

92
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,440
a name that's made even more delightful when your professor has a nice thick Russian accent.

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,820
Since this cube starts out with a volume of 1,

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,120
and the determinant gives the factor by which any volume is scaled,

95
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,640
you can think of the determinant simply as being the volume of that parallelipiped that the cube turns into.

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,140
A determinant of 0 would mean that all of space is squished onto something with 0 volume,

97
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,500
meaning either a flat plane, a line, or, in the most extreme case, onto a single point.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,280
Those of you who watched chapter 2 will recognize this as meaning

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,420
that the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent. Can you see why?

100
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,100
What about negative determinants? What should that mean for three dimensions?

101
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,680
One way to describe orientation in 3D is with the right hand rule.

102
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,400
Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of i-hat,

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,320
stick out your middle finger in the direction of j-hat,

104
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,760
and notice how when you point your thumb up, it's in the direction of k-hat.

105
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,900
If you can still do that after the transformation, orientation has not changed, and the determinant is positive.

106
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,880
Otherwise, if after the transformation it only makes sense to do that with your left hand,

107
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,380
orientation has been flipped, and the determinant is negative.

108
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,060
So, if you haven't seen it before, you're probably wondering by now,

109
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,040
how do you actually compute the determinant?

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,420
For a 2x2 matrix with entries a, b, c, d, the formula is a times d minus b times c.

111
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,500
Here's part of an intuition for where this formula comes from.

112
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,780
Let's say that the terms b and c both happened to be 0.

113
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,720
Then, the term a tells you how much i-hat is stretched in the x direction,

114
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,160
and the term d tells you how much j-hat is stretched in the y direction.

115
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,660
So, since those other terms are 0, it should make sense that a times d

116
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,320
gives the area of the rectangle that our favorite unit square turns into,

117
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,360
kind of like the 3, 0, 0, 2 example from earlier.

118
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,760
Even if only one of b or c are 0, you'll have a parallelogram with a base a and a height d.

119
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,500
So, the area should still be a times d.

120
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,400
Loosely speaking, if both b and c are non-zero,

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,480
then that b times c term tells you how much this parallelogram

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,460
is stretched or squished in the diagonal direction.

123
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,100
For those of you hungry for a more precise description of this b times c term,

124
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,880
here's a helpful diagram if you'd like to pause and ponder.

125
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,660
Now, if you feel like computing determinants by hand is something that you need to know,

126
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,200
the only way to get it down is to just practice it with a few.

127
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,180
There's really not that much I can say or animate that's going to drill in the computation.

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,640
This is all triply true for three-dimensional determinants.

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,880
There is a formula, and if you feel like that's something you need to know,

130
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,340
you should practice with a few matrices, or, you know, go watch Sal Khan work through a few.

131
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,640
Honestly, though, I don't think that those computations fall within the essence of linear algebra,

132
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,460
but I definitely think that understanding what the determinant represents falls within that essence.

133
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,640
Here's kind of a fun question to think about before the next video.

134
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,780
If you multiply two matrices together, the determinant of the resulting matrix

135
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,080
is the same as the product of the determinants of the original two matrices.

136
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,280
If you tried to justify this with numbers, it would take a really long time,

137
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,880
but see if you can explain why this makes sense in just one sentence.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,020
Next up, I'll be relating the idea of linear transformations covered so far

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,040
to one of the areas where linear algebra is most useful,

140
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,820
linear systems of equations. See you then!
