1
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:13,520
Hello, hello again.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,520
So moving forward, I'll be assuming that you have a visual understanding

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,920
of linear transformations and how they're represented with matrices,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,740
the way that I've been talking about in the last few videos.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,580
If you think about a couple of these linear transformations,

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,660
you might notice how some of them seem to stretch space out,

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,300
while others squish it on in.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,140
One thing that turns out to be pretty useful for understanding one of these transformations

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,600
is to measure exactly how much it stretches or squishes things.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,280
More specifically, to measure the factor by which the area of a given region increases or decreases.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,480
For example, look at the matrix with columns 3, 0 and 0, 2.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,620
It scales i-hat by a factor of 3 and scales j-hat by a factor of 2.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,760
Now, if we focus our attention on the 1 by 1 square whose bottom sits on i-hat

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
and whose left side sits on j-hat,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,340
after the transformation, this turns into a 2 by 3 rectangle.

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,380
Since this region started out with area 1 and ended up with area 6,

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,160
we can say the linear transformation has scaled its area by a factor of 6.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,420
Compare that to a shear whose matrix has columns 1, 0 and 1, 1,

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,940
meaning i-hat stays in place and j-hat moves over to 1, 1.

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,820
That same unit square determined by i-hat and j-hat gets slanted and turned into a parallelogram,

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,580
but the area of that parallelogram is still 1,

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,140
since its base and height each continue to have length 1.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,780
So, even though this transformation smushes things about, it seems to leave areas unchanged,

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,840
at least in the case of that 1 unit square.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,900
Actually though, if you know how much the area of that one single unit square changes,

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,220
it can tell you how the area of any possible region in space changes.

27
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,100
For starters, notice that whatever happens to one square in the grid

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,540
has to happen to any other square in the grid, no matter the size.

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,980
This follows from the fact that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced.

30
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,900
Then, any shape that's not a grid square can be approximated by grid squares pretty well,

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,060
with arbitrarily good approximations if you use small enough grid squares.

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,420
So, since the areas of all those tiny grid squares are being scaled by some single amount,

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,780
the area of the blob as a whole will also be scaled by that same single amount.

34
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,300
This very special scaling factor, the factor by which a linear transformation changes any area,

35
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,140
is called the determinant of that transformation.

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,820
I'll show how to compute the determinant of a transformation using its matrix later on in this video,

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,700
but understanding what it represents is, trust me,

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,500
much more important than the computation.

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,700
For example, the determinant of a transformation would be 3

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,260
if that transformation increases the area of a region by a factor of 3.

41
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,060
The determinant of a transformation would be 1 half

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,220
if it squishes down all areas by a factor of 1 half.

43
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,380
And the determinant of a 2D transformation is 0

44
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,940
if it squishes all of space onto a line, or even onto a single point.

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,580
Since then, the area of any region would become 0.

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,980
That last example will prove to be pretty important.

47
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,340
It means that checking if the determinant of a given matrix is 0

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,700
will give a way of computing whether or not the transformation associated with that matrix

49
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,500
squishes everything into a smaller dimension.

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,380
You'll see in the next few videos why this is even a useful thing to think about,

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,540
but for now, I just want to lay down all of the visual intuition,

52
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,340
which, in and of itself, is a beautiful thing to think about.

53
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,900
Okay, I need to confess that what I've said so far is not quite right.

54
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,820
The full concept of the determinant allows for negative values.

55
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,100
But what would the idea of scaling an area by a negative amount even mean?

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,860
This has to do with the idea of orientation.

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,360
For example, notice how this transformation gives the sensation of flipping space over.

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,820
If you were thinking of 2D space as a sheet of paper,

59
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,940
a transformation like that one seems to turn over that sheet onto the other side.

60
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,020
Many transformations that do this are said to invert the orientation of space.

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,340
Another way to think about it is in terms of i-hat and j-hat.

62
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,900
Notice that in their starting positions, j-hat is to the left of i-hat.

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,100
If after a transformation, j-hat is now on the right of i-hat,

64
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,380
the orientation of space has been inverted.

65
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,340
Whenever this happens, whenever the orientation of space is inverted,

66
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,960
the determinant will be negative.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,880
The absolute value of the determinant, though,

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,040
still tells you the factor by which areas have been scaled.

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,200
For example, the matrix with columns 1, 1 and 2, negative 1

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,600
encodes a transformation that has determinant, I'll just tell you, negative 3.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
And what this means is that space gets flipped over

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,940
and areas are scaled by a factor of 3.

73
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,440
So why would this idea of a negative area scaling factor

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,760
be a natural way to describe orientation flipping?

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,720
Think about the series of transformations you get

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,680
by slowly letting i-hat get closer and closer to j-hat.

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,320
As i-hat gets closer, all of the areas in space are getting squished more and more,

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,760
meaning the determinant approaches 0.

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,440
Once i-hat lines up perfectly with j-hat, the determinant is 0.

80
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,200
Then, if i-hat continues the way that it was going,

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,160
doesn't it kind of feel natural for the determinant

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,960
to keep decreasing into the negative numbers?

83
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,080
So that's the understanding of determinants in two dimensions.

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,080
What do you think it should mean for three dimensions?

85
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,080
It also tells you how much a transformation scales things,

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,520
but this time it tells you how much volumes get scaled.

87
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,200
Just as in two dimensions, where this is easiest to think about

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,360
by focusing on one particular square with an area 1

89
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,640
and watching only what happens to it,

90
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,560
in three dimensions it helps to focus your attention

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,280
on the specific 1 by 1 by 1 cube

92
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,520
whose edges are resting on the basis vectors i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat.

93
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,400
After the transformation, that cube might get warped

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,280
into some kind of slanty slanty cube.

95
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,840
This shape, by the way, has the best name ever, parallel a pipette,

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
a name that's made even more delightful

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,480
when your professor has a nice thick Russian accent.

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,200
Since this cube starts out with a volume of 1

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,640
and the determinant gives the factor by which any volume is scaled,

100
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,680
you can think of the determinant simply as being the volume

101
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,680
of that parallel a pipette that the cube turns into.

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,080
A determinant of 0 would mean that all of space

103
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,680
is squished onto something with 0 volume,

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,560
meaning either a flat plane, a line, or, in the most extreme case,

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,720
onto a single point.

106
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,280
Those of you who watched chapter 2 will recognize this as meaning

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,840
that the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent.

108
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,380
Can you see why?

109
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,920
What about negative determinants?

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
What should that mean for three dimensions?

111
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,440
One way to describe orientation in 3D is with the right hand rule.

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,000
Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of i-hat,

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,840
stick out your middle finger in the direction of j-hat,

114
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,340
and notice how when you point your thumb up, it's in the direction of k-hat.

115
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,640
If you can still do that after the transformation,

116
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,440
orientation has not changed, and the determinant is positive.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,480
Otherwise, if after the transformation it only makes sense

118
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,080
to do that with your left hand, orientation has been flipped,

119
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,200
and the determinant is negative.

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,440
So if you haven't seen it before, you're probably wondering by now,

121
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,640
how do you actually compute the determinant?

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:46,160
For a 2x2 matrix with entries a, b, c, d, the formula is a times d minus b times c.

123
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
Here's part of an intuition for where this formula comes from.

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,660
Let's say that the terms b and c both happened to be 0.

125
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,380
Then the term a tells you how much i-hat is stretched in the x direction,

126
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,860
and the term d tells you how much j-hat is stretched in the y direction.

127
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,980
So since those other terms are 0, it should make sense that a times d

128
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,700
gives the area of the rectangle that our favorite unit square turns into,

129
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,740
kind of like the 3, 0, 0, 2 example from earlier.

130
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,700
Even if only one of b or c are 0, you'll have a parallelogram with a base a

131
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,340
and a height d, so the area should still be a times d.

132
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,580
Loosely speaking, if both b and c are non-zero, then that b times c term

133
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,740
tells you how much this parallelogram is stretched or squished in the diagonal direction.

134
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,620
For those of you hungry for a more precise description of this b times c term,

135
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,140
here's a helpful diagram if you'd like to pause and ponder.

136
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,340
Now if you feel like computing determinants by hand is something that you need to know,

137
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,780
the only way to get it down is to just practice it with a few.

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,220
There's really not that much I can say or animate that's going to drill in the computation.

139
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,220
This is all triply true for three-dimensional determinants.

140
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,220
There is a formula, and if you feel like that's something you need to know,

141
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,820
you should practice with a few matrices, or, you know, go watch Sal Khan work through a few.

142
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,140
Honestly, though, I don't think that those computations fall within the essence of linear algebra,

143
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,940
but I definitely think that understanding what the determinant represents falls within that essence.

144
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,940
Here's kind of a fun question to think about before the next video.

145
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,980
If you multiply two matrices together, the determinant of the resulting matrix

146
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,820
is the same as the product of the determinants of the original two matrices.

147
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,420
If you tried to justify this with numbers, it would take a really long time,

148
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,340
but see if you can explain why this makes sense in just one sentence.

149
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,180
Next up, I'll be relating the idea of linear transformations covered so far

150
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,180
to one of the areas where linear algebra is most useful, linear systems of equations.

151
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
See you then!
