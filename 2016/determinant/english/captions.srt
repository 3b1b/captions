00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, hello again.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,526
So moving forward, I'll be assuming that you have a visual understanding 

3
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:19,368
of linear transformations and how they're represented with matrices, 

4
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,840
the way that I've been talking about in the last few videos.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,794
If you think about a couple of these linear transformations, 

6
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:30,420
you might notice how some of them seem to stretch space out, while others squish it on in.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,954
One thing that turns out to be pretty useful for understanding one of these 

8
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:38,920
transformations is to measure exactly how much it stretches or squishes things.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,670
More specifically, to measure the factor by which 

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,820
the area of a given region increases or decreases.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,880
For example, look at the matrix with columns 3, 0 and 0, 2.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,180
It scales i-hat by a factor of 3 and scales j-hat by a factor of 2.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,202
Now, if we focus our attention on the 1 by 1 square whose bottom sits on i-hat and whose 

14
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:07,520
left side sits on j-hat, after the transformation, this turns into a 2 by 3 rectangle.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,641
Since this region started out with area 1 and ended up with area 6, 

16
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:17,280
we can say the linear transformation has scaled its area by a factor of 6.

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,172
Compare that to a shear, whose matrix has columns 1, 0 and 1, 

18
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:26,100
1, meaning i-hat stays in place and j-hat moves over to 1, 1.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,661
That same unit square determined by i-hat and j-hat gets slanted 

20
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:35,168
and turned into a parallelogram, but the area of that parallelogram is still 1, 

21
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:38,380
since its base and height each continue to have length 1.

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,899
So even though this transformation smushes things about, 

23
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:45,620
it seems to leave areas unchanged, at least in the case of that 1 unit square.

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,671
Actually though, if you know how much the area of that one single unit square changes, 

25
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:55,520
it can tell you how the area of any possible region in space changes.

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,020
For starters, notice that whatever happens to one square in the grid 

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,580
has to happen to any other square in the grid, no matter the size.

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,039
This follows from the fact that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced.

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,567
Then, any shape that's not a grid square can be approximated by grid squares pretty well, 

30
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,520
with arbitrarily good approximations if you use small enough grid squares.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,548
So, since the areas of all those tiny grid squares are being scaled by some single 

32
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:27,820
amount, the area of the blob as a whole will also be scaled by that same single amount.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,321
This very special scaling factor, the factor by which a linear transformation 

34
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,120
changes any area, is called the determinant of that transformation.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,673
I'll show how to compute the determinant of a transformation using its 

36
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:48,420
matrix later on in this video, which is also important in the computation.

37
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,167
For example, the determinant of a transformation would be 3 if 

38
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:57,040
that transformation increases the area of a region by a factor of 3.

39
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,260
The determinant of a transformation would be ½ 

40
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,340
if it squishes down all areas by a factor of ½.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,705
And the determinant of a 2D transformation is 0 if it squishes all of space onto a line, 

42
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,500
or even onto a single point.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,760
Since then, the area of any region would become zero.

44
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,600
That last example will prove to be pretty important.

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,260
It means that checking if the determinant of a given matrix is zero 

46
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,261
will give a way of computing whether or not the transformation 

47
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,740
associated with that matrix squishes everything into a smaller dimension.

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,278
You'll see in the next few videos why this is even a useful thing to think about, 

49
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:37,303
but for now, I just want to lay down all of the visual intuition, 

50
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:40,100
which, in and of itself, is a beautiful thing to think about.

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,560
Okay, I need to confess that what I've said so far is not quite right.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,280
The full concept of the determinant allows for negative values.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,480
But what would the idea of scaling an area by a negative amount even mean?

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,960
This has to do with the idea of orientation.

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,680
For example, notice how this transformation gives the sensation of flipping space over.

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,888
If you were thinking of 2D space as a sheet of paper, 

57
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:09,860
a transformation like that one seems to turn over that sheet onto the other side.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Any transformations that do this are said to invert the orientation of space.

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,600
Another way to think about it is in terms of i-hat and j-hat.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,060
Notice that in their starting positions, j-hat is to the left of i-hat.

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,555
If, after a transformation, j-hat is now on the right of i-hat, 

62
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:30,200
the orientation of space has been inverted.

63
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,151
Whenever this happens, whenever the orientation of space is inverted, 

64
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,580
the determinant will be negative.

65
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,650
The absolute value of the determinant, though, 

66
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,400
still tells you the factor by which areas have been scaled.

67
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,610
For example, the matrix with columns 1,1 and 2,-1 encodes a 

68
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,680
transformation that has determinant, I'll just tell you, negative 3.

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,280
And what this means is that space gets flipped over and areas are scaled by a factor of 3.

70
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,546
So why would this idea of a negative area scaling 

71
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:03,700
factor be a natural way to describe orientation flipping?

72
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,227
Think about the series of transformations you get by 

73
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:10,140
slowly letting i-hat get closer and closer to j-hat.

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,149
As i-hat gets closer, all of the areas in space are getting squished more and more, 

75
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,100
meaning the determinant approaches 0.

76
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,640
Once i-hat lines up perfectly with j-hat, the determinant is 0.

77
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,827
Then, if i-hat continues the way that it was going, 

78
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:28,315
doesn't it kind of feel natural for the determinant to keep decreasing into 

79
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:29,280
the negative numbers?

80
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,560
So that's the understanding of determinants in two dimensions.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,940
What do you think it should mean for three dimensions?

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,162
It also tells you how much a transformation scales things, 

83
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:43,240
but this time, it tells you how much volumes get scaled.

84
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,777
Just as in two dimensions, where this is easiest to think about by focusing 

85
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:54,331
on one particular square with an area 1 and watching only what happens to it, 

86
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:58,827
in three dimensions, it helps to focus your attention on the specific 1 by 1 

87
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:03,440
by 1 cube whose edges are resting on the basis vectors, i-hat, j-hat and k-hat.

88
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,300
After the transformation, that cube might get warped into some kind of slanty slanty cube.

89
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,252
This shape, by the way, has the best name ever, parallelipiped, 

90
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:16,757
a name that's made even more delightful when your professor has a nice thick 

91
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:17,440
Russian accent.

92
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,074
Since this cube starts out with a volume of 1, 

93
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:24,770
and the determinant gives the factor by which any volume is scaled, 

94
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,466
you can think of the determinant simply as being the volume of that 

95
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,640
parallelipiped that the cube turns into.

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,525
A determinant of 0 would mean that all of space is squished onto something with 0 volume, 

97
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:42,500
meaning either a flat plane, a line, or, in the most extreme case, onto a single point.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,408
Those of you who watched chapter 2 will recognize this as 

99
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,240
meaning that the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent.

100
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,420
Can you see why?

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,640
What about negative determinants?

102
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,100
What should that mean for three dimensions?

103
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,680
One way to describe orientation in 3D is with the right hand rule.

104
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,485
Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of i-hat, 

105
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,147
stick out your middle finger in the direction of j-hat, 

106
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:12,760
and notice how when you point your thumb up, it's in the direction of k-hat.

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,621
If you can still do that after the transformation, 

108
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,900
orientation has not changed, and the determinant is positive.

109
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,383
Otherwise, if after the transformation it only makes sense to do that with 

110
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:29,380
your left hand, orientation has been flipped, and the determinant is negative.

111
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,038
So, if you haven't seen it before, you're probably wondering by now, 

112
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,040
how do you actually compute the determinant?

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,420
For a 2x2 matrix with entries a, b, c, d, the formula is a times d minus b times c.

114
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,500
Here's part of an intuition for where this formula comes from.

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,780
Let's say that the terms b and c both happened to be 0.

116
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,565
Then, the term a tells you how much i-hat is stretched in the x direction, 

117
00:07:56,565 --> 00:08:01,160
and the term d tells you how much j-hat is stretched in the y direction.

118
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,202
So, since those other terms are 0, it should make sense that a 

119
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:10,682
times d gives the area of the rectangle that our favorite unit square turns into, 

120
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:13,360
kind of like the 3, 0, 0, 2 example from earlier.

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,595
Even if only one of b or c are 0, you'll have 

122
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:21,760
a parallelogram with a base a and a height d.

123
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,500
So, the area should still be a times d.

124
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,422
Loosely speaking, if both b and c are non-zero, 

125
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:33,299
then that b times c term tells you how much this parallelogram is stretched or 

126
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,460
squished in the diagonal direction.

127
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,220
For those of you hungry for a more precise description of this b times c term, 

128
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,880
here's a helpful diagram if you'd like to pause and ponder.

129
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,235
Now, if you feel like computing determinants by hand is something that you need to know, 

130
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:51,200
the only way to get it down is to just practice it with a few.

131
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,386
There's really not that much I can say or animate 

132
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:55,180
that's going to drill in the computation.

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,640
This is all triply true for three-dimensional determinants.

134
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,342
There is a formula, and if you feel like that's something you need to know, 

135
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,732
you should practice with a few matrices, or, you know, 

136
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:06,340
go watch Sal Khan work through a few.

137
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,390
Honestly, though, I don't think that those computations fall within 

138
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,124
the essence of linear algebra, but I definitely think that 

139
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:16,460
understanding what the determinant represents falls within that essence.

140
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,640
Here's kind of a fun question to think about before the next video.

141
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,451
If you multiply two matrices together, the determinant of the resulting matrix 

142
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:30,080
is the same as the product of the determinants of the original two matrices.

143
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,675
If you tried to justify this with numbers, it would take a really long time, 

144
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,880
but see if you can explain why this makes sense in just one sentence.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,710
Next up, I'll be relating the idea of linear transformations covered so far to 

146
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,600
one of the areas where linear algebra is most useful, linear systems of equations.
