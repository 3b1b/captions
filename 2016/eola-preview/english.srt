00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,440
Hey everyone! So I'm pretty excited about the next sequence of videos that I'm doing.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,880
They'll be about linear algebra, which, as a lot of you know, is one of those subjects

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,200
that's required knowledge for just about any technical discipline, but it's also,

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,080
I've noticed, generally poorly understood by students taking it for the first time.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
A student might go through a class and learn how to compute lots of things, like matrix

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,000
multiplication, or the determinant, or cross products, which use the determinant, or eigenvalues,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,800
but they might come out without really understanding why matrix multiplication is defined the way

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,200
that it is, why the cross product has anything to do with the determinant, or what an eigenvalue

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,240
really represents. Oftentimes, students end up well-practiced in the numerical operations

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,620
of matrices, but are only vaguely aware of the geometric intuitions underlying it all.

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,180
But there's a fundamental difference between understanding linear algebra on a numeric

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,860
level and understanding it on a geometric level. Each has its place, but roughly speaking,

13
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,840
the geometric understanding is what lets you judge what tools to use to solve specific

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,680
problems, feel why they work, and know how to interpret the results, and the numeric

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,480
understanding is what lets you actually carry through the application of those tools.

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,240
Now, if you learn linear algebra without getting a solid foundation in that geometric understanding,

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,260
the problems can go unnoticed for a while until you've gone deeper into whatever field

18
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,600
you happen to pursue, whether that's computer science, engineering, statistics, economics,

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,320
or even math itself. Once you're in a class, or a job for that matter, that assumes fluency

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,700
with linear algebra, the way that your professors or your coworkers apply that field could seem

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,000
like utter magic. They'll very quickly know what the right tool to use is and what the

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,660
answer roughly looks like in a way that would seem like computational wizardry if you assume

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,800
that they're actually crunching all the numbers in their head.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,720
Here, as an analogy, imagine that when you first learned about the sine function in trigonometry,

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,800
you were shown this infinite polynomial. This, by the way, is how your calculator evaluates

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,240
the sine function. For homework, you might be asked to practice computing approximations

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,120
of the sine function by plugging in various numbers to the formula and cutting it off

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,160
at a reasonable point. And in fairness, let's say you had a vague idea that this was supposed

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,960
to be related to triangles, but exactly how had never really been clear and was just not

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,900
the focus of the course. Later on, if you took a physics course, where sines and cosines

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,740
are thrown around left and right, and people are able to tell pretty immediately how to

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,100
apply them and roughly what the sine of a certain value will be, it would be pretty

33
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,160
intimidating, wouldn't it? It would make it seem like the only people who are cut out

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,280
for physics are those with computers for brains, and you would feel unduly slow or dumb for

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,720
taking so long on each problem. It's not that different with linear algebra,

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,500
and luckily, just as with trigonometry, there are a handful of intuitions, visual intuitions,

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,860
underlying much of the subject. And unlike the trig example, the connection between the

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,880
computation and these visual intuitions is typically pretty straightforward. And when

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,300
you digest these and really understand the relationship between the geometry and the

40
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,820
numbers, the details of the subject, as well as how it's used in practice, start to feel

41
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,900
a lot more reasonable. In fairness, most professors do make an effort

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,180
to convey that geometric understanding. The sine example is a little extreme. But I do

43
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,100
think that a lot of courses have students spending a disproportionate amount of time

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,700
on the numerical side of things, especially given that in this day and age, we almost

45
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,720
always get computers to handle that half, while in practice, humans worry about the

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,940
conceptual half. So this brings me to the upcoming videos.

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,380
The goal is to create a short, binge-watchable series animating those intuitions from the

48
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,340
basics of vectors up through the core topics that make up the essence of linear algebra.

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,460
I'll put out one video per day for the next five days, then after that put out a new chapter

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,900
every one to two weeks. I think it should go without saying that you cannot learn a

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,260
full subject with a short series of videos, and that's just not the goal here. But what

52
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,580
you can do, especially with this subject, is lay down all the right intuitions so the

53
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,740
learning that you do moving forward is as productive and fruitful as it can be.

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,500
I also hope this can be a resource for educators who are teaching courses that assume fluency

55
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,340
with linear algebra, giving them a place to direct students that need a quick brush-up.

56
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,600
I'll do what I can to keep things well-paced throughout, but it's hard to simultaneously

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,000
account for different people's different backgrounds and levels of comfort, so I do encourage you

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,940
to readily pause and ponder if you feel that it's necessary.

59
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,380
Actually, I'd give that same advice for watching any math video, even if it doesn't feel too

60
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,300
quick, since the thinking that you do on your own time is where all the learning really

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,540
happens, don't you think?

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,900
So with that as an introduction, I'll see you next video.
