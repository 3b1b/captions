00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,980
Hey everyone!

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,260
So I'm pretty excited about the next sequence of videos that I'm doing.

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,864
They'll be about linear algebra, which, as a lot of you know, 

4
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:23,896
is one of those subjects that's required knowledge for just about any technical 

5
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:27,978
discipline, but it's also, I've noticed, generally poorly understood by students 

6
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:29,440
taking it for the first time.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,290
A student might go through a class and learn how to compute lots of things, 

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,984
like matrix multiplication, or the determinant, or cross products, 

9
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:42,506
which use the determinant, or eigenvalues, but they might come out without really 

10
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:46,420
understanding why matrix multiplication is defined the way that it is, 

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,894
why the cross product has anything to do with the determinant, 

12
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:52,100
or what an eigenvalue really represents.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,290
Oftentimes, students end up well practiced in the numerical operations of matrices, 

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,020
but are only vaguely aware of the geometric intuitions underlying it all.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,519
But there's a fundamental difference between understanding linear 

16
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,740
algebra on a numeric level and understanding it on a geometric level.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,244
Each has its place, but, roughly speaking, the geometric understanding is 

18
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:15,940
what lets you judge what tools to use to solve specific problems, 

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,244
feel why they work, and know how to interpret the results, 

20
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:23,388
and the numeric understanding is what lets you actually carry through the 

21
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:24,900
application of those tools.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,668
Now, if you learn linear algebra without getting a solid foundation in that 

23
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:33,692
geometric understanding, the problems can go unnoticed for a while until 

24
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:37,054
you've gone deeper into whatever field you happen to pursue, 

25
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:41,960
whether that's computer science, engineering, statistics, economics, or even math itself.

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,415
Once you're in a class, or a job for that matter, 

27
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,626
that assumes fluency with linear algebra, the way that your 

28
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:52,640
professors or your co-workers apply that field could seem like utter magic.

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,366
They'll very quickly know what the right tool to use is and what the answer 

30
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,748
roughly looks like in a way that would seem like computational wizardry if 

31
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:03,040
you assume that they're actually crunching all the numbers in their head.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,992
Here, as an analogy, imagine that when you first learned about the 

33
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:11,800
sine function in trigonometry, you were shown this infinite polynomial.

34
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,540
This, by the way, is how your calculator evaluates the sine function.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,908
For homework, you might be asked to practice computing approximations of the sine 

36
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:23,913
function by plugging in various numbers to the formula and cutting it off at a reasonable 

37
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:24,180
point.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,450
And in fairness, let's say you had a vague idea that this was 

39
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,326
supposed to be related to triangles, but exactly how had never 

40
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:34,020
really been clear and was just not the focus of the course.

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,800
Later on, if you took a physics course where sines and cosines are thrown around left 

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,149
and right and people are able to tell pretty immediately how to apply them and roughly 

43
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:47,500
what the sign of a certain value will be, it would be pretty intimidating, wouldn't it?

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,793
It would make it seem like the only people who are cut out 

45
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:53,130
for physics are those with computers for brains, 

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,660
and you would feel unduly slow or dumb for taking so long on each problem.

47
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,100
It's not that different with linear algebra, and luckily, just as with trigonometry, 

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,700
there are a handful of intuitions, visual intuitions, underlying much of the subject.

49
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,591
And unlike the trig example, the connection between the computation 

50
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,840
and these visual intuitions is typically pretty straightforward.

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,780
And when you digest these and really understand the relationship 

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,070
between the geometry and the numbers, the details of the subject, 

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,760
as well as how it's used in practice, start to feel a lot more reasonable.

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,580
In fairness, most professors do make an effort to convey that geometric understanding.

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,400
The sine example is a little extreme.

56
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,929
But I do think that a lot of courses have students spending a 

57
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:38,104
disproportionate amount of time on the numerical side of things, 

58
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:41,720
especially given that in this day and age, we almost always get computers 

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,580
to handle that half, while in practice, humans worry about the conceptual half.

60
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,460
So this brings me to the upcoming videos.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,369
The goal is to create a short, binge-watchable series animating those intuitions from the 

62
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:57,760
basics of vectors up through the core topics that make up the essence of linear algebra.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,730
I'll put out one video per day for the next five days, 

64
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,560
then after that put out a new chapter every one to two weeks.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,209
I think it should go without saying that you cannot learn a full 

66
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,680
subject with a short series of videos, and that's just not the goal here.

67
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,968
But what you can do, especially with this subject, 

68
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:18,940
is lay down all the right intuitions so the learning that you do moving forward is as 

69
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,079
productive and fruitful as it can be.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,212
I also hope this can be a resource for educators who are 

71
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,666
teaching courses that assume fluency with linear algebra, 

72
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,460
giving them a place to direct students that need a quick brush up.

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,955
I'll do what I can to keep things well paced throughout, 

74
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:36,885
but it's hard to simultaneously account for different people's different backgrounds 

75
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,584
and levels of comfort, so I do encourage you to readily pause and ponder if you 

76
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:41,740
feel that it's necessary.

77
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,331
Actually, I'd give that same advice for watching any math video, 

78
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,379
even if it doesn't feel too quick, since the thinking that you do on 

79
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,560
your own time is where all the learning really happens, don't you think?

80
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,540
So with that as an introduction, I'll see you next video.
