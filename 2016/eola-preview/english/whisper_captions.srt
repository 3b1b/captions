00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,260
Hey everyone! So I'm pretty excited about the next sequence of videos that I'm doing.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,840
They'll be about linear algebra, which, as a lot of you know, is one of those subjects

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,020
that's required knowledge for just about any technical discipline, but it's also,

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,440
I've noticed, generally poorly understood by students taking it for the first time.

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,520
A student might go through a class and learn how to compute lots of things, like matrix

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,280
multiplication, or the determinant, or cross products, which use the determinant, or eigenvalues,

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,840
but they might come out without really understanding why matrix multiplication

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,740
is defined the way that it is, why the cross product has anything to do with the determinant,

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,800
or what an eigenvalue really represents. Oftentimes, students end up well practiced

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,820
in the numerical operations of matrices, but are only vaguely aware of the geometric intuitions

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,460
underlying it all. But there's a fundamental difference between understanding linear algebra

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,460
on a numeric level and understanding it on a geometric level. Each has its place, but,

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,980
roughly speaking, the geometric understanding is what lets you judge what tools to use to solve

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,540
specific problems, feel why they work, and know how to interpret the results,

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,500
and the numeric understanding is what lets you actually carry through the application of those

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,060
tools. Now, if you learn linear algebra without getting a solid foundation in that geometric

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,920
understanding, the problems can go unnoticed for a while until you've gone deeper into whatever

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,720
field you happen to pursue, whether that's computer science, engineering, statistics,

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,100
economics, or even math itself. Once you're in a class, or a job for that matter,

20
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,520
that assumes fluency with linear algebra, the way that your professors or your co-workers apply

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,460
that field could seem like utter magic. They'll very quickly know what the right tool to use is

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,340
and what the answer roughly looks like in a way that would seem like computational wizardry if

23
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,540
you assume that they're actually crunching all the numbers in their head. Here, as an analogy,

24
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,180
imagine that when you first learned about the sine function in trigonometry, you were shown

25
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,540
this infinite polynomial. This, by the way, is how your calculator evaluates the sine function.

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,120
For homework, you might be asked to practice computing approximations of the sine function

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,180
by plugging in various numbers to the formula and cutting it off at a reasonable point.

28
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,440
And in fairness, let's say you had a vague idea that this was supposed to be related to triangles,

29
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,020
but exactly how had never really been clear and was just not the focus of the course.

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Later on, if you took a physics course where sines and cosines are thrown around left and right

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,800
and people are able to tell pretty immediately how to apply them and roughly what the sign of

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,640
a certain value will be, it would be pretty intimidating, wouldn't it? It would make it

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,640
seem like the only people who are cut out for physics are those with computers for brains,

34
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,660
and you would feel unduly slow or dumb for taking so long on each problem.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,380
It's not that different with linear algebra, and luckily, just as with trigonometry,

36
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,700
there are a handful of intuitions, visual intuitions, underlying much of the subject.

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,140
And unlike the trig example, the connection between the computation and these visual intuitions

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,420
is typically pretty straightforward. And when you digest these and really understand the

39
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,300
relationship between the geometry and the numbers, the details of the subject,

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,760
as well as how it's used in practice, start to feel a lot more reasonable.

41
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,580
In fairness, most professors do make an effort to convey that geometric understanding.

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,880
The sine example is a little extreme. But I do think that a lot of courses have students

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,980
spending a disproportionate amount of time on the numerical side of things, especially given that

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,640
in this day and age, we almost always get computers to handle that half, while in practice,

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,460
humans worry about the conceptual half. So this brings me to the upcoming videos.

46
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,740
The goal is to create a short, binge-watchable series animating those intuitions from the basics

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,820
of vectors up through the core topics that make up the essence of linear algebra. I'll put out

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,220
one video per day for the next five days, then after that put out a new chapter every one to two

49
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,220
weeks. I think it should go without saying that you cannot learn a full subject with a short

50
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,160
series of videos, and that's just not the goal here. But what you can do, especially with this

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,000
subject, is lay down all the right intuitions so the learning that you do moving forward is as

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,100
productive and fruitful as it can be. I also hope this can be a resource for educators who are

53
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,200
teaching courses that assume fluency with linear algebra, giving them a place to direct students

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,660
that need a quick brush up. I'll do what I can to keep things well paced throughout, but it's hard

55
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,580
to simultaneously account for different people's different backgrounds and levels of comfort,

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,280
so I do encourage you to readily pause and ponder if you feel that it's necessary. Actually, I'd give

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,740
that same advice for watching any math video, even if it doesn't feel too quick, since the thinking

58
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,920
that you do on your own time is where all the learning really happens, don't you think? So with

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,040
that as an introduction, I'll see you next video.
