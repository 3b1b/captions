1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,191
In the last video, along with the ideas of vector addition and scalar multiplication, 

2
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,952
I described vector coordinates, where there's this back and forth between, 

3
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,860
for example, pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,036
Now, I imagine the vector coordinates were already familiar to a lot of you, 

5
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:30,314
but there's another kind of interesting way to think about these coordinates, 

6
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,080
which is pretty central to linear algebra.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,547
When you have a pair of numbers that's meant to describe a vector, 

8
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:40,698
like 3, negative 2, I want you to think about each coordinate as a scalar, 

9
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:44,240
meaning, think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,841
In the xy coordinate system, there are two very special vectors, 

11
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,712
the one pointing to the right with length 1, commonly called i-hat, 

12
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:57,666
or the unit vector in the x direction, and the one pointing straight up with length 1, 

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,140
commonly called j-hat, or the unit vector in the y direction.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,772
Now, think of the x coordinate of our vector as a scalar that scales i-hat, 

15
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:11,560
stretching it by a factor of 3, and the y coordinate as a scalar that scales j-hat, 

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,240
flipping it and stretching it by a factor of 2.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,820
In this sense, the vector that these coordinates 

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,340
describe is the sum of two scaled vectors.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,560
That's a surprisingly important concept, this idea of adding together two scaled vectors.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,440
Those two vectors, i-hat and j-hat, have a special name, by the way.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,560
Together, they're called the basis of a coordinate system.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,300
What this means, basically, is that when you think about coordinates as scalars, 

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,660
the basis vectors are what those scalars actually, you know, scale.

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,660
There's also a more technical definition, but I'll get to that later.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,352
By framing our coordinate system in terms of these two special basis vectors, 

26
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,920
it raises a pretty interesting and subtle point.

27
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,371
We could have chosen different basis vectors and 

28
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:00,520
gotten a completely reasonable new coordinate system.

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,763
For example, take some vector pointing up and to the right, 

30
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:06,960
along with some other vector pointing down and to the right in some way.

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,437
Take a moment to think about all the different vectors that you can get by choosing two 

32
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:17,200
scalars, using each one to scale one of the vectors, then adding together what you get.

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,500
Which two-dimensional vectors can you reach by altering the choices of scalars?

34
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,168
The answer is that you can reach every possible two-dimensional vector, 

35
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,660
and I think it's a good puzzle to contemplate why.

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,822
A new pair of basis vectors like this still gives us a valid way to go back and forth 

37
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,649
between pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors, 

38
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:44,099
but the association is definitely different from the one that you get using the more 

39
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,880
standard basis of i-hat and j-hat.

40
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,325
This is something I'll go into much more detail on later, 

41
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:52,882
describing the exact relationship between different coordinate systems, 

42
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:56,587
but for right now, I just want you to appreciate the fact that any time we 

43
00:02:56,587 --> 00:03:00,391
describe vectors numerically, it depends on an implicit choice of what basis 

44
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,380
vectors we're using.

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,972
So any time that you're scaling two vectors and adding them like this, 

46
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,720
it's called a linear combination of those two vectors.

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,660
Where does this word linear come from?

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
Why does this have anything to do with lines?

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,449
Well, this isn't the etymology, but one way I like to think about it 

50
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,873
is that if you fix one of those scalars and let the other one change its value freely, 

51
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:25,620
the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line.

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,511
Now, if you let both scalars range freely and consider every possible 

53
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,480
vector that you can get, there are two things that can happen.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,120
For most pairs of vectors, you'll be able to reach every possible point in the plane.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,940
Every two-dimensional vector is within your grasp.

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,582
However, in the unlucky case where your two original vectors happen to line up, 

57
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:52,008
the tip of the resulting vector is limited to just this single line passing through the 

58
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:52,360
origin.

59
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,120
Actually, technically there's a third possibility too.

60
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,160
Both your vectors could be zero, in which case you'd just be stuck at the origin.

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,380
Here's some more terminology.

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,171
The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination 

63
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:10,940
of a given pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,283
So restating what we just saw in this lingo, the span of most 

65
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:22,409
pairs of 2D vectors is all vectors of 2D space, but when they line up, 

66
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,780
their span is all vectors whose tip sit on a certain line.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,280
Remember how I said that linear algebra revolves 

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,400
around vector addition and scalar multiplication?

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,410
Well, the span of two vectors is basically a way of asking what 

70
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,155
are all the possible vectors you can reach using only these two fundamental operations, 

71
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,420
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,220
This is a good time to talk about how people commonly think about vectors as points.

73
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,931
It gets really crowded to think about a whole collection of vectors sitting on a line, 

74
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:55,556
and more crowded still to think about all two-dimensional vectors all at once, 

75
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:56,520
filling up the plane.

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,123
So when dealing with collections of vectors like this, 

77
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:03,397
it's common to represent each one with just a point in space, 

78
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:06,195
the point at the tip of that vector where, as usual, 

79
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:09,680
I want you thinking about that vector with its tail on the origin.

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,067
That way, if you want to think about every possible vector whose 

81
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:17,340
tip sits on a certain line, just think about the line itself.

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,237
Likewise, to think about all possible two-dimensional vectors all at once, 

83
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:27,360
conceptualize each one as the point where its tip sits.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,790
So in effect, what you'll be thinking about is the infinite flat 

85
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,380
sheet of two-dimensional space itself, leaving the arrows out of it.

86
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,740
In general, if you're thinking about a vector on its own, think of it as an arrow.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,397
And if you're dealing with a collection of vectors, 

88
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:44,420
it's convenient to think of them all as points.

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,687
So for our span example, the span of most pairs of vectors ends 

90
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,920
up being the entire infinite sheet of two-dimensional space.

91
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,880
But if they line up, their span is just a line.

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,659
The idea of span gets a lot more interesting if we 

93
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,360
start thinking about vectors in three-dimensional space.

94
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,250
For example, if you take two vectors in 3D space that are not 

95
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,780
pointing in the same direction, what does it mean to take their span?

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,346
Well, their span is the collection of all possible linear combinations 

97
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:21,295
of those two vectors, meaning all possible vectors you get by scaling 

98
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:25,020
each of the two of them in some way and then adding them together.

99
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,957
You can kind of imagine turning two different knobs to change 

100
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:31,469
the two scalars defining the linear combination, 

101
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:35,160
adding the scaled vectors and following the tip of the resulting vector.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,430
That tip will trace out some kind of flat sheet 

103
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,120
cutting through the origin of three-dimensional space.

104
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,560
This flat sheet is the span of the two vectors.

105
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,101
Or more precisely, the set of all possible vectors whose 

106
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:51,240
tips sit on that flat sheet is the span of your two vectors.

107
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,360
Isn't that a beautiful mental image?

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,946
So, what happens if we add a third vector and 

109
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,360
consider the span of all three of those guys?

110
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,004
A linear combination of three vectors is defined 

111
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,980
pretty much the same way as it is for two.

112
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,130
You'll choose three different scalars, scale each of those vectors, 

113
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,840
and then add them all together.

114
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,960
And again, the span of these vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations.

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,960
Two different things could happen here.

116
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,055
If your third vector happens to be sitting on the span of the first two, 

117
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,540
then the span doesn't change.

118
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,940
You're sort of trapped on that same flat sheet.

119
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,785
In other words, adding a scaled version of that third vector to the 

120
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:41,120
linear combination doesn't really give you access to any new vectors.

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,988
But if you just randomly choose a third vector, 

122
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:48,060
it's almost certainly not sitting on the span of those first two.

123
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,259
Then, since it's pointing in a separate direction, 

124
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,320
it unlocks access to every possible three-dimensional vector.

125
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,889
One way I like to think about this is that as you scale that new third vector, 

126
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,480
it moves around that span sheet of the first two, sweeping it through all of space.

127
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,162
Another way to think about it is that you're making full use of the three freely changing 

128
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:14,140
scalars that you have at your disposal to access the full three dimensions of space.

129
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,065
Now, in the case where the third vector was already sitting on the span of the first two, 

130
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,475
or the case where two vectors happen to line up, 

131
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:27,605
we want some terminology to describe the fact that at least one of these vectors is 

132
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,720
redundant, not adding anything to our span.

133
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,144
Whenever this happens, where you have multiple vectors and you could remove one without 

134
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:39,419
reducing the span, the relevant terminology is to say that they are linearly dependent.

135
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,578
Another way of phrasing that would be to say that one of the vectors can be expressed 

136
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:48,680
as a linear combination of the others, since it's already in the span of the others.

137
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,424
On the other hand, if each vector really does add another dimension to the span, 

138
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,620
they're said to be linearly independent.

139
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,376
So with all of that terminology, and hopefully with some good mental 

140
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:12,280
images to go with it, let me leave you with a puzzle before we go.

141
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,048
The technical definition of a basis of a space is a 

142
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:20,180
set of linearly independent vectors that span that space.

143
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,925
Now, given how I described a basis earlier, and given your current understanding of the 

144
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:31,700
words span and linearly independent, think about why this definition would make sense.

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,880
In the next video, I'll get into matrices in transforming space.
