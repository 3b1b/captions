1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,740
In the last video, along with the ideas of vector addition and scalar multiplication,

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
I described vector coordinates, where there's this back and forth between, for example,

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,860
pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,180
Now, I imagine the vector coordinates were already familiar to a lot of you,

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,160
but there's another kind of interesting way to think about these coordinates,

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,080
which is pretty central to linear algebra.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,980
When you have a pair of numbers that's meant to describe a vector, like 3, negative 2,

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,600
I want you to think about each coordinate as a scalar,

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,240
meaning, think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,500
In the xy coordinate system, there are two very special vectors,

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,380
the one pointing to the right with length 1, commonly called i-hat,

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
or the unit vector in the x direction,

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,900
and the one pointing straight up with length 1, commonly called j-hat,

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
or the unit vector in the y direction.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,640
Now, think of the x coordinate of our vector as a scalar that scales i-hat,

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,820
stretching it by a factor of 3, and the y coordinate as a scalar that scales j-hat,

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,240
flipping it and stretching it by a factor of 2.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,340
In this sense, the vector that these coordinates describe is the sum of two scaled vectors.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,560
That's a surprisingly important concept, this idea of adding together two scaled vectors.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,440
Those two vectors, i-hat and j-hat, have a special name, by the way.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,560
Together, they're called the basis of a coordinate system.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,820
What this means, basically, is that when you think about coordinates as scalars,

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,660
the basis vectors are what those scalars actually, you know, scale.

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,660
There's also a more technical definition, but I'll get to that later.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,300
By framing our coordinate system in terms of these two special basis vectors,

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
it raises a pretty interesting and subtle point.

27
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,520
We could have chosen different basis vectors and gotten a completely reasonable new coordinate system.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,760
For example, take some vector pointing up and to the right,

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,960
along with some other vector pointing down and to the right in some way.

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,400
Take a moment to think about all the different vectors that you can get by choosing two scalars,

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,200
using each one to scale one of the vectors, then adding together what you get.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,500
Which two-dimensional vectors can you reach by altering the choices of scalars?

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,000
The answer is that you can reach every possible two-dimensional vector,

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,660
and I think it's a good puzzle to contemplate why.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,700
A new pair of basis vectors like this still gives us a valid way to go back and forth

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,360
between pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors,

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,940
but the association is definitely different from the one that you get

38
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,880
using the more standard basis of i-hat and j-hat.

39
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,900
This is something I'll go into much more detail on later,

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,540
describing the exact relationship between different coordinate systems,

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,100
but for right now, I just want you to appreciate the fact

42
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,660
that any time we describe vectors numerically,

43
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,380
it depends on an implicit choice of what basis vectors we're using.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,460
So any time that you're scaling two vectors and adding them like this,

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,720
it's called a linear combination of those two vectors.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
Where does this word linear come from? Why does this have anything to do with lines?

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,840
Well, this isn't the etymology, but one way I like to think about it

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,940
is that if you fix one of those scalars and let the other one change its value freely,

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,620
the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line.

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,200
Now, if you let both scalars range freely

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,880
and consider every possible vector that you can get,

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,480
there are two things that can happen.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
For most pairs of vectors,

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,120
you'll be able to reach every possible point in the plane.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,940
Every two-dimensional vector is within your grasp.

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,260
However, in the unlucky case where your two original vectors happen to line up,

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,360
the tip of the resulting vector is limited to just this single line passing through the origin.

58
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,120
Actually, technically there's a third possibility too.

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,160
Both your vectors could be zero, in which case you'd just be stuck at the origin.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,380
Here's some more terminology.

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,300
The set of all possible vectors that you can reach

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,040
with a linear combination of a given pair of vectors

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,940
is called the span of those two vectors.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,740
So restating what we just saw in this lingo,

65
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,840
the span of most pairs of 2D vectors is all vectors of 2D space,

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,780
but when they line up, their span is all vectors whose tip sit on a certain line.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,740
Remember how I said that linear algebra revolves around

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,400
vector addition and scalar multiplication?

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,460
Well, the span of two vectors is basically a way of asking

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,400
what are all the possible vectors you can reach using only these two fundamental operations,

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,420
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,220
This is a good time to talk about how people commonly think about vectors as points.

73
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,900
It gets really crowded to think about a whole collection of vectors sitting on a line,

74
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,520
and more crowded still to think about all two-dimensional vectors all at once,

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
filling up the plane.

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,660
So when dealing with collections of vectors like this,

77
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,300
it's common to represent each one with just a point in space,

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,480
the point at the tip of that vector where, as usual,

79
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,680
I want you thinking about that vector with its tail on the origin.

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,180
That way, if you want to think about every possible vector whose tip sits on a certain line,

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,340
just think about the line itself.

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,780
Likewise, to think about all possible two-dimensional vectors all at once,

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,360
conceptualize each one as the point where its tip sits.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,720
So in effect, what you'll be thinking about is the infinite flat sheet of two-dimensional space itself,

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,380
leaving the arrows out of it.

86
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,740
In general, if you're thinking about a vector on its own, think of it as an arrow.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,420
And if you're dealing with a collection of vectors, it's convenient to think of them all as points.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,360
So for our span example, the span of most pairs of vectors

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,920
ends up being the entire infinite sheet of two-dimensional space.

90
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,880
But if they line up, their span is just a line.

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,360
The idea of span gets a lot more interesting if we start thinking about vectors in three-dimensional space.

92
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,700
For example, if you take two vectors in 3D space that are not pointing in the same direction,

93
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,780
what does it mean to take their span?

94
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,640
Well, their span is the collection of all possible linear combinations of those two vectors,

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,620
meaning all possible vectors you get by scaling each of the two of them in some way

96
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,020
and then adding them together.

97
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,980
You can kind of imagine turning two different knobs to change the two scalars

98
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,020
defining the linear combination, adding the scaled vectors

99
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,160
and following the tip of the resulting vector.

100
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,600
That tip will trace out some kind of flat sheet

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,120
cutting through the origin of three-dimensional space.

102
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,560
This flat sheet is the span of the two vectors.

103
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,540
Or more precisely, the set of all possible vectors whose tips sit on that flat sheet

104
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,240
is the span of your two vectors.

105
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,360
Isn't that a beautiful mental image?

106
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,360
So, what happens if we add a third vector and consider the span of all three of those guys?

107
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,980
A linear combination of three vectors is defined pretty much the same way as it is for two.

108
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,840
You'll choose three different scalars, scale each of those vectors, and then add them all together.

109
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,960
And again, the span of these vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations.

110
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,960
Two different things could happen here.

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,940
If your third vector happens to be sitting on the span of the first two,

112
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,540
then the span doesn't change.

113
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,940
You're sort of trapped on that same flat sheet.

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,420
In other words, adding a scaled version of that third vector to the linear combination

115
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,120
doesn't really give you access to any new vectors.

116
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,740
But if you just randomly choose a third vector,

117
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,060
it's almost certainly not sitting on the span of those first two.

118
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,720
Then, since it's pointing in a separate direction,

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,320
it unlocks access to every possible three-dimensional vector.

120
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,320
One way I like to think about this is that as you scale that new third vector,

121
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,480
it moves around that span sheet of the first two, sweeping it through all of space.

122
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,820
Another way to think about it is that you're making full use of the three freely changing

123
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,140
scalars that you have at your disposal to access the full three dimensions of space.

124
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,060
Now, in the case where the third vector was already sitting on the span of the first two,

125
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,320
or the case where two vectors happen to line up,

126
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,860
we want some terminology to describe the fact that at least one of these vectors is redundant,

127
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,720
not adding anything to our span.

128
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,120
Whenever this happens, where you have multiple vectors

129
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
and you could remove one without reducing the span,

130
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,420
the relevant terminology is to say that they are linearly dependent.

131
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,240
Another way of phrasing that would be to say that one of the vectors

132
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,100
can be expressed as a linear combination of the others,

133
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,680
since it's already in the span of the others.

134
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,940
On the other hand, if each vector really does add another dimension to the span,

135
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,620
they're said to be linearly independent.

136
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,280
So with all of that terminology, and hopefully with some good mental images to go with it,

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,280
let me leave you with a puzzle before we go.

138
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,400
The technical definition of a basis of a space

139
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,180
is a set of linearly independent vectors that span that space.

140
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,100
Now, given how I described a basis earlier,

141
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,380
and given your current understanding of the words span and linearly independent,

142
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,700
think about why this definition would make sense.

143
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,240
In the next video, I'll get into matrices in transforming space.

144
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,120
See you then!
