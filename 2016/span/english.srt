1
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,180
In the last video, along with the ideas of vector addition and scalar multiplication,

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,960
I described vector coordinates, where there's this back and forth between, for example,

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,520
Now, I imagine the vector coordinates were already familiar to a lot of you,

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,520
but there's another kind of interesting way to think about these coordinates,

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,960
which is pretty central to linear algebra.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,640
When you have a pair of numbers that's meant to describe a vector, like 3, negative 2,

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,860
I want you to think about each coordinate as a scalar,

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,240
meaning think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,000
In the xy coordinate system, there are two very special vectors,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,600
the one pointing to the right with length 1, commonly called i-hat,

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,320
or the unit vector in the x direction,

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,120
and the one pointing straight up with length 1, commonly called j-hat,

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,720
or the unit vector in the y direction.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,240
Now, think of the x coordinate of our vector as a scalar that scales i-hat,

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,120
stretching it by a factor of 3,

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,360
and the y coordinate as a scalar that scales j-hat,

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,000
flipping it and stretching it by a factor of 2.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,160
In this sense, the vector that these coordinates describe is the sum of two scaled vectors.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,480
That's a surprisingly important concept, this idea of adding together two scaled vectors.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,840
Those two vectors, i-hat and j-hat, have a special name, by the way.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,340
Together, they're called the basis of a coordinate system.

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,200
What this means, basically, is that when you think about coordinates as scalars,

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,520
the basis vectors are what those scalars actually, you know, scale.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,680
There's also a more technical definition, but I'll get to that later.

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,840
By framing our coordinate system in terms of these two special basis vectors,

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,520
it raises a pretty interesting and subtle point.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,160
We could have chosen different basis vectors and gotten a completely reasonable new coordinate system.

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,140
For example, take some vector pointing up and to the right,

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,720
along with some other vector pointing down and to the right in some way.

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,040
Take a moment to think about all the different vectors that you can get by choosing two scalars,

32
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,040
using each one to scale one of the vectors, then adding together what you get.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,800
Which two dimensional vectors can you reach by altering the choices of scalars?

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
The answer is that you can reach every possible two dimensional vector,

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,360
and I think it's a good puzzle to contemplate why.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,720
A new pair of basis vectors like this still gives us a valid way to go back and forth

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
between pairs of numbers and two dimensional vectors,

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,940
but the association is definitely different from the one that you get

39
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,720
using the more standard basis of i-hat and j-hat.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,520
This is something I'll go into much more detail on later,

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,040
describing the exact relationship between different coordinate systems,

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,960
but for right now, I just want you to appreciate the fact that any time we describe vectors

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,540
numerically, it depends on an implicit choice of what basis vectors we're using.

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,900
So any time that you're scaling two vectors and adding them like this,

45
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,540
it's called a linear combination of those two vectors.

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,900
Where does this word linear come from?

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,700
Why does this have anything to do with lines?

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,020
Well, this isn't the etymology, but one way I like to think about it

49
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,500
is that if you fix one of those scalars and let the other one change its value freely,

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,220
the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line.

51
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,580
Now if you let both scalars range freely and consider every possible vector that you can

52
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,540
get, there are two things that can happen.

53
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,880
For most pairs of vectors, you'll be able to reach every possible point in the plane.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,340
Every two-dimensional vector is within your grasp.

55
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,740
However, in the unlucky case where your two original vectors happen to line up,

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,940
the tip of the resulting vector is limited to just this single line passing through the

57
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
origin.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,600
Actually, technically, there's a third possibility too.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,540
Both your vectors could be zero, in which case you'd just be stuck at the origin.

60
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,020
Here's some more terminology.

61
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,220
The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination of a given

62
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,660
pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors.

63
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,540
So restating what we just saw in this lingo, the span of most pairs of 2D vectors is all

64
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,980
vectors of 2D space, but when they line up, their span is all vectors whose tip sit on

65
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,180
a certain line.

66
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,820
Remember how I said that linear algebra revolves around vector addition and scalar multiplication?

67
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,780
Well, the span of two vectors is basically a way of asking what are all the possible

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,460
vectors you can reach using only these two fundamental operations, vector addition and

69
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,680
scalar multiplication.

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,940
This is a good time to talk about how people commonly think about vectors as points.

71
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,380
It gets really crowded to think about a whole collection of vectors sitting on a line, and

72
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,300
more crowded still to think about all two-dimensional vectors all at once, filling up the plane.

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,140
So when dealing with collections of vectors like this, it's common to represent each

74
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,740
one with just a point in space, the point at the tip of that vector where, as usual,

75
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,740
I want you thinking about that vector with its tail on the origin.

76
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,700
That way, if you want to think about every possible vector whose tip sits on a certain

77
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,940
line, just think about the line itself.

78
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,580
Likewise, to think about all possible two-dimensional vectors all at once, conceptualize each one

79
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,780
as the point where its tip sits.

80
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,920
So in effect, what you'll be thinking about is the infinite flat sheet of two-dimensional

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,220
space itself, leaving the arrows out of it.

82
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,540
In general, if you're thinking about a vector on its own, think of it as an arrow.

83
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,600
And if you're dealing with a collection of vectors, it's convenient to think of them

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,300
all as points.

85
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,060
So for our span example, the span of most pairs of vectors ends up being the entire

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,360
infinite sheet of two-dimensional space.

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,660
But if they line up, their span is just a line.

88
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,880
The idea of span gets a lot more interesting if we start thinking about vectors in three-dimensional

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
space.

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,440
For example, if you take two vectors in 3D space that are not pointing in the same direction,

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,120
what does it mean to take their span?

92
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,500
Well, their span is the collection of all possible linear combinations of those two

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,100
vectors, meaning all possible vectors you get by scaling each of the two of them in

94
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,040
some way and then adding them together.

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,660
You can kind of imagine turning two different knobs to change the two scalars defining the

96
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,180
linear combination, adding the scaled vectors and following the tip of the resulting vector.

97
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,660
That tip will trace out some kind of flat sheet cutting through the origin of three-dimensional

98
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,060
space.

99
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,380
This flat sheet is the span of the two vectors, or more precisely, the set of all possible

100
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,940
vectors whose tips sit on that flat sheet is the span of your two vectors.

101
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,940
Isn't that a beautiful mental image?

102
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,680
So what happens if we add a third vector and consider the span of all three of those guys?

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,460
A linear combination of three vectors is defined pretty much the same way as it is for two.

104
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,860
You'll choose three different scalars, scale each of those vectors, and then add them all

105
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,460
together.

106
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:23,540
And again, the span of these vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations.

107
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,460
Two different things could happen here.

108
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,900
If your third vector happens to be sitting on the span of the first two, then the span

109
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
doesn't change.

110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,540
You're sort of trapped on that same flat sheet.

111
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,860
In other words, adding a scaled version of that third vector to the linear combination

112
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,880
doesn't really give you access to any new vectors.

113
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,200
But if you just randomly choose a third vector, it's almost certainly not sitting on the span

114
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,520
of those first two.

115
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,280
Then, since it's pointing in a separate direction, it unlocks access to every possible three-dimensional

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,600
vector.

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,160
One way I like to think about this is that as you scale that new third vector, it moves

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,120
around that span sheet of the first two, sweeping it through all of space.

119
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,800
Another way to think about it is that you're making full use of the three freely changing

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,800
scalars that you have at your disposal to access the full three dimensions of space.

121
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,280
Now, in the case where the third vector was already sitting on the span of the first two,

122
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
or the case where two vectors happen to line up, we want some terminology to describe the

123
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,920
fact that at least one of these vectors is redundant, not adding anything to our span.

124
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,820
Whenever this happens, where you have multiple vectors and you could remove one without reducing

125
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,660
the span, the relevant terminology is to say that they are linearly dependent.

126
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,360
Another way of phrasing that would be to say that one of the vectors can be expressed as

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:53,040
a linear combination of the others, since it's already in the span of the others.

128
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,540
On the other hand, if each vector really does add another dimension to the span, they're

129
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,660
said to be linearly independent.

130
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,620
So, with all of that terminology, and hopefully with some good mental images to go with it,

131
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,900
let me leave you with a puzzle before we go.

132
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:18,860
The technical definition of a basis of a space is a set of linearly independent vectors that

133
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,100
span that space.

134
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,260
Now, given how I described a basis earlier, and given your current understanding of the

135
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:34,260
words span and linearly independent, think about why this definition would make sense.

136
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,740
In the next video, I'll get into matrices in transforming space.

137
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
See you then!
