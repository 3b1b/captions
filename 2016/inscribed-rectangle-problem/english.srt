1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
I've got several fun things for you this video.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,640
An unsolved problem, a very elegant solution to a weaker version of the problem, and a

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,520
little bit about what topology is and why people care.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,440
But before I jump into it, it's worth saying a few words on why I'm excited to share

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,000
this solution.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,560
When I was a kid, since I loved math and sought out various mathy things, I would occasionally

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,520
find myself in some talk or a seminar where people wanted to get the youth excited about

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,240
things that mathematicians care about.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,220
A very common go-to topic to excite our imaginations was topology.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,060
We might be shown something like a mobius strip, maybe building it out of construction

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,480
paper by twisting a rectangle and gluing its ends.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,280
Look, we'd be told, as we were asked to draw a line along the surface.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,880
It's a surface with just one side.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,220
Or we might be told that topologists view coffee mugs and donuts as the same thing,

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,700
since each has just one hole.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,140
But these kinds of demos always left a lurking question.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,340
How is this math?

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,860
How does any of this actually help to solve problems?

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,020
It wasn't until I saw the problem that I'm about to show you, with its elegant and surprising

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,680
solution, that I started to understand why mathematicians actually care about some of

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,300
these shapes and the properties they have.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,480
So there's this unsolved problem called the inscribed square problem.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,560
If you have a closed loop, meaning you squiggle some line through space in a potentially crazy

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,120
way and you end up back where you started, the question is whether or not you'll always

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,680
be able to find four points on this loop that make up a square.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,480
If your closed loop was a circle, for example, it's quite easy to find an inscribed square.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,440
Infinitely many, in fact.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,420
If your loop was instead an ellipse, it's still pretty easy to find an inscribed square.

29
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,580
The question is whether or not every possible closed loop, no matter how crazy, has at least

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,940
one inscribed square.

31
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
Pretty interesting, right?

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,960
I mean, just the fact that this is unsolved is interesting, that the current tools of

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,580
math can neither confirm nor deny that there's some loop with no inscribed square in it.

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,040
Now, if we weaken the question a bit and ask about inscribed rectangles instead of inscribed

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,740
squares, it's still pretty hard, but there is a beautiful video-worthy solution that

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,360
might actually be my favorite piece of math.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,220
The idea is to shift the focus away from individual points on the loop, and instead onto pairs

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
of points.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,300
We'll use the following fact about rectangles.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,840
Let's label the vertices of some rectangle ABCD.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,420
Then the pair of points AC has a few things in common with the pair of points BD.

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,600
The distance between A and C equals the distance between B and D, and the midpoint of A and

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,440
C is the same as the midpoint of B and D.

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,240
In fact, any time you have two separate pairs of points in space, AC and BD, if you can

45
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,440
guarantee that they share a midpoint and that the distance between AC equals the distance

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,640
between B and D, it's enough to guarantee that those four points make up a rectangle.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,100
So what we're going to do is try to prove that for any closed loop, it's always possible

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,660
to find two distinct pairs of points on that loop that share a midpoint and which are the

49
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,900
same distance apart.

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,760
Take a moment to make sure that's clear.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,300
We're finding two distinct pairs of points that share a common midpoint and which are

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,440
the same distance apart.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,100
The way we'll go about this is to define a function that takes in pairs of points on

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,800
the loop and outputs a single point in 3D space which kind of encodes the midpoint and

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
distance information.

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,060
It will be sort of like a graph.

57
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,440
Consider the closed loop to be sitting on the xy-plane in 3D space.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,240
For a given pair of points, label their midpoint M, which will be some point on the xy-plane,

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,680
and label the distance between them D.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,300
Draw out the point which is exactly D units above that midpoint M in the z-direction.

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,900
As you do this for many possible pairs of points, you'll effectively be drawing through

62
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,500
3D space.

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,700
And if you do it for all possible pairs of points on the loop, you'll draw out some kind

64
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,780
of surface above the plane.

65
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,180
Now look at the surface and notice how it seems to hug the loop itself.

66
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,720
This is actually going to be important later, so let's think about why it happens.

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,760
As the pair of points on the loop gets closer and closer, the plotted point gets lower since

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,800
its height is by definition equal to the distance between the points.

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,280
Also, the midpoint gets closer and closer to the loop as the points approach each other.

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Once the pair of points coincides, meaning the input of our function looks like xx for

71
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,260
some point x on the loop, the plotted point of the surface will be exactly on the loop

72
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
at the point x.

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,520
OK, so remember that.

74
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,900
Another important fact is that this function is continuous, and all that really means is

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,600
that if you slightly adjust a given pair of points, then the corresponding output in 3D

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,340
space is only slightly adjusted as well.

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,620
There's never a sudden discontinuous jump.

78
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,640
Our goal, then, is to show that this function has a collision, that two distinct pairs of

79
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,000
points each map to the same spot in 3D space.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Because the only way for that to happen is if they share a common midpoint, and if their

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,300
distance d apart from each other is the same.

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,560
So in some sense, finding an inscribed rectangle comes down to showing that this surface has

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,960
to intersect itself.

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,060
To move forward from here, we need to build up a relationship with the idea of pairs of

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,820
points on a loop.

86
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,180
Think about how we represent pairs of real numbers using a two-dimensional coordinate

87
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,180
plane.

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,940
Analogous to this, we're going to seek out a certain 2D surface which naturally represents

89
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,940
all pairs of points on the loop.

90
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,500
Understanding the properties of this surface will help to show why the graph we just defined

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,140
has to intersect itself.

92
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,540
Now when I say pair of points, there are two things I could be talking about.

93
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,140
The first is ordered pairs of points, which would mean a pair like AB would be considered

94
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:39,580
distinct from the pair BA, that is, there's some notion of which point is the first one.

95
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,460
The second idea is unordered points, where AB and BA would be considered the same thing,

96
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,360
where all that really matters is what the points are, and there's no meaning to which

97
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,940
one is first.

98
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,260
Ultimately, we want to understand unordered pairs of points, but to get there, we need

99
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,740
to take a path of thought through ordered pairs.

100
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,920
We'll start out by straightening out the loop, cutting it at some point, and deforming

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,780
it into an interval.

102
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,900
For the sake of having some labels, let's say that this is the interval on the number

103
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,660
line from 0 to 1.

104
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,600
By following where each point ends up, every point on the loop corresponds with a unique

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,060
number on this interval.

106
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Except for the point where the cut happened, which corresponds simultaneously to both endpoints

107
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,360
of the interval, meaning the numbers 0 and 1.

108
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,040
The benefit of straightening out this loop like this is that we can start thinking about

109
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,120
pairs of points the same way we think about pairs of numbers.

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,860
Make a y-axis using a second interval, then associate each pair of values on the interval

111
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,040
with a single point in this 1x1 square they span out.

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,420
Every individual point of this square naturally corresponds to a pair of points on the loop,

113
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,080
since its x and y coordinates are each numbers between 0 and 1, which are in turn associated

114
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,940
to some unique point on the loop.

115
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,000
Remember, we're trying to find a surface that naturally represents the set of all pairs

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,760
of points on the loop, and this square is the first step to doing that.

117
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,340
The problem is that there's some ambiguity when it comes to the edges of the square.

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,980
Remember, the endpoints 0 and 1 on the interval really correspond to the same point of the

119
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,880
loop, as if to say that those endpoints need to be glued together if we're going to faithfully

120
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,300
map back to the loop.

121
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,980
So all of the points on the left edge of the square, like 0, 0.1, 0, 0.2, on and on and

122
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,880
on, really represent the same pair of points on the loop as the corresponding coordinates

123
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,180
on the right edge of the square, 1, 0.1, 1, 0.2, on and on and on.

124
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,540
So for this square to represent the pairs of points on the loop in a unique way, we

125
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,620
need to glue this left edge to the right edge.

126
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,140
I'll mark each edge with some arrows to remember how the edges need to be lined up.

127
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,580
Likewise, the bottom edge needs to be glued to the top edge, since y coordinates of 0

128
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:14,260
and 1 really represent the same second point in a given pair of points on the loop.

129
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,860
If you bend this square to perform the gluing, first rolling it into a cylinder to glue the

130
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,340
left and right edges, then gluing the ends of that cylinder, which represent the top

131
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,620
and bottom edges, we get a torus, better known as the surface of a doughnut.

132
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,020
Every individual point on this torus corresponds to a unique pair of points on the loop, and

133
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,620
likewise every pair of points on the loop corresponds to some unique point on this torus.

134
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,460
The torus is to pair of points on the loop what the xy-plane is to pairs of points on

135
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,180
the real number line.

136
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,020
The key property of this association is that it's continuous both ways, meaning if you

137
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,860
nudge any point on the torus by just a tiny amount, it corresponds to only a very slight

138
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,240
nudge to the pair of points on the loop, and vice versa.

139
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,700
So if the torus is the natural shape for ordered pairs of points on the loop, what's the

140
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,460
natural shape for unordered pairs?

141
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,860
After all, the whole reason we're doing this is to show that two distinct pairs of

142
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,340
points on the loop share a midpoint and are the same distance apart.

143
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:28,260
But if we consider a pair AB to be distinct from BA, then that would trivially give us

144
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,500
two separate pairs which have the same midpoint and distance apart.

145
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,300
That's like saying you can always find a rectangle so long as you consider any pair

146
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,440
of points to be a rectangle.

147
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
Not helpful.

148
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
So let's think about this.

149
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,960
Let's think about how to represent unordered pairs of points looking back at our unit square.

150
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:55,320
We need to say that the coordinates 0.2, 0.3 represent the same pair as 0.3, 0.2, or that

151
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,680
0.5, 0.7 really represents the same thing as 0.7, 0.5.

152
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:11,760
And in general, any coordinates x,y has to represent the same thing as y,x.

153
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,860
Once again, we capture this idea by gluing points together when they're supposed to

154
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,800
represent the same pair, which in this case requires folding the square over diagonally.

155
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,360
Now notice this diagonal line, the crease of the fold.

156
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,000
It represents all pairs of points that look like xx, meaning the pairs which are really

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,940
just a single point written twice.

158
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,100
Right now, it's marked with a red line.

159
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
And you should remember it.

160
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,340
It will become important to know where all of these pairs like xx live.

161
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,680
But we still have some arrows to glue together here.

162
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
We need to glue that bottom edge to the right edge.

163
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,640
And the orientation with which we do this is going to be important.

164
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,120
Points towards the left of the bottom edge have to be glued to points towards the bottom

165
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,720
of the right edge, and points towards the right of the bottom edge have to be glued

166
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,600
to points towards the top of the right edge.

167
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,780
It's weird to think about, right?

168
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Go ahead, pause and ponder this for a moment.

169
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,780
The trick, which is kind of clever, is to make a diagonal cut, which we need to remember

170
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,840
to glue back in just a moment.

171
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,080
After that, we can glue the bottom and the right like so.

172
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,800
But notice the orientation of the arrows here.

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
To glue back what we just cut, we don't simply connect the edges of this rectangle

174
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,340
to get a cylinder.

175
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,520
We have to make a twist.

176
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,800
Doing this in 3D space, the shape we get is a Möbius strip.

177
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Isn't that awesome?

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,920
Evidently the surface which represents all pairs of unordered points on the loop is the

179
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,840
Möbius strip.

180
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,420
And notice the edge of this strip, shown here in red, represents the pairs of points that

181
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:56,660
look like xx, those which are really just a single point listed twice.

182
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,980
The Möbius strip is to unordered pairs of points on the loop what the xy plane is to

183
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,100
pairs of real numbers.

184
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,380
That totally blew my mind when I first saw it.

185
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,140
With this fact that there is a continuous one-to-one association between unordered pairs

186
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,960
of points on the loop and individual points on this Möbius strip, we can solve the inscribed

187
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,940
rectangle problem.

188
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,660
Remember, we had defined this special kind of graph in 3D space, where the loop was sitting

189
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
in the xy plane.

190
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,580
For each pair of points, you consider their midpoint M, which lives on the xy plane, and

191
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:41,460
their distance d apart, and you plot a point which is exactly d units above M.

192
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,540
Because of the continuous one-to-one association between pairs of points on the loop and the

193
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,980
Möbius strip, this gives us a natural map from the Möbius strip onto this surface in

194
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,980
3D space.

195
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,700
For every point on the Möbius strip, consider the pair of points on the loop that it represents,

196
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:06,620
then plug that pair of points into the special function.

197
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,920
And here's the key point.

198
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,980
When pairs of points on the loop are extremely close together, the output of the function

199
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,300
is right above the loop itself, and in the extreme case of pairs of points like xx, the

200
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,940
output of the function is exactly on the loop.

201
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,380
Since points on this red edge of the Möbius strip correspond to pairs like xx, when the

202
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,860
Möbius strip is mapped onto this surface, it must be done in such a way that the edge

203
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,300
of the strip gets mapped right onto that loop in the xy plane.

204
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,500
But if you stand back and think about it for a moment, considering the strange shape of

205
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,060
the Möbius strip, there is no way to glue its edge to something two-dimensional without

206
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,260
forcing the strip to intersect itself.

207
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,580
Since points of the Möbius strip represent pairs of points on the loop, if the strip

208
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:07,500
intersects itself during this mapping, it means that there are at least two distinct

209
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,860
pairs of points that correspond to the same output on this surface, which means they share

210
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,380
a midpoint and are the same distance apart, which in turn means that they form a rectangle.

211
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,780
And that's the proof!

212
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,140
Or at least, if you're willing to trust me in saying that you can't glue the edge of

213
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,340
a Möbius strip to a plane without forcing it to intersect itself, then that's the

214
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,500
proof.

215
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,380
This fact is intuitively clear looking at the Möbius strip, but in order to make it

216
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,100
rigorous you basically need to start developing the field of topology.

217
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,680
In fact, for any of you who have a topology class in your future, going through the exercise

218
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,340
of trying to justify this is a good way to gain an appreciation for why topologists choose

219
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,980
to make certain definitions.

220
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,120
And I want you to take note of something here.

221
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,420
The reason for talking about the torus and the Möbius strip was not because we were

222
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,620
playing around with construction paper, or because we were daydreaming about deforming

223
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,560
a coffee mug.

224
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,260
They came up as a natural way to understand pairs of points on a loop, and that's something

225
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,420
that we needed to solve a concrete problem.
