00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,620
I've got several fun things for you this video.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,359
An unsolved problem, a very elegant solution to a weaker version of the problem, 

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,500
and a little bit about what topology is and why people care.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,622
But before I jump into it, it's worth saying a 

5
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:20,060
few words on why I'm excited to share this solution.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,793
When I was a kid, since I loved math and sought out various mathy things, 

7
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:28,561
I would occasionally find myself in some talk or a seminar where people 

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:32,540
wanted to get the youth excited about things that mathematicians care about.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,460
A very common go-to topic to excite our imaginations was topology.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,662
We might be shown something like a mobius strip, 

11
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:45,120
maybe building it out of construction paper by twisting a rectangle and gluing its ends.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,120
Look, we'd be told, as we were asked to draw a line along the surface.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,700
It's a surface with just one side.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,043
Or we might be told that topologists view coffee mugs and donuts as the same thing, 

15
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:58,640
since each has just one hole.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,360
But these kinds of demos always left a lurking question.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,980
How is this math?

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,660
How does any of this actually help to solve problems?

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,739
It wasn't until I saw the problem that I'm about to show you, 

20
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,367
with its elegant and surprising solution, that I started to understand why 

21
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:18,480
mathematicians actually care about some of these shapes and the properties they have.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,720
So, there's this unsolved problem called the inscribed square problem.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,926
If you have a closed loop, meaning you squiggle some line through space in a 

24
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:32,020
potentially crazy way and you end up back where you started, 

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,130
the question is whether or not you'll always be able to find four points on this 

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,500
loop that make up a square.

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,732
If your closed loop was a circle, for example, 

28
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:42,860
it's quite easy to find an inscribed square.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,560
Infinitely many, in fact.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,540
If your loop was instead an ellipse, it's still pretty easy to find an inscribed square.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,721
The question is whether or not every possible closed loop, 

32
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,780
no matter how crazy, has at least one inscribed square.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Pretty interesting, right?

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,633
I mean, just the fact that this is unsolved is interesting, 

35
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:11,609
that the current tools of math can neither confirm nor deny that there's some loop with 

36
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,080
no inscribed square in it.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,188
Now, if we weaken the question a bit and ask about inscribed rectangles 

38
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:22,930
instead of inscribed squares, it's still pretty hard, but there is a beautiful, 

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,140
video-worthy solution that might actually be my favorite piece of math.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,010
The idea is to shift the focus away from individual 

41
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,780
points on the loop and instead onto pairs of points.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,980
We'll use the following fact about rectangles.

43
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,320
Let's label the vertices of some rectangle ABCD.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,400
Then the pair of points AC has a few things in common with the pair of points BD.

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,429
The distance between A and C equals the distance between B and D, 

46
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:55,580
and the midpoint of A and C is the same as the midpoint of B and D.

47
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,327
In fact, any time you have two separate pairs of points in space, AC and BD, 

48
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:06,982
if you can guarantee that they share a midpoint and that the distance between AC equals 

49
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:12,508
the distance between B and D, it's enough to guarantee that those four points make up 

50
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,280
a rectangle.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,072
So what we're going to do is try to prove that for any closed loop, 

52
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,461
it's always possible to find two distinct pairs of points on that 

53
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,800
loop that share a midpoint and which are the same distance apart.

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,180
Take a moment to make sure that's clear.

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,594
We're finding two distinct pairs of points that share 

56
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:33,720
a common midpoint and which are the same distance apart.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,467
The way we'll go about this is to define a function that takes 

58
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:45,419
in pairs of points on the loop and outputs a single point in 3D space, 

59
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,760
which kind of encodes the midpoint and distance information.

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,660
It will be sort of like a graph.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,640
Consider the closed loop to be sitting on the xy-plane in 3D space.

62
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,492
For a given pair of points, label their midpoint m, 

63
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:05,280
which will be some point on the xy-plane, and label the distance between them d.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,780
Plot the point, which is exactly d units above that midpoint m in the z-direction.

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,771
As you do this for many possible pairs of points, 

66
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,640
you'll effectively be drawing through 3D space.

67
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,592
And if you do it for all possible pairs of points on the loop, 

68
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,380
you'll draw out some kind of surface above the plane.

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,360
Now look at the surface, and notice how it seems to hug the loop itself.

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,360
This is actually going to be important later, so let's think about why it happens.

71
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,177
As the pair of points on the loop gets closer and closer, the plotted point gets lower, 

72
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:47,300
since its height is by definition equal to the distance between the points.

73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,120
Also, the midpoint gets closer and closer to the loop as the points approach each other.

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,738
Once the pair of points coincides, meaning the input of our 

75
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:59,828
function looks like xx for some point x on the loop, 

76
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:04,260
the plotted point of the surface will be exactly on the loop at the point x.

77
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,680
Okay, so remember that.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,507
Another important fact is that this function is continuous, 

79
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:14,944
and all that really means is that if you slightly adjust a given pair of points, 

80
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,780
then the corresponding output in 3D is only slightly adjusted as well.

81
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,340
There's never a sudden discontinuous jump.

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,414
Our goal, then, is to show that this function has a collision, 

83
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:30,820
that two distinct pairs of points each map to the same spot in 3D space.

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,592
Because the only way for that to happen is if they share a common midpoint, 

85
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:38,700
and if their distance d apart from each other is the same.

86
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,509
So in some sense, finding an inscribed rectangle comes 

87
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,020
down to showing that this surface has to intersect itself.

88
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,087
To move forward from here, we need to build up a 

89
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,000
relationship with the idea of pairs of points on a loop.

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,473
Think about how we represent pairs of real numbers 

91
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,720
using a two-dimensional coordinate plane.

92
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,430
Analogous to this, we're going to seek out a certain 2D surface 

93
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,520
which naturally represents all pairs of points on the loop.

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,892
Understanding the properties of this surface will help to show 

95
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:22,200
why the graph that we just defined has to intersect itself.

96
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,860
Now, when I say pair of points, there are two things that I could be talking about.

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,575
The first is ordered pairs of points, which would mean a 

98
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,780
pair like AB would be considered distinct from the pair BA.

99
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,380
That is, there's some notion of which point is the first one.

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,355
The second idea is unordered points, where AB and BA would be considered the same thing, 

101
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:47,532
where all that really matters is what the points are, 

102
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,180
and there's no meaning to which one is first.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,928
Ultimately, we want to understand unordered pairs of points, 

104
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:57,480
but to get there, we need to take a path of thought through ordered pairs.

105
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,885
We'll start out by straightening out the loop, 

106
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:04,880
cutting it at some point, and deforming it into an interval.

107
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,975
For the sake of having some labels, let's say that 

108
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:10,560
this is the interval on the number line from 0 to 1.

109
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,803
By following where each point ends up, every point on the loop corresponds with a 

110
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:21,671
unique number on this interval, except for the point where the cut happened, 

111
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:25,969
which corresponds simultaneously to both endpoints of the interval, 

112
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,740
meaning the numbers 0 and 1.

113
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,537
Now, the benefit of straightening out this loop like this is that we can start 

114
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:35,980
thinking about pairs of points the same way we think about pairs of numbers.

115
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,570
Make a y-axis using a second interval, then associate each pair of values 

116
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,580
on the interval with a single point in this 1x1 square that they span out.

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,026
Every individual point of this square naturally corresponds to a pair of 

118
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:58,982
points on the loop, since its x and y coordinates are each numbers between 0 and 1, 

119
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:02,640
which are in turn associated to some unique point on the loop.

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,493
Remember, we're trying to find a surface that naturally represents the set of 

121
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:11,620
all pairs of points on the loop, and this square is the first step to doing that.

122
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,560
The problem is that there's some ambiguity when it comes to the edges of the square.

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,486
Remember, the endpoints 0 and 1 on the interval really correspond to 

124
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:25,348
the same point of the loop, as if to say that those endpoints need to 

125
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:29,100
be glued together if we're going to faithfully map back to the loop.

126
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,012
So all of the points on the left edge of the square, like 0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.2, 

127
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:40,191
on and on and on, really represent the same pair of points on the loop as the 

128
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,171
corresponding coordinates on the right edge of the square, 1, 0.1, 1, 0.2, 

129
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,300
on and on and on.

130
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,568
So for this square to represent the pairs of points on the loop in a unique way, 

131
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,320
we need to glue this left edge to the right edge.

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll mark each edge with some arrows to remember how the edges need to be lined up.

133
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,065
Likewise, the bottom edge needs to be glued to the top edge, 

134
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:08,950
since y-coordinates of 0 and 1 really represent the same second point in a given pair 

135
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,200
of points on the loop.

136
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,476
If you bend this square to perform the gluing, 

137
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:20,263
first rolling it into a cylinder to glue the left and right edges, 

138
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:24,841
then gluing the ends of that cylinder, which represent the top and bottom edges, 

139
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:28,120
we get a torus, better known as the surface of a doughnut.

140
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,508
Every individual point on this torus corresponds to a unique pair of points on the loop, 

141
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:38,011
and likewise, every pair of points on the loop corresponds to 

142
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,820
some unique point on this torus.

143
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,455
The torus is to pair of points on the loop what the 

144
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:46,540
xy-plane is to pairs of points on the real number line.

145
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,766
The key property of this association is that it's continuous both ways, 

146
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:57,532
meaning if you nudge any point on the torus by just a tiny amount, 

147
00:09:57,532 --> 00:10:01,916
it corresponds to only a very slight nudge to the pair of points on the loop, 

148
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,760
and vice versa.

149
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,135
So if the torus is the natural shape for ordered pairs of points on the loop, 

150
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,440
what's the natural shape for unordered pairs?

151
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,270
After all, the whole reason we're doing this is to show that two distinct pairs 

152
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,340
of pairs of points on the loop share a midpoint and are the same distance apart.

153
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,268
But if we consider a pair AB to be distinct from BA, 

154
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:29,714
then that would trivially give us two separate pairs which have the same 

155
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,420
midpoint and distance apart.

156
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,864
That's like saying you can always find a rectangle so 

157
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:37,640
long as you consider any pair of points to be a rectangle.

158
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,840
Not helpful.

159
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
So let's think about this.

160
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,103
Let's think about how to represent unordered pairs 

161
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,100
of points looking back at our unit square.

162
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:54,040
We need to say that the coordinates 0.2, 0.3 represent the same pair as 0.3, 0.2.

163
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,720
Or that 0.5, 0.7 really represents the same thing as 0.7, 0.5.

164
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,320
And in general, any coordinates x, y has to represent the same thing as y, x.

165
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,271
Once again, we capture this idea by gluing points together when they're supposed to 

166
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:21,500
represent the same pair, which in this case requires folding the square over diagonally.

167
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,500
Now notice this diagonal line, the crease of the fold.

168
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,138
It represents all pairs of points that look like xx, 

169
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:33,860
meaning the pairs which are really just a single point written twice.

170
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
Right now, it's marked with a red line.

171
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,000
And you should remember it.

172
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,160
It will become important to know where all of these pairs like xx live.

173
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,420
But we still have some arrows to glue together here.

174
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,960
We need to glue that bottom edge to the right edge.

175
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,800
And the orientation with which we do this is going to be important.

176
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,680
Points towards the left of the bottom edge have to be 

177
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,900
glued to points towards the bottom of the right edge.

178
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,489
And points towards the right of the bottom edge have 

179
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,740
to be glued to points towards the top of the right edge.

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
It's weird to think about, right?

181
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,540
Go ahead, pause and ponder this for a moment.

182
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,404
The trick, which is kind of clever, is to make a diagonal cut, 

183
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:15,040
which we need to remember to glue back in just a moment.

184
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,620
After that, we can glue the bottom and the right like so.

185
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,200
But notice the orientation of the arrows here.

186
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,029
To glue back what we just cut, we don't simply 

187
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,660
connect the edges of this rectangle to get a cylinder.

188
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,320
We have to make a twist.

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Doing this in 3D space, the shape we get is a Möbius strip.

190
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,420
Isn't that awesome?

191
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,865
Evidently, the surface which represents all pairs 

192
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:43,700
of unordered points on the loop is the Möbius strip.

193
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,578
And notice, the edge of this strip, shown here in red, 

194
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,522
represents the pairs of points that look like xx, 

195
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:53,820
those which are really just a single point listed twice.

196
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,320
The Möbius strip is to unordered pairs of points on 

197
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,220
the loop what the xy-plane is to pairs of real numbers.

198
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,020
That totally blew my mind when I first saw it.

199
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,793
Now, with this fact that there is a continuous one-to-one association 

200
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:18,211
between unordered pairs of points on the loop and individual points on this Möbius strip, 

201
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,920
we can solve the inscribed rectangle problem.

202
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,147
Remember, we had defined this special kind of graph in 3D space, 

203
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:28,640
where the loop was sitting in the xy-plane.

204
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,751
For each pair of points, you consider their midpoint m, which lives on the xy-plane, 

205
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,780
and their distance d apart, and you plot a point which is exactly d units above m.

206
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,915
Because of the continuous one-to-one association between pairs 

207
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,701
of points on the loop and the Möbius strip, this gives us a 

208
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:52,740
natural map from the Möbius strip onto this surface in 3D space.

209
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,037
For every point on the Möbius strip, consider the pair of points on the loop 

210
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,220
that it represents, then plug that pair of points into the special function.

211
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,440
And here's the key point.

212
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,215
When pairs of points on the loop are extremely close together, 

213
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,375
the output of the function is right above the loop itself, 

214
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,161
and in the extreme case of pairs of points like xx, 

215
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,840
the output of the function is exactly on the loop.

216
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,787
Since points on this red edge of the Möbius strip correspond to pairs like xx, 

217
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:29,994
when the Möbius strip is mapped onto this surface, 

218
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:35,025
it must be done in such a way that the edge of the strip gets mapped right onto 

219
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,660
that loop in the xy-plane.

220
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,284
But if you stand back and think about it for a moment, 

221
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:45,163
considering the strange shape of the Möbius strip, 

222
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:49,114
there is no way to glue its edge to something two-dimensional without 

223
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:51,260
forcing the strip to intersect itself.

224
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,556
Since points of the Möbius strip represent pairs of points on the loop, 

225
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:02,468
if the strip intersects itself during this mapping, 

226
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:09,238
it means that there are at least two distinct pairs of points that correspond to the same 

227
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:15,557
output on this surface, which means they share a midpoint and are the same distance 

228
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:19,620
apart, which in turn means that they form a rectangle.

229
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,980
And that's the proof!

230
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,483
Or at least, if you're willing to trust me in saying that you can't glue the edge of 

231
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:30,660
the Möbius strip to a plane without forcing it to intersect itself, then that's the proof.

232
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,175
This fact is intuitively clear looking at the Möbius strip, 

233
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:40,199
but in order to make it rigorous, you basically need to start developing the 

234
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,140
field of topology.

235
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,656
In fact, for any of you who have a topology class in your future, 

236
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:49,512
going through the exercise of trying to justify this is a good way to 

237
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:53,700
gain an appreciation for why topologists choose to make certain definitions.

238
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,580
And I want you to take note of something here.

239
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,870
The reason for talking about the torus and the Möbius strip 

240
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,209
was not because we were playing around with construction paper, 

241
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,340
or because we were daydreaming about deforming a coffee mug.

242
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,025
They came up as a natural way to understand pairs of points on a loop, 

243
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:14,420
and that's something that we needed to solve a concrete problem.

244
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,940
Thank you.
