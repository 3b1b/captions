1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,620
I've got several fun things for you this video.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,720
An unsolved problem, a very elegant solution to a weaker version of the problem, and a

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,500
little bit about what topology is and why people care.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,480
But before I jump into it, it's worth saying a few words on why I'm excited to share

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,060
this solution.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,520
When I was a kid, since I loved math and sought out various mathy things, I would occasionally

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,500
find myself in some talk or a seminar where people wanted to get the youth excited about

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,540
things that mathematicians care about.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,460
A very common go-to topic to excite our imaginations was topology.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,020
We might be shown something like a mobius strip, maybe building it out of construction

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,120
paper by twisting a rectangle and gluing its ends.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,120
Look, we'd be told, as we were asked to draw a line along the surface.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,700
It's a surface with just one side.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,900
Or we might be told that topologists view coffee mugs and donuts as the same thing,

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,640
since each has just one hole.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,360
But these kinds of demos always left a lurking question.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,980
How is this math?

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,660
How does any of this actually help to solve problems?

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,980
It wasn't until I saw the problem that I'm about to show you, with its elegant and surprising

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,660
solution, that I started to understand why mathematicians actually care about some of

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,480
these shapes and the properties they have.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,720
So, there's this unsolved problem called the inscribed square problem.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,540
If you have a closed loop, meaning you squiggle some line through space in a potentially crazy

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,120
way and you end up back where you started, the question is whether or not you'll always

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,500
be able to find four points on this loop that make up a square.

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,860
If your closed loop was a circle, for example, it's quite easy to find an inscribed square.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,560
Infinitely many, in fact.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,540
If your loop was instead an ellipse, it's still pretty easy to find an inscribed square.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,540
The question is whether or not every possible closed loop, no matter how crazy, has at least

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,780
one inscribed square.

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Pretty interesting, right?

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,040
I mean, just the fact that this is unsolved is interesting, that the current tools of

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,080
math can neither confirm nor deny that there's some loop with no inscribed square in it.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,060
Now, if we weaken the question a bit and ask about inscribed rectangles instead of inscribed

35
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,700
squares, it's still pretty hard, but there is a beautiful, video-worthy solution that

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,140
might actually be my favorite piece of math.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,160
The idea is to shift the focus away from individual points on the loop and instead onto pairs

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,780
of points.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,980
We'll use the following fact about rectangles.

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,320
Let's label the vertices of some rectangle ABCD.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,400
Then the pair of points AC has a few things in common with the pair of points BD.

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,700
The distance between A and C equals the distance between B and D, and the midpoint of A and

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,580
C is the same as the midpoint of B and D.

44
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,320
In fact, any time you have two separate pairs of points in space, AC and BD, if you can

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,440
guarantee that they share a midpoint and that the distance between AC equals the distance

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,280
between B and D, it's enough to guarantee that those four points make up a rectangle.

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,040
So what we're going to do is try to prove that for any closed loop, it's always possible

48
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,760
to find two distinct pairs of points on that loop that share a midpoint and which are the

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
same distance apart.

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,180
Take a moment to make sure that's clear.

51
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,340
We're finding two distinct pairs of points that share a common midpoint and which are

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,720
the same distance apart.

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,120
The way we'll go about this is to define a function that takes in pairs of points on

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,580
the loop and outputs a single point in 3D space, which kind of encodes the midpoint

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,760
and distance information.

56
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,660
It will be sort of like a graph.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,640
Consider the closed loop to be sitting on the xy-plane in 3D space.

58
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,540
For a given pair of points, label their midpoint m, which will be some point on the xy-plane,

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,280
and label the distance between them d.

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,780
Plot the point, which is exactly d units above that midpoint m in the z-direction.

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,720
As you do this for many possible pairs of points, you'll effectively be drawing through

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,640
3D space.

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,460
And if you do it for all possible pairs of points on the loop, you'll draw out some

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,380
kind of surface above the plane.

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,360
Now look at the surface, and notice how it seems to hug the loop itself.

66
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,360
This is actually going to be important later, so let's think about why it happens.

67
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,220
As the pair of points on the loop gets closer and closer, the plotted point gets lower,

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,300
since its height is by definition equal to the distance between the points.

69
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,120
Also, the midpoint gets closer and closer to the loop as the points approach each other.

70
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,940
Once the pair of points coincides, meaning the input of our function looks like xx for

71
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,120
some point x on the loop, the plotted point of the surface will be exactly on the loop

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,260
at the point x.

73
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,680
Okay, so remember that.

74
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,920
Another important fact is that this function is continuous, and all that really means is

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,340
that if you slightly adjust a given pair of points, then the corresponding output in 3D

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,780
is only slightly adjusted as well.

77
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,340
There's never a sudden discontinuous jump.

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,700
Our goal, then, is to show that this function has a collision, that two distinct pairs of

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,820
points each map to the same spot in 3D space.

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,480
Because the only way for that to happen is if they share a common midpoint, and if their

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,700
distance d apart from each other is the same.

82
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,580
So in some sense, finding an inscribed rectangle comes down to showing that this surface has

83
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,020
to intersect itself.

84
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,160
To move forward from here, we need to build up a relationship with the idea of pairs of

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
points on a loop.

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,840
Think about how we represent pairs of real numbers using a two-dimensional coordinate

87
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,720
plane.

88
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,900
Analogous to this, we're going to seek out a certain 2D surface which naturally represents

89
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,520
all pairs of points on the loop.

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,660
Understanding the properties of this surface will help to show why the graph that we just

91
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,200
defined has to intersect itself.

92
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,860
Now, when I say pair of points, there are two things that I could be talking about.

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,120
The first is ordered pairs of points, which would mean a pair like AB would be considered

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,780
distinct from the pair BA.

95
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,380
That is, there's some notion of which point is the first one.

96
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,960
The second idea is unordered points, where AB and BA would be considered the same thing,

97
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,400
where all that really matters is what the points are, and there's no meaning to which

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,180
one is first.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,280
Ultimately, we want to understand unordered pairs of points, but to get there, we need

100
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,480
to take a path of thought through ordered pairs.

101
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,860
We'll start out by straightening out the loop, cutting it at some point, and deforming

102
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,880
it into an interval.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,920
For the sake of having some labels, let's say that this is the interval on the number

104
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,560
line from 0 to 1.

105
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,520
By following where each point ends up, every point on the loop corresponds with a unique

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,960
number on this interval, except for the point where the cut happened, which corresponds

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,740
simultaneously to both endpoints of the interval, meaning the numbers 0 and 1.

108
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,780
Now, the benefit of straightening out this loop like this is that we can start thinking

109
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,980
about pairs of points the same way we think about pairs of numbers.

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,460
Make a y-axis using a second interval, then associate each pair of values on the interval

111
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,580
with a single point in this 1x1 square that they span out.

112
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,940
Every individual point of this square naturally corresponds to a pair of points on the loop,

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,000
since its x and y coordinates are each numbers between 0 and 1, which are in turn associated

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,640
to some unique point on the loop.

115
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,940
Remember, we're trying to find a surface that naturally represents the set of all pairs

116
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,620
of points on the loop, and this square is the first step to doing that.

117
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,560
The problem is that there's some ambiguity when it comes to the edges of the square.

118
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,100
Remember, the endpoints 0 and 1 on the interval really correspond to the same point of the

119
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,860
loop, as if to say that those endpoints need to be glued together if we're going to faithfully

120
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,100
map back to the loop.

121
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,860
So all of the points on the left edge of the square, like 0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.2, on and on

122
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,760
and on, really represent the same pair of points on the loop as the corresponding coordinates

123
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,300
on the right edge of the square, 1, 0.1, 1, 0.2, on and on and on.

124
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,560
So for this square to represent the pairs of points on the loop in a unique way, we

125
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,320
need to glue this left edge to the right edge.

126
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll mark each edge with some arrows to remember how the edges need to be lined up.

127
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,280
Likewise, the bottom edge needs to be glued to the top edge, since y-coordinates of 0

128
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,200
and 1 really represent the same second point in a given pair of points on the loop.

129
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,940
If you bend this square to perform the gluing, first rolling it into a cylinder to glue the

130
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,360
left and right edges, then gluing the ends of that cylinder, which represent the top

131
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,120
and bottom edges, we get a torus, better known as the surface of a doughnut.

132
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,040
Every individual point on this torus corresponds to a unique pair of points on the loop, and

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,820
likewise, every pair of points on the loop corresponds to some unique point on this torus.

134
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,500
The torus is to pair of points on the loop what the xy-plane is to pairs of points on

135
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,540
the real number line.

136
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,120
The key property of this association is that it's continuous both ways, meaning if you

137
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,900
nudge any point on the torus by just a tiny amount, it corresponds to only a very slight

138
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,760
nudge to the pair of points on the loop, and vice versa.

139
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,720
So if the torus is the natural shape for ordered pairs of points on the loop, what's the

140
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,440
natural shape for unordered pairs?

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,520
After all, the whole reason we're doing this is to show that two distinct pairs of

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,340
pairs of points on the loop share a midpoint and are the same distance apart.

143
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,300
But if we consider a pair AB to be distinct from BA, then that would trivially give us

144
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,420
two separate pairs which have the same midpoint and distance apart.

145
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,320
That's like saying you can always find a rectangle so long as you consider any pair

146
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,640
of points to be a rectangle.

147
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,840
Not helpful.

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
So let's think about this.

149
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,100
Let's think about how to represent unordered pairs of points looking back at our unit square.

150
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:54,040
We need to say that the coordinates 0.2, 0.3 represent the same pair as 0.3, 0.2.

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,720
Or that 0.5, 0.7 really represents the same thing as 0.7, 0.5.

152
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,320
And in general, any coordinates x, y has to represent the same thing as y, x.

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,960
Once again, we capture this idea by gluing points together when they're supposed to

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,500
represent the same pair, which in this case requires folding the square over diagonally.

155
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,500
Now notice this diagonal line, the crease of the fold.

156
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,000
It represents all pairs of points that look like xx, meaning the pairs which are really

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,860
just a single point written twice.

158
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
Right now, it's marked with a red line.

159
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,000
And you should remember it.

160
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,160
It will become important to know where all of these pairs like xx live.

161
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,420
But we still have some arrows to glue together here.

162
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,960
We need to glue that bottom edge to the right edge.

163
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,800
And the orientation with which we do this is going to be important.

164
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,940
Points towards the left of the bottom edge have to be glued to points towards the bottom

165
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,900
of the right edge.

166
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,620
And points towards the right of the bottom edge have to be glued to points towards the

167
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
top of the right edge.

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
It's weird to think about, right?

169
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,540
Go ahead, pause and ponder this for a moment.

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,760
The trick, which is kind of clever, is to make a diagonal cut, which we need to remember

171
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
to glue back in just a moment.

172
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,620
After that, we can glue the bottom and the right like so.

173
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,200
But notice the orientation of the arrows here.

174
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,180
To glue back what we just cut, we don't simply connect the edges of this rectangle to get

175
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,660
a cylinder.

176
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,320
We have to make a twist.

177
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Doing this in 3D space, the shape we get is a Möbius strip.

178
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,420
Isn't that awesome?

179
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,980
Evidently, the surface which represents all pairs of unordered points on the loop is the

180
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,700
Möbius strip.

181
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,240
And notice, the edge of this strip, shown here in red, represents the pairs of points

182
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,820
that look like xx, those which are really just a single point listed twice.

183
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,040
The Möbius strip is to unordered pairs of points on the loop what the xy-plane is to

184
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,220
pairs of real numbers.

185
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,020
That totally blew my mind when I first saw it.

186
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,880
Now, with this fact that there is a continuous one-to-one association between unordered

187
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,320
pairs of points on the loop and individual points on this Möbius strip, we can solve

188
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
the inscribed rectangle problem.

189
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,640
Remember, we had defined this special kind of graph in 3D space, where the loop was sitting

190
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
in the xy-plane.

191
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,560
For each pair of points, you consider their midpoint m, which lives on the xy-plane, and

192
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,780
their distance d apart, and you plot a point which is exactly d units above m.

193
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,640
Because of the continuous one-to-one association between pairs of points on the loop and the

194
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,840
Möbius strip, this gives us a natural map from the Möbius strip onto this surface in

195
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,740
3D space.

196
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,040
For every point on the Möbius strip, consider the pair of points on the loop that it represents,

197
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,220
then plug that pair of points into the special function.

198
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,440
And here's the key point.

199
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,920
When pairs of points on the loop are extremely close together, the output of the function

200
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,380
is right above the loop itself, and in the extreme case of pairs of points like xx, the

201
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,840
output of the function is exactly on the loop.

202
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,500
Since points on this red edge of the Möbius strip correspond to pairs like xx, when the

203
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,900
Möbius strip is mapped onto this surface, it must be done in such a way that the edge

204
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,660
of the strip gets mapped right onto that loop in the xy-plane.

205
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,500
But if you stand back and think about it for a moment, considering the strange shape of

206
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,980
the Möbius strip, there is no way to glue its edge to something two-dimensional without

207
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,260
forcing the strip to intersect itself.

208
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,500
Since points of the Möbius strip represent pairs of points on the loop, if the strip

209
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:07,480
intersects itself during this mapping, it means that there are at least two distinct

210
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,900
pairs of points that correspond to the same output on this surface, which means they share

211
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,620
a midpoint and are the same distance apart, which in turn means that they form a rectangle.

212
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,980
And that's the proof!

213
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,180
Or at least, if you're willing to trust me in saying that you can't glue the edge of

214
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,400
the Möbius strip to a plane without forcing it to intersect itself, then that's the

215
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,660
proof.

216
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,420
This fact is intuitively clear looking at the Möbius strip, but in order to make it

217
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,140
rigorous, you basically need to start developing the field of topology.

218
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,640
In fact, for any of you who have a topology class in your future, going through the exercise

219
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,320
of trying to justify this is a good way to gain an appreciation for why topologists choose

220
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,700
to make certain definitions.

221
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,580
And I want you to take note of something here.

222
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,520
The reason for talking about the torus and the Möbius strip was not because we were

223
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,540
playing around with construction paper, or because we were daydreaming about deforming

224
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,340
a coffee mug.

225
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,240
They came up as a natural way to understand pairs of points on a loop, and that's something

226
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,420
that we needed to solve a concrete problem.

227
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,960
Thank you.
