1
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,760
If I have a vector sitting here in 2D space, we have a standard way to describe it with

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
coordinates.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,920
In this case, the vector has coordinates 3, 2, which means going from its tail to its

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,160
tip involves moving three units to the right and two units up.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,100
Now the more linear algebra-oriented way to describe coordinates is to think of each of

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,060
these numbers as a scalar, a thing that stretches or squishes vectors.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,840
You think of that first coordinate as scaling i-hat, the vector with length 1 pointing to

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,600
the right, while the second coordinate scales j-hat, the vector with length 1 pointing straight

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,780
up.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:56,180
The tip-to-tail sum of those two scaled vectors is what the coordinates are meant to describe.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,740
You can think of these two special vectors as encapsulating all of the implicit assumptions

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,860
of our coordinate system.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,900
The fact that the first number indicates rightward motion, that the second one indicates upward

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,940
motion, exactly how far a unit of distance is, all of that is tied up in the choice of

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,060
i-hat and j-hat as the vectors which are scalar coordinates are meant to actually scale.

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,020
Any way to translate between vectors and sets of numbers is called a coordinate system,

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,360
and the two special vectors i-hat and j-hat are called the basis vectors of our standard

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,340
coordinate system.

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,060
What I'd like to talk about here is the idea of using a different set of basis vectors.

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,820
For example, let's say you have a friend, Jennifer, who uses a different set of basis

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,240
vectors, which I'll call b1 and b2.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,580
Her first basis vector, b1, points up and to the right a little bit, and her second

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,300
vector, b2, points left and up.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,180
Now take another look at that vector that I showed earlier, the one that you and I would

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,480
describe using the coordinates 3,2, using our basis vectors i-hat and j-hat.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,000
Jennifer would actually describe this vector with the coordinates 5 thirds and 1 third.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,340
What this means is that the particular way to get to that vector using her two basis

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:21,020
vectors is to scale b1 by 5 thirds, scale b2 by 1 third, then add them both together.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,340
In a little bit, I'll show you how you could have figured out those two numbers, 5 thirds

30
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,080
and 1 third.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
In general, whenever Jennifer uses coordinates to describe a vector, she thinks of her first

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,040
coordinate as scaling b1, the second coordinate as scaling b2, and she adds the results.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,420
What she gets will typically be completely different from the vector that you and I would

34
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,260
think of as having those coordinates.

35
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,820
To be a little more precise about the setup here, her first basis vector, b1, is something

36
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,620
that we would describe with the coordinates 2,1, and her second basis vector, b2, is something

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,260
that we would describe as negative 1,1.

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,540
But it's important to realize from her perspective in her system, those vectors have coordinates

39
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,460
1,0 and 0,1.

40
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,940
They are what define the meaning of the coordinates 1,0 and 0,1 in her world.

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,220
So in effect, we're speaking different languages.

42
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,360
We're all looking at the same vectors in space, but Jennifer uses different words and

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,700
numbers to describe them.

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,660
Let me say a quick word about how I'm representing things here.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,440
When I animate 2D space, I typically use this square grid.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,880
But that grid is just a construct, a way to visualize our coordinate system, and so it

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,360
depends on our choice of basis.

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,860
Space itself has no intrinsic grid.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,260
Jennifer might draw her own grid, which would be an equally made up construct meant as nothing

50
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,460
more than a visual tool to help follow the meaning of her coordinates.

51
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,020
Her origin though would actually line up with ours, since everybody agrees on what the coordinates

52
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,980
0,0 should mean.

53
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,820
It's the thing that you get when you scale any vector by zero.

54
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,340
But the direction of her axes and the spacing of her grid lines will be different, depending

55
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,620
on her choice of basis vectors.

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,260
So after all this is set up, a pretty natural question to ask is how we translate between

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,640
coordinate systems.

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,100
If for example Jennifer describes a vector with coordinates negative 1, 2, what would

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,420
that be in our coordinate system?

60
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,300
How do you translate from her language to ours?

61
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,660
Well, what her coordinates are saying is that this vector is negative 1 times b1 plus 2

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,900
times b2.

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:49,660
And from our perspective, b1 has coordinates 2, 1, and b2 has coordinates negative 1, 1.

64
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,940
So we can actually compute negative 1 times b1 plus 2 times b2 as they're represented

65
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,860
in our coordinate system.

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,100
And working this out, you get a vector with coordinates negative 4, 1.

67
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,900
So that's how we would describe the vector that she thinks of as negative 1, 2.

68
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,360
This process here of scaling each of her basis vectors by the corresponding coordinates

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,580
of some vector, then adding them together, might feel somewhat familiar.

70
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,280
It's matrix vector multiplication, with a matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,800
basis vectors in our language.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,300
In fact, once you understand matrix vector multiplication as applying a certain linear

73
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,660
transformation, say by watching what I view to be the most important video in this series,

74
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,700
Chapter 3, there's a pretty intuitive way to think about what's going on here.

75
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,180
A matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectors can be thought of as a transformation

76
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,580
that moves our basis vectors, i-hat and j-hat, the things we think of when we say 1, 0 and

77
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:59,080
0, 1, to Jennifer's basis vectors, the things she thinks of when she says 1, 0 and 0, 1.

78
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,420
To show how this works, let's walk through what it would mean to take the vector that

79
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,180
we think of as having coordinates negative 1, 2 and applying that transformation.

80
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,540
Before the linear transformation, we're thinking of this vector as a certain linear combination

81
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,500
of our basis vectors, negative 1 times i-hat plus 2 times j-hat.

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,560
And the key feature of a linear transformation is that the resulting vector will be that

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,900
same linear combination but of the new basis vectors, negative 1 times the place where

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,740
i-hat lands plus 2 times the place where j-hat lands.

85
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,260
So what this matrix does is transform our misconception of what Jennifer means into

86
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,340
the actual vector that she's referring to.

87
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,460
I remember that when I was first learning this, it always felt kind of backwards to

88
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
me.

89
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,660
Geometrically, this matrix transforms our grid into Jennifer's grid but numerically,

90
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:01,100
it's translating a vector described in her language to our language.

91
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,140
What made it finally click for me was thinking about how it takes our misconception of what

92
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,060
Jennifer means, the vector we get using the same coordinates but in our system, then it

93
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,400
transforms it into the vector that she really meant.

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,200
What about going the other way around?

95
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,020
In the example I used earlier this video, when I had the vector with coordinates 3,

96
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,180
2 in our system, how did I compute that it would have coordinates 5 thirds and 1 third

97
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,380
in Jennifer's system?

98
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,340
You start with that change of basis matrix that translates Jennifer's language into ours,

99
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,700
then you take its inverse.

100
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:48,180
Remember, the inverse of a transformation is a new transformation that corresponds to

101
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,640
playing that first one backwards.

102
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,540
In practice, especially when you're working in more than two dimensions, you'd use a computer

103
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,320
to compute the matrix that actually represents this inverse.

104
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,640
In this case, the inverse of the change of basis matrix that has Jennifer's basis as

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:10,480
its columns ends up working out to have columns 1 third, negative 1 third, and 1 third, 2

106
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
thirds.

107
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,040
So for example, to see what the vector 3, 2 looks like in Jennifer's system, we multiply

108
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,400
this inverse change of basis matrix by the vector 3, 2, which works out to be 5 thirds,

109
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,960
1 third.

110
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,880
So that, in a nutshell, is how to translate the description of individual vectors back

111
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
and forth between coordinate systems.

112
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,920
The matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectors, but written in our coordinates,

113
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,760
translates vectors from her language into our language.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,360
And the inverse matrix does the opposite.

115
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,680
But vectors aren't the only thing that we describe using coordinates.

116
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,420
For this next part, it's important that you're all comfortable representing transformations

117
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,600
with matrices, and that you know how matrix multiplication corresponds to composing successive

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
transformations.

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Definitely pause and take a look at chapters 3 and 4 if any of that feels uneasy.

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,160
Consider some linear transformation, like a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation.

121
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,240
When you and I represent this with a matrix, we follow where the basis vectors i-hat and

122
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,440
j-hat each go.

123
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,720
i-hat ends up at the spot with coordinates 0, 1, and j-hat ends up at the spot with coordinates

124
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,600
negative 1, 0.

125
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,440
So those coordinates become the columns of our matrix.

126
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,300
But this representation is heavily tied up in our choice of basis vectors, from the fact

127
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,420
that we're following i-hat and j-hat in the first place, to the fact that we're recording

128
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,340
their landing spots in our own coordinate system.

129
00:09:50,340 --> 00:10:00,280
How would Jennifer describe this same 90 degree rotation of space?

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,140
You might be tempted to just translate the columns of our rotation matrix into Jennifer's

131
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,260
language.

132
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,700
But that's not quite right.

133
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,960
Those columns represent where our basis vectors i-hat and j-hat go, but the matrix that Jennifer

134
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,880
wants should represent where her basis vectors land, and it needs to describe those landing

135
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,860
spots in her language.

136
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,760
Here's a common way to think of how this is done.

137
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,260
Start with any vector written in Jennifer's language.

138
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,220
Rather than trying to follow what happens to it in terms of her language, first we're

139
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,120
going to translate it into our language using the change of basis matrix, the one whose

140
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,880
columns represent her basis vectors in our language.

141
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,000
This gives us the same vector, but now written in our language.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,360
Then apply the transformation matrix to what you get by multiplying it on the left.

143
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,660
This tells us where that vector lands, but still in our language.

144
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,360
So as a last step, apply the inverse change of basis matrix, multiplied on the left as

145
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,380
usual, to get the transformed vector, but now in Jennifer's language.

146
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,340
Since we could do this with any vector written in her language, first applying the change

147
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,180
of basis, then the transformation, then the inverse change of basis, that composition

148
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,980
of three matrices gives us the transformation matrix in Jennifer's language.

149
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,600
It takes in a vector of her language and spits out the transformed version of that vector

150
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,420
in her language.

151
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,980
For this specific example, when Jennifer's basis vectors look like 2, 1 and negative

152
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,580
in our language, and when the transformation is a 90 degree rotation, the product of these

153
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,140
three matrices, if you work through it, has columns one third, five thirds, and negative

154
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,760
two thirds, negative one third.

155
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,140
So if Jennifer multiplies that matrix by the coordinates of a vector in her system, it

156
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,420
will return the 90 degree rotated version of that vector expressed in her coordinate

157
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,180
system.

158
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,740
In general, whenever you see an expression like A inverse times M times A, it suggests

159
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,340
a mathematical sort of empathy.

160
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,020
That middle matrix represents a transformation of some kind as you see it, and the outer

161
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,820
two matrices represent the empathy, the shift in perspective.

162
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,580
And the full matrix product represents that same transformation, but as someone else sees

163
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,800
it.

164
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,760
For those of you wondering why we care about alternate coordinate systems, the next video

165
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,600
on eigenvectors and eigenvalues will give a really important example of this.

166
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:48,600
See you then!
