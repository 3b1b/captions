1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,169
If I have a vector sitting here in 2D space, we 

2
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:17,780
have a standard way to describe it with coordinates.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,183
In this case, the vector has coordinates 3, 2, 

4
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:25,313
which means going from its tail to its tip involves moving three units to 

5
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,820
the right and two units up.

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,753
Now, the more linear algebra-oriented way to describe coordinates is to think 

7
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:36,160
of each of these numbers as a scalar, a thing that stretches or squishes vectors.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,385
You think of that first coordinate as scaling i-hat, 

9
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:43,432
the vector with length 1 pointing to the right, 

10
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:49,020
while the second coordinate scales j-hat, the vector with length 1 pointing straight up.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,254
The tip-to-tail sum of those two scaled vectors 

12
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:54,740
is what the coordinates are meant to describe.

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,889
You can think of these two special vectors as encapsulating 

14
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,920
all of the implicit assumptions of our coordinate system.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,899
The fact that the first number indicates rightward motion, 

16
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,226
that the second one indicates upward motion, exactly how far a unit of distance is, 

17
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:13,471
all of that is tied up in the choice of i-hat and j-hat as the 

18
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,820
vectors which are scalar coordinates are meant to actually scale.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,028
Any way to translate between vectors and sets of numbers is called a coordinate system, 

20
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:26,801
and the two special vectors i-hat and j-hat are called the basis 

21
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:29,240
vectors of our standard coordinate system.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
What I'd like to talk about here is the idea of using a different set of basis vectors.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,168
For example, let's say you have a friend, Jennifer, 

24
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:43,480
who uses a different set of basis vectors, which I'll call b1 and b2.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,328
Her first basis vector, b1, points up and to the right a little bit, 

26
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:51,160
and her second vector, b2, points left and up.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,880
Now take another look at that vector that I showed earlier, 

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,260
the one that you and I would describe using the coordinates 3,2, 

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,340
using our basis vectors i-hat and j-hat.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,900
Jennifer would actually describe this vector with the coordinates 5 thirds and 1 third.

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,380
What this means is that the particular way to get to that vector using her two basis 

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,940
vectors is to scale b1 by 5 thirds, scale b2 by 1 third, then add them both together.

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,990
In a little bit, I'll show you how you could have figured out those two numbers, 

34
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,880
5 thirds and 1 third.

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,723
In general, whenever Jennifer uses coordinates to describe a vector, 

36
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:32,436
she thinks of her first coordinate as scaling b1, 

37
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,800
the second coordinate as scaling b2, and she adds the results.

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,309
What she gets will typically be completely different from the 

39
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:42,920
vector that you and I would think of as having those coordinates.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,386
To be a little more precise about the setup here, her first basis vector, 

41
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:53,335
b1, is something that we would describe with the coordinates 2,1, 

42
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:58,420
and her second basis vector, b2, is something that we would describe as negative 1,1.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,124
But it's important to realize from her perspective in her system, 

44
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:05,760
those vectors have coordinates 1,0 and 0,1.

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,600
They are what define the meaning of the coordinates 1,0 and 0,1 in her world.

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,340
So in effect, we're speaking different languages.

47
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,090
We're all looking at the same vectors in space, 

48
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,700
but Jennifer uses different words and numbers to describe them.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,060
Let me say a quick word about how I'm representing things here.

50
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,780
When I animate 2D space, I typically use this square grid.

51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,280
But that grid is just a construct, a way to visualize our coordinate system, 

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,400
and so it depends on our choice of basis.

53
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,500
Space itself has no intrinsic grid.

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,581
Jennifer might draw her own grid, which would be an equally made up construct meant 

55
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:49,460
as nothing more than a visual tool to help follow the meaning of her coordinates.

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,976
Her origin though would actually line up with ours, 

57
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:59,220
since everybody agrees on what the coordinates 0,0 should mean.

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,740
It's the thing that you get when you scale any vector by 0.

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,729
But the direction of her axes and the spacing of her grid lines will be different, 

60
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,760
depending on her choice of basis vectors.

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,316
So after all this is set up, a pretty natural question 

62
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,140
to ask is how we translate between coordinate systems.

63
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,114
If for example, Jennifer describes a vector with coordinates negative 1,2, 

64
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:25,880
what would that be in our coordinate system?

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,520
How do you translate from her language to ours?

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,642
Well, what her coordinates are saying is that 

67
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:36,260
this vector is negative 1 times b1 plus 2 times b2.

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,700
And from our perspective, b1 has coordinates 2,1, and b2 has coordinates negative 1,1.

69
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,104
So we can actually compute negative 1 times b1 plus 2 

70
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:57,120
times b2 as they're represented in our coordinate system.

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,340
And working this out, you get a vector with coordinates negative 4,1.

72
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,540
So that's how we would describe the vector that she thinks of as negative 1,2.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,730
This process here of scaling each of her basis vectors by the corresponding 

74
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,560
coordinates of some vector, then adding them together, might feel somewhat familiar.

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,662
It's matrix-vector multiplication, with a matrix whose 

76
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:25,120
columns represent Jennifer's basis vectors in our language.

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,144
In fact, once you understand matrix-vector multiplication as applying a certain linear 

78
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:34,366
transformation, say by watching what I view to be the most important video in this 

79
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,740
series, chapter 3, there's a pretty intuitive way to think about what's going on here.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,853
A matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectors can be 

81
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:47,770
thought of as a transformation that moves our basis vectors, 

82
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,943
i-hat and j-hat, the things we think of when we say 1,0 and 0,1, 

83
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:57,080
to Jennifer's basis vectors, the things she thinks of when she says 1,0 and 0,1.

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,737
To show how this works, let's walk through what it would mean to take the vector 

85
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,080
that we think of as having coordinates negative 1,2 and applying that transformation.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,290
Before the linear transformation, we're thinking of this vector as a certain 

87
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,700
linear combination of our basis vectors, negative 1 times i-hat plus 2 times j-hat.

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,025
And the key feature of a linear transformation is that the resulting vector 

89
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:26,192
will be that same linear combination but of the new basis vectors, 

90
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:31,540
negative 1 times the place where i-hat lands plus 2 times the place where j-hat lands.

91
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,686
So what this matrix does is transform our misconception of what 

92
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:41,780
Jennifer means into the actual vector that she's referring to.

93
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,800
I remember that when I was first learning this, it always felt kind of backwards to me.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,119
Geometrically, this matrix transforms our grid into Jennifer's grid, 

95
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:57,440
but numerically, it's translating a vector described in her language to our language.

96
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,428
What made it finally click for me was thinking about how it takes our 

97
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:08,027
misconception of what Jennifer means, the vector we get using the same 

98
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,981
coordinates but in our system, then it transforms it into the vector that she 

99
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:12,640
really meant.

100
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,820
What about going the other way around?

101
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,591
In the example I used earlier this video, when I had the vector with coordinates 3, 

102
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:26,104
2 in our system, how did I compute that it would have coordinates 

103
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,340
5 thirds and 1 third in Jennifer's system?

104
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,906
You start with that change of basis matrix that translates Jennifer's language into ours, 

105
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,260
then you take its inverse.

106
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,967
Remember, the inverse of a transformation is a new transformation 

107
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,800
that corresponds to playing that first one backwards.

108
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,523
In practice, especially when you're working in more than two dimensions, 

109
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:57,100
you'd use a computer to compute the matrix that actually represents this inverse.

110
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,927
In this case, the inverse of the change of basis matrix that 

111
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:06,902
has Jennifer's basis as its columns ends up working out to have columns 1 third, 

112
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:09,360
negative 1 third, and 1 third, 2 thirds.

113
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,530
So, for example, to see what the vector 3, 2 looks like in Jennifer's system, 

114
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,905
we multiply this inverse change of basis matrix by the vector 3, 

115
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,800
2, which works out to be 5 thirds, 1 third.

116
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,968
So that, in a nutshell, is how to translate the description of 

117
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,539
individual vectors back and forth between coordinate systems.

118
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,532
The matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectors but written 

119
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:43,780
in our coordinates translates vectors from her language into our language.

120
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,700
And the inverse matrix does the opposite.

121
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,360
But vectors aren't the only thing that we describe using coordinates.

122
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,772
For this next part, it's important that you're all comfortable 

123
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,983
representing transformations with matrices and that you know how 

124
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:05,640
matrix multiplication corresponds to composing successive transformations.

125
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,780
Definitely pause and take a look at chapters 3 and 4 if any of that feels uneasy.

126
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,280
Consider some linear transformation, like a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation.

127
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,053
When you and I represent this with a matrix, we 

128
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,620
follow where the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat each go.

129
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,395
i-hat ends up at the spot with coordinates 0, 1, 

130
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:31,900
and j-hat ends up at the spot with coordinates negative 1, 0.

131
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,400
So those coordinates become the columns of our matrix.

132
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,304
But this representation is heavily tied up in our choice of basis vectors, 

133
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:44,144
from the fact that we're following i-hat and j-hat in the first place to 

134
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:48,300
the fact that we're recording their landing spots in our own coordinate system.

135
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,440
How would Jennifer describe this same 90 degree rotation of space?

136
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,701
You might be tempted to just translate the columns 

137
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,640
of our rotation matrix into Jennifer's language.

138
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,140
But that's not quite right.

139
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,460
Those columns represent where our basis vectors i-hat and j-hat go.

140
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,070
But the matrix that Jennifer wants should represent where her basis vectors land, 

141
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,500
and it needs to describe those landing spots in her language.

142
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,760
Here's a common way to think of how this is done.

143
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,120
Start with any vector written in Jennifer's language.

144
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,021
Rather than trying to follow what happens to it in terms of her language, 

145
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:35,626
first we're going to translate it into our language using the change of basis matrix, 

146
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:39,160
the one whose columns represent her basis vectors in our language.

147
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,680
This gives us the same vector but now written in our language.

148
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,380
Then apply the transformation matrix to what you get by multiplying it on the left.

149
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,560
This tells us where that vector lands, but still in our language.

150
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,082
So as a last step, apply the inverse change of basis matrix, 

151
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:01,331
multiplied on the left as usual, to get the transformed vector but now in 

152
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,480
Jennifer's language.

153
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,038
Since we could do this with any vector written in her language, 

154
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:11,601
first applying the change of basis, then the transformation, 

155
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:16,391
then the inverse change of basis, that composition of three matrices gives us the 

156
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:19,020
transformation matrix in Jennifer's language.

157
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,380
It takes in a vector of her language and spits out 

158
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,400
the transformed version of that vector in her language.

159
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,516
For this specific example, when Jennifer's basis vectors look like 2, 

160
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:35,885
1 and negative 1, 1 in our language, and when the transformation is a 90 degree rotation, 

161
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:40,777
the product of these three matrices, if you work through it, has columns 1 third, 

162
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,760
5 thirds, and negative 2 thirds, negative 1 third.

163
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,627
So if Jennifer multiplies that matrix by the coordinates of a vector in her system, 

164
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:55,104
it will return the 90 degree rotated version of that vector expressed in her coordinate 

165
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:55,540
system.

166
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,755
In general, whenever you see an expression like A inverse times M times A, 

167
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:06,620
it suggests a mathematical sort of empathy.

168
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,390
That middle matrix represents a transformation of some kind as you see it, 

169
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,640
and the outer two matrices represent the empathy, the shift in perspective.

170
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,414
And the full matrix product represents that same 

171
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:21,920
transformation but as someone else sees it.

172
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,768
For those of you wondering why we care about alternate coordinate systems, 

173
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:31,325
the next video on eigenvectors and eigenvalues will give a really important example 

174
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:31,760
of this.
