00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,721
Hey everyone, where we last left off, I showed what linear 

2
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,880
transformations look like and how to represent them using matrices.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,154
This is worth a quick recap because it's just really important, 

4
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:25,140
but of course if this feels like more than just a recap, go back and watch the full video.

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,577
Technically speaking, linear transformations are functions with vectors 

6
00:00:29,577 --> 00:00:33,480
as inputs and vectors as outputs, but I showed last time how we can think 

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,171
about them visually as smooshing around space in such a way that grid 

8
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:41,180
lines stay parallel and evenly spaced, and so that the origin remains fixed.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,635
The key takeaway was that a linear transformation is completely determined by where it 

10
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:51,340
takes the basis vectors of the space, which for two dimensions means i-hat and j-hat.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,491
This is because any other vector could be described 

12
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:57,340
as a linear combination of those basis vectors.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,340
A vector with coordinates x, y is x times i-hat plus y times j-hat.

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,563
After going through the transformation, this property that grid 

15
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:09,860
lines remain parallel and evenly spaced has a wonderful consequence.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,112
The place where your vector lands will be x times the transformed 

17
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:17,560
version of i-hat plus y times the transformed version of j-hat.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,682
This means if you keep a record of the coordinates where i-hat lands and the 

19
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,297
coordinates where j-hat lands, you can compute that a vector which starts at x, 

20
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:32,200
y must land on x times the new coordinates of i-hat plus y times the new coordinates 

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,720
of j-hat.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,418
The convention is to record the coordinates of where i-hat and j-hat 

23
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:41,333
land as the columns of a matrix, and to define this sum of the scaled 

24
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:45,360
versions of those columns by x and y to be matrix-vector multiplication.

25
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,132
In this way, a matrix represents a specific linear transformation, 

26
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:53,423
and multiplying a matrix by a vector is what it means 

27
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:57,080
computationally to apply that transformation to that vector.

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,880
Alright, recap over, on to the new stuff.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,250
Oftentimes, you find yourself wanting to describe the 

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,000
effects of applying one transformation and then another.

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,127
For example, maybe you want to describe what happens when you first 

32
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:14,480
rotate the plane 90 degrees counterclockwise, then apply a shear.

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,779
The overall effect here, from start to finish, 

34
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:21,800
is another linear transformation, distinct from the rotation and the shear.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,118
This new linear transformation is commonly called the 

36
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:28,220
composition of the two separate transformations we applied.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,122
And like any linear transformation, it can be described 

38
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:35,440
with a matrix all of its own by following i-hat and j-hat.

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,261
In this example, the ultimate landing spot for i-hat after both transformations is 1,1, 

40
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,120
so let's make that the first column of a matrix.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,929
Likewise, j-hat ultimately ends up at the location negative 1,0, 

42
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,860
so we make that the second column of the matrix.

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,726
This new matrix captures the overall effect of applying a rotation then a shear, 

44
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:01,340
but as one single action, rather than two successive ones.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,880
Here's one way to think about that new matrix.

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,955
If you were to take some vector and pump it through the rotation, then the shear, 

47
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:14,601
the long way to compute where it ends up is to first multiply it on the left by the 

48
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:19,412
rotation matrix, then take whatever you get and multiply that on the left by the shear 

49
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:19,800
matrix.

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,260
This is, numerically speaking, what it means to 

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,060
apply a rotation then a shear to a given vector.

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,418
But whatever you get should be the same as just applying this new composition matrix 

53
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:35,384
that we just found by that same vector, no matter what vector you chose, 

54
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:40,002
since this new matrix is supposed to capture the same overall effect as the rotation 

55
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:40,980
then shear action.

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,857
Based on how things are written down here, I think it's reasonable to 

57
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:49,380
call this new matrix the product of the original two matrices, don't you?

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,976
We can think about how to compute that product more generally in just a moment, 

59
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:56,600
but it's way too easy to get lost in the forest of numbers.

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,500
Always remember that multiplying two matrices like this has the 

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,280
geometric meaning of applying one transformation then another.

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,660
One thing that's kind of weird here is that this has us reading from right to left.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,448
You first apply the transformation represented by the matrix on the right, 

64
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:16,720
then you apply the transformation represented by the matrix on the left.

65
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,525
This stems from function notation, since we write functions on the left of variables, 

66
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:25,460
so every time you compose two functions, you always have to read it right to left.

67
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,980
Good news for the Hebrew readers, bad news for the rest of us.

68
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,100
Let's look at another example.

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,860
Take the matrix with columns 1,1 and negative 2,0, whose transformation looks like this.

70
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,060
And let's call it M1.

71
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,700
Next, take the matrix with columns 0,1 and 2,0, whose transformation looks like this.

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,240
And let's call that guy M2.

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,180
The total effect of applying M1 then M2 gives us a new transformation, 

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,680
so let's find its matrix.

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,465
But this time, let's see if we can do it without watching the animations, 

76
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:03,860
and instead just using the numerical entries in each matrix.

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,140
First, we need to figure out where i-hat goes.

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,483
After applying M1, the new coordinates of i-hat, 

79
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:15,980
by definition, are given by that first column of M1, namely 1,1.

80
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,500
To see what happens after applying M2, multiply the matrix for M2 by that vector 1,1.

81
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,880
Working it out, the way I described last video, you'll get the vector 2,1.

82
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,100
This will be the first column of the composition matrix.

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,530
Likewise, to follow j-hat, the second column of 

84
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,540
M1 tells us that it first lands on negative 2,0.

85
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,027
Then, when we apply M2 to that vector, you can work out the matrix-vector product 

86
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:55,200
to get 0, negative 2, which becomes the second column of our composition matrix.

87
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,828
Let me talk through that same process again, but this time I'll show variable entries 

88
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:04,920
in each matrix, just to show that the same line of reasoning works for any matrices.

89
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,262
This is more symbol-heavy and will require some more room, 

90
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:12,137
but it should be pretty satisfying for anyone who has previously been taught matrix 

91
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,660
multiplication the more rote way.

92
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,784
To follow where i-hat goes, start by looking at the first column of 

93
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:21,060
the matrix on the right, since this is where i-hat initially lands.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,176
Multiplying that column by the matrix on the left is how you can tell where the 

95
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:30,300
intermediate version of i-hat ends up after applying the second transformation.

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,675
So the first column of the composition matrix will always 

97
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:38,100
equal the left matrix times the first column of the right matrix.

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,140
Likewise, j-hat will always initially land on the second column of the right matrix.

99
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,597
So multiplying the left matrix by this second column will give its final location, 

100
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:57,020
and hence that's the second column of the composition matrix.

101
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,804
Notice there's a lot of symbols here, and it's common to be taught this formula as 

102
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:09,040
something to memorize, along with a certain algorithmic process to help remember it.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,137
But I really do think that before memorizing that process, 

104
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:15,064
you should get in the habit of thinking about what matrix 

105
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:18,900
multiplication really represents, applying one transformation after another.

106
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,888
Trust me, this will give you a much better conceptual framework that 

107
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:26,300
makes the properties of matrix multiplication much easier to understand.

108
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,360
For example, here's a question.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,840
Does it matter what order we put the two matrices in when we multiply them?

110
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, let's think through a simple example, like the one from earlier.

111
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,456
Take a shear, which fixes i-hat and smooshes j-hat over to the right, 

112
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:42,820
and a 90 degree rotation.

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,313
If you first do the shear, then rotate, we can see that 

114
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:50,960
i-hat ends up at 0,1 and j-hat ends up at negative 1,1.

115
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,060
Both are generally pointing close together.

116
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,401
If you first rotate, then do the shear, i-hat ends up over at 1,1, 

117
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:03,893
and j-hat is off in a different direction at negative 1,0, and they're pointing, 

118
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,520
you know, farther apart.

119
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,660
The overall effect here is clearly different, so evidently, order totally does matter.

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,542
Notice, by thinking in terms of transformations, 

121
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,840
that's the kind of thing that you can do in your head by visualizing.

122
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,900
No matrix multiplication necessary.

123
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,300
I remember when I first took linear algebra, there was this one homework 

124
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,120
problem that asked us to prove that matrix multiplication is associative.

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,868
This means that if you have three matrices, A, B, and C, 

126
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:37,975
and you multiply them all together, it shouldn't matter if you first compute A times B, 

127
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,864
then multiply the result by C, or if you first multiply B times C, 

128
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:44,360
then multiply that result by A on the left.

129
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,400
In other words, it doesn't matter where you put the parentheses.

130
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,258
Now, if you try to work through this numerically, like I did back then, 

131
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:55,760
it's horrible, just horrible, and unenlightening for that matter.

132
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,127
But when you think about matrix multiplication as applying 

133
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:02,780
one transformation after another, this property is just trivial.

134
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,000
Can you see why?

135
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,725
What it's saying is that if you first apply C, then B, 

136
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:12,380
then A, it's the same as applying C, then B, then A.

137
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,380
I mean, there's nothing to prove.

138
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,660
You're just applying the same three things one after the other, all in the same order.

139
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,540
This might feel like cheating, but it's not.

140
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,863
This is an honest-to-goodness proof that matrix multiplication is associative, 

141
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:30,680
and even better than that, it's a good explanation for why that property should be true.

142
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,555
I really do encourage you to play around more with this idea, 

143
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:38,130
imagining two different transformations, thinking about what happens when 

144
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,140
you apply one after the other, and then working out the matrix product numerically.

145
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,440
Trust me, this is the kind of playtime that really makes the idea sink in.

146
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,091
In the next video, I'll start talking about extending 

147
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,180
these ideas beyond just two dimensions.
