1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,820
Usually, I don't think notation and math matters that much.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,120
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a bad notation rant as much as the next guy, and there are

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,920
clearly a few simple changes to our conventions that could speed up learning for math students

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,400
everywhere.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,160
But at the end of the day, notation, good or bad, is just not the point of math.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,720
Even the most carefully designed symbols and syntax will fail to capture the underlying

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,940
visual that constitutes understanding, so I figure it's better to just spend time

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,200
focusing on that underlying essence and let the symbols just be what they are in peace.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,560
But that said, when unintuitive notation actively stalls the gears of learning, my disposition

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,120
on the matter hardens up a little bit.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,820
In particular, I'm thinking of one threesome of syntax which, when you stop and think about

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,640
it, is an egregious source of friction in math education everywhere.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,700
If you take the fact that 2 multiplied by itself 3 times equals 8, for example, we have

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,720
three separate ways to explain that relationship.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,700
2 cubed equals 8, with a superscript.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,400
The cube root of 8 is 2, with a squaggly radical symbol.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,400
And the log base 2 of 8 equals 3, which we write using the word log itself.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,320
What the hell do these three ways of writing the same fact have to do with each other?

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,580
Making up syntax for a concept is fine, but don't do it in three completely different

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,700
ways for the same concept and force students to learn every rule about that concept three

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,500
separate times.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,020
It's like it's a different language.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,580
This way of writing things isn't just counterintuitive, it's counter-mathematical, since rather than

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,940
making seemingly different facts look the same, which is what math should do, it takes

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,560
three facts which should obviously be the same and makes them look artificially different.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,540
Just think about how confusing logarithms were the first time you learned about them.

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,620
This is, of course, a known issue, and the internet has no shortage of people raising

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,100
the same concern with suggestions for a better notation.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,400
But recently, I stumbled across a math exchange post with a suggestion so lovely, so symmetrical,

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,880
so utterly reasonable, that I just have to share it.

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,360
For a relationship like 2 cubed equals 8, take a triangle and write 2 in the lower left,

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,600
3 on the top, and 8 on the lower right.

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,080
To express the operation 2 cubed, remove that bottom right corner.

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,300
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,680
To express log base 2 of 8, which is asking the question 2 to the what equals 8, remove

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,420
the top number.

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,080
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,420
To express the cube root of 8, which is saying what number to the third power equals 8, remove

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,360
the bottom left corner.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,020
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,740
In other words, all three operations are completely symmetrically represented.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,300
This triangle deserves a name, and a friend of mine at Khan Academy decided that we should

43
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,880
call it the triangle of power.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,420
The definition alone is mildly pleasing, but where it gets fun is when you see how much

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,580
smoother all of the different operations become.

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,360
In our current notation, there are 6 different ways to express the various inverse operations.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,700
Most of these are memorized as separate entities, some are rarely even talked about, and there's

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,540
no discernible pattern even though all of them describe the same basic idea.

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,660
But students still have to spend 6 times the effort to memorize each one, are 6 times more

50
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,180
likely to make a mistake, and have 6 separate opportunities to decide math is dumb and boring

51
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,100
and conducive to failure and why don't I just go study art instead?

52
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,620
With the triangle of power, all these operations follow the same pattern.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,940
Our brains are really good at picking up on patterns like this, and you can much more

54
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,200
easily imagine a smooth mental image associated with the property.

55
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,760
There's even kind of an aesthetic pleasure to this, and who knows, maybe more of the

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
artistically inclined students would look favorably upon math long enough to see just

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
how valuable their intuitions really are in the science.

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,960
Let's take another property, like the idea that a to the x times a to the y equals a

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,980
to the x plus y.

60
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,660
The corresponding fact for logarithms is that log of x times y equals log of x plus log

61
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,100
of y.

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,280
When you write this with the triangle of power, it's a little easier to see that both of these

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
expressions are really saying the same thing.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,440
Remember, the symbol as a whole represents the number at the missing corner, so the top

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
expression is saying that when you multiply two numbers that belong on the bottom right

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,380
of the triangle, it corresponds with adding the numbers that belong to the top.

67
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,240
But that's also what the lower expression is saying, when you multiply the numbers at

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,640
the bottom right, it corresponds with adding numbers that belong to the top.

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,900
To help students with this, you could draw inside of the triangle, saying that when the

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,360
lower left is constant, the numbers at the top like to add, while the bottom right numbers

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,260
like to multiply.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,200
What about when a different corner stays constant, like the top?

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,920
Well in this case, you'd write a multiplication sign in both the bottom corners, because with

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,460
exponents and radicals, multiplication turns into multiplication.

75
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,080
The natural question that a student might ask from here is if there's an analogous rule

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,120
for when the lower right stays constant.

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,560
There is!

78
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,520
You have to introduce a new operation, which for the sake of this video, I'll call O+,

79
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,800
where A O plus B equals one over one over A plus one over B.

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,340
This is not actually a ridiculous thing to introduce, since it comes up in physics all

81
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,940
the time, like when you're computing parallel resistance.

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,140
With that symbol, you could say that when the lower right number stays constant, the

83
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,480
top numbers like to get O-plussed together, and the bottom left numbers like to get multiplied.

84
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,120
This is actually a really nice connection between logarithms and roots, and it never

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,700
gets discussed, probably because the notation isn't really conducive to asking the question.

86
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,520
I could go on and on here, showing a lot of other properties, but honestly, I think the

87
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,540
best case I can make here is to encourage you to explore it for yourself, and notice

88
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,240
that just about everything involving exponents, logs, or radicals becomes nicer when you use

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,280
the triangle of power.

90
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,360
By the way, I hope that it goes without saying that in this perfect world, students wouldn't

91
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,380
learn these operations purely from the symbols.

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,320
They should still ask why it's true, and why it doesn't follow a different pattern.

93
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,620
But the point is that when the notation actually reflects the math, the questions that students

94
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,900
are most naturally asking tend to be the ones that cut right into the essence of what's

95
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,720
going on.

96
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,440
The asymmetries in the notation correspond with actual asymmetries in the numerical relationship

97
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,900
a to the b equals c itself, not in the artificial asymmetries of squiggles and words.

98
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,340
When a student asks why the top likes to get added in one context but O-plussed in another,

99
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,140
the teacher can point out the property that reflecting the triangle reciprocates the top,

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,200
and then they can start addressing where that fact comes from.

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,380
My sincere hope is that students don't learn by symbolic patterns, but by substantive reasoning

102
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,340
and re-derivation within their own heads.

103
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,780
But the fact is, most of us do first learn things by symbolic manipulation, so when there's

104
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,540
an opportunity to significantly speed up that process, we should take it!

105
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,760
And if you agree with me that the triangle of power is clearly better than what we have

106
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,700
already, start actually using it in your notes to see what it feels like.

107
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,700
Spread the word!

108
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,880
And, if you're a teacher, maybe start teaching this to your students so that we can get them

109
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
hooked while they're young.
