1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Usually, I don't think notation and math matters that much.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,000
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a bad notation rant as much as the next guy, and there are

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,080
clearly a few simple changes to our conventions that could speed up learning for math students

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
everywhere.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,820
But at the end of the day, notation, good or bad, is just not the point of math.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,680
Even the most carefully designed symbols and syntax will fail to capture the underlying

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,860
visual that constitutes understanding, so I figure it's better to just spend time

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,300
focusing on that underlying essence and let the symbols be what they are in peace.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,620
But that said, when unintuitive notation actively stalls the gears of learning, my disposition

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,620
on the matter hardens up a little bit.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,940
In particular, I'm thinking of one threesome of syntax which, when you stop and think about

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,740
it, is an egregious source of friction in math education everywhere.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,660
If you take the fact that 2 multiplied by itself 3 times equals 8, for example, we have

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,020
three separate ways to explain that relationship.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,480
2 cubed equals 8, with a superscript.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,140
The cube root of 8 is 2, with a squaggly radical symbol.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,160
And the log base 2 of 8 equals 3, which we write using the word log itself.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,460
What the hell do these three ways of writing the same fact have to do with each other?

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,620
Making up syntax for a concept is fine, but don't do it in three completely different

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,660
ways for the same concept and force students to learn every rule about that concept three

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
separate times.

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,100
It's like it's a different language.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,500
This way of writing things isn't just counterintuitive, it's counter-mathematical, since rather than

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,900
making seemingly different facts look the same, which is what math should do, it takes

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,280
three facts which should obviously be the same and makes them look artificially different.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,860
Just think about how confusing logarithms were the first time you learned about them.

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,640
This is, of course, a known issue, and the internet has no shortage of people raising

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,900
the same concern with suggestions for a better notation.

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,820
But recently I stumbled across a math exchange post with a suggestion so lovely, so symmetrical,

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,500
so utterly reasonable, that I just have to share it.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,740
For a relationship like 2 cubed equals 8, take a triangle and write 2 in the lower left,

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,480
3 on the top, and 8 on the lower right.

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,720
To express the operation 2 cubed, remove that bottom right corner.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,300
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,740
To express log base 2 of 8, which is asking the question 2 to the what equals 8, remove

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,040
the top number.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,500
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,380
To express the cubed root of 8, which is saying what number to the third power equals 8, remove

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,000
the bottom left corner.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,860
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,660
In other words, all three operations are completely symmetrically represented.

42
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,240
This triangle deserves a name, and a friend of mine at Khan Academy decided that we should

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,020
call it the triangle of power.

44
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,280
The definition alone is mildly pleasing, but where it gets fun is when you see how much

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,860
smoother all of the different operations become.

46
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,020
In our current notation, there are 6 different ways to express the various inverse operations.

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,560
Most of these are memorized as separate entities, some are rarely even talked about, and there's

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
no discernible pattern even though all of them describe the same basic idea.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,420
But students still have to spend 6 times the effort to memorize each one, are 6 times

50
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,640
more likely to make a mistake, and have 6 separate opportunities to decide math is dumb

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,300
and boring and conducive to failure and why don't I just go study art instead?

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,200
With the triangle of power, all these operations follow the same pattern.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,860
Our brains are really good at picking up on patterns like this, and you can much more

54
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,760
easily imagine a smooth mental image associated with the property.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,640
There's even kind of an aesthetic pleasure to this, and who knows, maybe more of the

56
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,320
artistically inclined students would look favorably upon math long enough to see just

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,020
how valuable their intuitions really are in the science.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,760
Let's take another property, like the idea that a to the x times a to the y equals a

59
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,980
to the x plus y.

60
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,620
The corresponding fact for logarithms is that log of x times y equals log of x plus log

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,620
of y.

62
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,200
When you write this with the triangle of power, it's a little easier to see that both of these

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,760
expressions are really saying the same thing.

64
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,380
Remember, the symbol as a whole represents the number at the missing corner, so the top

65
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,760
expression is saying that when you multiply two numbers that belong on the bottom right

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,000
of the triangle, it corresponds with adding the numbers that belong to the top.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,220
But that's also what the lower expression is saying.

68
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,680
When you multiply the numbers at the bottom right, it corresponds with adding numbers

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,200
that belong to the top.

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,800
To help students with this, you could draw inside of the triangle, saying that when the

71
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,480
lower left is constant, the numbers at the top like to add, while the bottom right numbers

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,780
like to multiply.

73
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,400
What about when a different corner stays constant, like the top?

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,840
Well in this case, you'd write a multiplication sign in both the bottom corners, because with

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:06,340
exponents and radicals, multiplication turns into multiplication.

76
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,200
The natural question that a student might ask from here is if there's an analogous rule

77
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
for when the lower right stays constant.

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
There is!

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,000
You have to introduce a new operation, which for the sake of this video, I'll call O+,

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,560
where aO plus b equals one over one over a plus one over b.

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,280
This is not actually a ridiculous thing to introduce, since it comes up in physics all

82
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,920
the time, like when you're computing parallel resistance.

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,040
To get that symbol, you could say that when the lower right number stays constant, the

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:53,760
top numbers like to get O-plussed together, and the bottom left numbers like to get multiplied.

85
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,040
This is actually a really nice connection between logarithms and roots, and it never

86
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,920
gets discussed, probably because the notation isn't really conducive to asking the question.

87
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,360
I could go on and on here, showing a lot of other properties, but honestly, I think

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,480
the best case I can make here is to encourage you to explore it for yourself, and notice

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,160
that just about everything involving exponents, logs, or radicals becomes nicer when you use

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,480
the triangle of power.

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,320
By the way, I hope that it goes without saying that in this perfect world, students wouldn't

92
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,700
learn these operations purely from the symbols.

93
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,180
They should still ask why it's true, and why it doesn't follow a different pattern.

94
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,620
But the point is that when the notation actually reflects the math, the questions that students

95
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,900
are most naturally asking tend to be the ones that cut right into the essence of what's

96
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,380
going on.

97
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,540
The asymmetries in the notation correspond with actual asymmetries in the numerical relationship

98
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,980
a to the b equals c itself, not in the artificial asymmetries of squiggles and words.

99
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,960
When a student asks why the top likes to get added in one context but O-plussed in another,

100
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,620
the teacher can point out the property that reflecting the triangle reciprocates the top,

101
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,020
and then they can start addressing where that fact comes from.

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,500
My sincere hope is that students don't learn by symbolic patterns, but by substantive reasoning

103
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,980
and re-derivation within their own heads.

104
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,720
But the fact is, most of us do first learn things by symbolic manipulation, so when there's

105
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,180
an opportunity to significantly speed up that process, we should take it!

106
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,800
And if you agree with me that the triangle of power is clearly better than what we have

107
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,460
already, start actually using it in your notes to see what it feels like, spread the

108
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,460
word, and if you're a teacher, maybe start teaching this to your students so that we

109
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,460
can get them hooked while they're young.
