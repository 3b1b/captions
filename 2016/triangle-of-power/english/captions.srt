1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,820
Usually, I don't think notation and math matters that much.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,363
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a bad notation rant as much as the next guy, 

3
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:12,965
and there are clearly a few simple changes to our conventions 

4
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:15,400
that could speed up learning for math students everywhere.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,160
But at the end of the day, notation, good or bad, is just not the point of math.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,967
Even the most carefully designed symbols and syntax will fail to capture the underlying 

7
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:28,961
visual that constitutes understanding, so I figure it's better to just spend time 

8
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:33,200
focusing on that underlying essence and let the symbols just be what they are in peace.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,378
But that said, when unintuitive notation actively stalls the gears of learning, 

10
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:41,120
my disposition on the matter hardens up a little bit.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,642
In particular, I'm thinking of one threesome of syntax which, 

12
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:48,568
when you stop and think about it, is an egregious source of friction in math 

13
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:49,640
education everywhere.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,102
If you take the fact that 2 multiplied by itself 3 times equals 8, 

15
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:57,720
for example, we have three separate ways to explain that relationship.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,700
2 cubed equals 8, with a superscript.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,400
The cube root of 8 is 2, with a squaggly radical symbol.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,400
And the log base 2 of 8 equals 3, which we write using the word log itself.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,320
What the hell do these three ways of writing the same fact have to do with each other?

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,773
Making up syntax for a concept is fine, but don't do it in three 

21
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:19,773
completely different ways for the same concept and force students 

22
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:22,500
to learn every rule about that concept three separate times.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,020
It's like it's a different language.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,258
This way of writing things isn't just counterintuitive, 

25
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:30,599
it's counter-mathematical, since rather than making seemingly different 

26
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,966
facts look the same, which is what math should do, 

27
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,260
it takes three facts which should obviously be the same and makes them 

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,560
look artificially different.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,540
Just think about how confusing logarithms were the first time you learned about them.

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,780
This is, of course, a known issue, and the internet has no shortage of 

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,100
people raising the same concern with suggestions for a better notation.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,446
But recently, I stumbled across a math exchange post with a suggestion so lovely, 

33
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:59,880
so symmetrical, so utterly reasonable, that I just have to share it.

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,119
For a relationship like 2 cubed equals 8, take a triangle and write 2 in the lower left, 

35
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,600
3 on the top, and 8 on the lower right.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,080
To express the operation 2 cubed, remove that bottom right corner.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,300
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,031
To express log base 2 of 8, which is asking the question 2 to the what equals 8, 

39
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,420
remove the top number.

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,080
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,865
To express the cube root of 8, which is saying what number to the third power equals 8, 

42
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,360
remove the bottom left corner.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,020
The symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in the missing corner.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,740
In other words, all three operations are completely symmetrically represented.

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,056
This triangle deserves a name, and a friend of mine at Khan 

46
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,880
Academy decided that we should call it the triangle of power.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,213
The definition alone is mildly pleasing, but where it gets fun is 

48
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:59,580
when you see how much smoother all of the different operations become.

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,030
In our current notation, there are 6 different 

50
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,360
ways to express the various inverse operations.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,134
Most of these are memorized as separate entities, some are rarely even talked about, 

52
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:14,540
and there's no discernible pattern even though all of them describe the same basic idea.

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,595
But students still have to spend 6 times the effort to memorize each one, 

54
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:22,752
are 6 times more likely to make a mistake, and have 6 separate opportunities to decide 

55
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,717
math is dumb and boring and conducive to failure and why don't I just go study art 

56
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:27,100
instead?

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,620
With the triangle of power, all these operations follow the same pattern.

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,124
Our brains are really good at picking up on patterns like this, 

59
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:41,200
and you can much more easily imagine a smooth mental image associated with the property.

60
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,415
There's even kind of an aesthetic pleasure to this, and who knows, 

61
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:49,858
maybe more of the artistically inclined students would look favorably upon 

62
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:53,760
math long enough to see just how valuable their intuitions really are in the science.

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Let's take another property, like the idea that a 

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,980
to the x times a to the y equals a to the x plus y.

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,966
The corresponding fact for logarithms is that 

66
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:08,100
log of x times y equals log of x plus log of y.

67
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,310
When you write this with the triangle of power, 

68
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,330
it's a little easier to see that both of these expressions are really 

69
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,280
saying the same thing.

70
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,492
Remember, the symbol as a whole represents the number at the missing corner, 

71
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,303
so the top expression is saying that when you multiply two numbers that belong on the 

72
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:27,025
bottom right of the triangle, it corresponds with adding the numbers that belong to 

73
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:27,380
the top.

74
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,078
But that's also what the lower expression is saying, 

75
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:32,212
when you multiply the numbers at the bottom right, 

76
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:34,640
it corresponds with adding numbers that belong to the top.

77
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,060
To help students with this, you could draw inside of the triangle, 

78
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,953
saying that when the lower left is constant, the numbers at the top like to add, 

79
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,260
while the bottom right numbers like to multiply.

80
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,200
What about when a different corner stays constant, like the top?

81
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,437
Well in this case, you'd write a multiplication sign in both the bottom corners, 

82
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:01,460
because with exponents and radicals, multiplication turns into multiplication.

83
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,912
The natural question that a student might ask from here is if 

84
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:12,120
there's an analogous rule for when the lower right stays constant.

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,560
There is!

86
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,906
You have to introduce a new operation, which for the sake of this video, 

87
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:29,800
I'll call O+, where A O plus B equals one over one over A plus one over B.

88
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,865
This is not actually a ridiculous thing to introduce, 

89
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,940
since it comes up in physics all the time, like when you're computing parallel resistance.

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,662
With that symbol, you could say that when the lower right number stays constant, 

91
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:43,998
the top numbers like to get O-plussed together, 

92
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:46,480
and the bottom left numbers like to get multiplied.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,752
This is actually a really nice connection between logarithms and roots, 

94
00:05:56,752 --> 00:06:00,757
and it never gets discussed, probably because the notation isn't really conducive to 

95
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:01,700
asking the question.

96
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,253
I could go on and on here, showing a lot of other properties, but honestly, 

97
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:11,726
I think the best case I can make here is to encourage you to explore it for yourself, 

98
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:15,107
and notice that just about everything involving exponents, logs, 

99
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:18,280
or radicals becomes nicer when you use the triangle of power.

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,167
By the way, I hope that it goes without saying that in this perfect world, 

101
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,380
students wouldn't learn these operations purely from the symbols.

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,320
They should still ask why it's true, and why it doesn't follow a different pattern.

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,984
But the point is that when the notation actually reflects the math, 

104
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:37,486
the questions that students are most naturally asking tend to be 

105
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:40,720
the ones that cut right into the essence of what's going on.

106
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,559
The asymmetries in the notation correspond with actual 

107
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:48,605
asymmetries in the numerical relationship a to the b equals c itself, 

108
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:51,900
not in the artificial asymmetries of squiggles and words.

109
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,932
When a student asks why the top likes to get added in one context but O-plussed 

110
00:06:56,932 --> 00:07:00,965
in another, the teacher can point out the property that reflecting the triangle 

111
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:05,200
reciprocates the top, and then they can start addressing where that fact comes from.

112
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,121
My sincere hope is that students don't learn by symbolic patterns, 

113
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:12,340
but by substantive reasoning and re-derivation within their own heads.

114
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,901
But the fact is, most of us do first learn things by symbolic manipulation, 

115
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:21,540
so when there's an opportunity to significantly speed up that process, we should take it!

116
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,846
And if you agree with me that the triangle of power is clearly better than what 

117
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:29,700
we have already, start actually using it in your notes to see what it feels like.

118
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,700
Spread the word!

119
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,340
And, if you're a teacher, maybe start teaching this to your 

120
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,580
students so that we can get them hooked while they're young.
