1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,115
Last video I talked about the dot product, showing both the standard introduction 

2
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:17,260
to the topic, as well as a deeper view of how it relates to linear transformations.

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,141
I'd like to do the same thing for cross products, 

4
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:24,564
which also have a standard introduction, along with a deeper understanding 

5
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:27,987
in the light of linear transformations, but this time I'm dividing it into 

6
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:28,900
two separate videos.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,129
Here, I'll try to hit the main points that students are usually shown 

8
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:36,738
about the cross product, and in the next video I'll be showing a view 

9
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:40,400
which is less commonly taught, but really satisfying when you learn it.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,860
We'll start in two dimensions.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,380
If you have two vectors, v and w, think about the parallelogram that they span out.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,078
What I mean by that is that if you take a copy of v and move its tail to the tip of w, 

13
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:56,622
and you take a copy of w and move its tail to the tip of v, 

14
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:00,580
the four vectors now on the screen enclose a certain parallelogram.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,877
The cross product of v and w, written with the x-shaped multiplication symbol, 

16
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:08,960
is the area of this parallelogram.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,680
Well, almost.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,400
We also need to consider orientation.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,327
Basically, if v is on the right of w, then v cross w 

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,780
is positive and equal to the area of the parallelogram.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,246
But if v is on the left of w, then the cross product is negative, 

22
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,900
namely the negative area of that parallelogram.

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,620
Notice this means that order matters.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,928
If you swapped v and w, instead taking w cross v, 

25
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:37,860
the cross product would become the negative of whatever it was before.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,340
The way I always remember the ordering here is that when you take the cross product 

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,640
of the two basis vectors in order, i-hat cross j-hat, the result should be positive.

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,000
In fact, the order of your basis vectors is what defines orientation.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,190
So since i-hat is on the right of j-hat, I remember that v 

30
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,900
cross w has to be positive whenever v is on the right of w.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,414
So for example, with the vectors shown here, I'll just 

32
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:07,040
tell you that the area of that parallelogram is seven.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,340
And since v is on the left of w, the cross product should be negative.

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,860
So v cross w is negative seven.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
But of course, you want to be able to compute this without someone telling you the area.

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,580
This is where the determinant comes in.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,322
So if you didn't see chapter five of this series, 

38
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:29,180
where I talk about the determinant, now would be a really good time to go take a look.

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,549
Even if you did see it, but it was a while ago, 

40
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,120
I'd recommend taking another look just to make sure those ideas are fresh in your mind.

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,396
For the 2D cross product, v cross w, what you do is you write the coordinates 

42
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:45,325
of v as the first column of a matrix, and you take the coordinates of w 

43
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:49,200
and make them the second column, then you just compute the determinant.

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,284
This is because a matrix whose columns represent v and w corresponds with a 

45
00:02:56,284 --> 00:03:01,380
linear transformation that moves the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat to v and w.

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,129
The determinant is all about measuring how areas change due to a transformation, 

47
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:16,420
and the prototypical area that we look at is the unit square resting on i-hat and j-hat.

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,764
After the transformation, that square gets turned 

49
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,020
into the parallelogram that we care about.

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,892
So the determinant, which generally measures the factor by which areas are changed, 

51
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:31,503
gives the area of this parallelogram, since it evolved from a square that started with 

52
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:31,980
area one.

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,282
What's more, if v is on the left of w, it means that orientation was flipped during 

54
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:41,460
that transformation, which is what it means for the determinant to be negative.

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,300
As an example, let's say v has coordinates negative 3, 1, and w has coordinates 2, 1.

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,152
The determinant of the matrix with those coordinates as columns 

57
00:03:56,152 --> 00:04:00,920
is negative 3 times 1 minus 2 times 1, which is negative 5.

58
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,093
So evidently, the area of the parallelogram they define is 5, 

59
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:09,740
and since v is on the left of w, it should make sense that this value is negative.

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,730
As with any new operation you learn, I'd recommend playing 

61
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,305
around with this notion a bit in your head, just to get kind 

62
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,880
of an intuitive feel for what the cross product is all about.

63
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,340
For example, you might notice that when two vectors are perpendicular, 

64
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,245
or at least close to being perpendicular, their cross product is larger than 

65
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:30,390
it would be if they were pointing in very similar directions, 

66
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,345
because the area of that parallelogram is larger when the sides are closer to 

67
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,360
being perpendicular.

68
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,284
Something else you might notice is that if you were to scale up one of those vectors, 

69
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:46,082
perhaps multiplying v by 3, then the area of that parallelogram 

70
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:48,160
is also scaled up by a factor of 3.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,591
So what this means for the operation is that 3v 

72
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:56,660
cross w will be exactly 3 times the value of v cross w.

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,949
Now, even though all of this is a perfectly fine mathematical operation, 

74
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,060
what I just described is technically not the cross product.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,791
The true cross product is something that combines 

76
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,740
two different 3d vectors to get a new 3d vector.

77
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,812
Just as before, we're still going to consider the parallelogram 

78
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:18,620
defined by the two vectors that we're crossing together, 

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,020
and the area of this parallelogram is still going to play a big role.

80
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,800
To be concrete, let's say that the area is 2.5 for the vectors shown here.

81
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,260
But as I said, the cross product is not a number, it's a vector.

82
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,803
This new vector's length will be the area of that parallelogram, 

83
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:39,693
which in this case is 2.5, and the direction of that new vector is going to be 

84
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,860
perpendicular to the parallelogram.

85
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,780
But which way, right?

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,807
I mean, there are two possible vectors with length 

87
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:49,160
2.5 that are perpendicular to a given plane.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
This is where the right hand rule comes in.

89
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,154
Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of v, 

90
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,940
then stick out your middle finger in the direction of w.

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Then, when you point up your thumb, that's the direction of the cross product.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,713
For example, let's say that v was a vector with length 2 pointing straight up in 

93
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:17,120
the z direction, and w is a vector with length 2 pointing in the pure y direction.

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,811
The parallelogram that they define in this simple example is actually a square, 

95
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:26,000
since they're perpendicular and have the same length, and the area of that square is 4.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
So their cross product should be a vector with length 4.

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,820
Using the right hand rule, their cross product should point in the negative x direction.

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,680
So the cross product of these two vectors is negative 4 times i-hat.

99
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,964
For more general computations, there is a formula that you could memorize if you wanted, 

100
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:52,823
but it's common and easier to instead remember a certain 

101
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,680
process involving the 3D determinant.

102
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,520
Now, this process looks truly strange at first.

103
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,979
You write down a 3D matrix where the second and 

104
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,940
third columns contain the coordinates of v and w.

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,480
But for that first column, you write the basis vectors i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat.

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,340
Then you compute the determinant of this matrix.

107
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,940
The silliness is probably clear here.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,780
What on earth does it mean to put in a vector as the entry of a matrix?

109
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,140
Students are often told that this is just a notational trick.

110
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,791
When you carry out the computations as if i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat were numbers, 

111
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,980
then you get some linear combination of those basis vectors.

112
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,657
And the vector defined by that linear combination, students are told to just believe, 

113
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:43,235
is the unique vector perpendicular to v and w, 

114
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:46,636
whose magnitude is the area of the appropriate parallelogram, 

115
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,160
and whose direction obeys the right hand rule.

116
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,733
And sure, in some sense this is just a notational trick, 

117
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,780
but there is a reason for doing it.

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,160
It's not just a coincidence that the determinant is once again important.

119
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,560
And putting the basis vectors in those slots is not just a random thing to do.

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,013
To understand where all of this comes from, it helps to 

121
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,900
use the idea of duality that I introduced in the last video.

122
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,877
This concept is a little bit heavy though, so I'm putting it in a 

123
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:19,120
separate follow-on video for any of you who are curious to learn more.

124
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,920
Arguably, it falls outside the essence of linear algebra.

125
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,612
The important part here is to know what that cross 

126
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:27,300
product vector geometrically represents.

127
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,040
So if you want to skip that next video, feel free.

128
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,039
But for those of you who are willing to go a bit deeper, 

129
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,707
and who are curious about the connection between this computation and the underlying 

130
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:40,030
geometry, the ideas that I'll talk about in the next video are just a really 

131
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,980
elegant piece of math.
