00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,320
Last video I talked about the dot product, showing both the standard introduction to

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,260
the topic, as well as a deeper view of how it relates to linear transformations.

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,400
I'd like to do the same thing for cross products, which also have a standard introduction,

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,280
along with a deeper understanding in the light of linear transformations, but this time I'm

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,900
dividing it into two separate videos.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,400
Here, I'll try to hit the main points that students are usually shown about the cross

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,440
product, and in the next video I'll be showing a view which is less commonly taught, but

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,400
really satisfying when you learn it.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,860
We'll start in two dimensions.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,380
If you have two vectors, v and w, think about the parallelogram that they span out.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,560
What I mean by that is that if you take a copy of v and move its tail to the tip of

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,040
w, and you take a copy of w and move its tail to the tip of v, the four vectors now on the

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,580
screen enclose a certain parallelogram.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,340
The cross product of v and w, written with the x-shaped multiplication symbol, is the

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,960
area of this parallelogram.

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,680
Well, almost.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,400
We also need to consider orientation.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,720
Basically, if v is on the right of w, then v cross w is positive and equal to the area

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,780
of the parallelogram.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,800
But if v is on the left of w, then the cross product is negative, namely the negative area

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,900
of that parallelogram.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,620
Notice this means that order matters.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,480
If you swapped v and w, instead taking w cross v, the cross product would become the negative

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,860
of whatever it was before.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
The way I always remember the ordering here is that when you take the cross product of

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,640
the two basis vectors in order, i-hat cross j-hat, the result should be positive.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,000
In fact, the order of your basis vectors is what defines orientation.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,920
So since i-hat is on the right of j-hat, I remember that v cross w has to be positive

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,900
whenever v is on the right of w.

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,820
So for example, with the vectors shown here, I'll just tell you that the area of that

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,040
parallelogram is seven.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,340
And since v is on the left of w, the cross product should be negative.

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,860
So v cross w is negative seven.

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
But of course, you want to be able to compute this without someone telling you the area.

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,580
This is where the determinant comes in.

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,620
So if you didn't see chapter five of this series, where I talk about the determinant,

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,180
now would be a really good time to go take a look.

38
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,280
Even if you did see it, but it was a while ago, I'd recommend taking another look just

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
to make sure those ideas are fresh in your mind.

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,600
For the 2D cross product, v cross w, what you do is you write the coordinates of v as

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,800
the first column of a matrix, and you take the coordinates of w and make them the second

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
column, then you just compute the determinant.

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,880
This is because a matrix whose columns represent v and w corresponds with a linear transformation

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,380
that moves the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat to v and w.

45
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,540
The determinant is all about measuring how areas change due to a transformation, and

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,420
the prototypical area that we look at is the unit square resting on i-hat and j-hat.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,480
After the transformation, that square gets turned into the parallelogram that we care

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,020
about.

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,000
So the determinant, which generally measures the factor by which areas are changed, gives

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,980
the area of this parallelogram, since it evolved from a square that started with area one.

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,800
What's more, if v is on the left of w, it means that orientation was flipped during

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,460
that transformation, which is what it means for the determinant to be negative.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,300
As an example, let's say v has coordinates negative 3, 1, and w has coordinates 2, 1.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,420
The determinant of the matrix with those coordinates as columns is negative 3 times 1 minus 2 times

55
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,920
1, which is negative 5.

56
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,020
So evidently, the area of the parallelogram they define is 5, and since v is on the left

57
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,740
of w, it should make sense that this value is negative.

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,500
As with any new operation you learn, I'd recommend playing around with this notion a bit in your

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,880
head, just to get kind of an intuitive feel for what the cross product is all about.

60
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,640
For example, you might notice that when two vectors are perpendicular, or at least close

61
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,140
to being perpendicular, their cross product is larger than it would be if they were pointing

62
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,940
in very similar directions, because the area of that parallelogram is larger when the sides

63
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,360
are closer to being perpendicular.

64
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,680
Something else you might notice is that if you were to scale up one of those vectors,

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,320
perhaps multiplying v by 3, then the area of that parallelogram is also scaled up by

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
a factor of 3.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,420
So what this means for the operation is that 3v cross w will be exactly 3 times the value

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,660
of v cross w.

69
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,900
Now, even though all of this is a perfectly fine mathematical operation, what I just described

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,060
is technically not the cross product.

71
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,740
The true cross product is something that combines two different 3d vectors to get a new 3d vector.

72
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,040
Just as before, we're still going to consider the parallelogram defined by the two vectors

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,460
that we're crossing together, and the area of this parallelogram is still going to play

74
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,020
a big role.

75
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,800
To be concrete, let's say that the area is 2.5 for the vectors shown here.

76
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,260
But as I said, the cross product is not a number, it's a vector.

77
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,460
This new vector's length will be the area of that parallelogram, which in this case

78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,860
is 2.5, and the direction of that new vector is going to be perpendicular to the parallelogram.

79
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,780
But which way, right?

80
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,780
I mean, there are two possible vectors with length 2.5 that are perpendicular to a given

81
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,160
plane.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
This is where the right hand rule comes in.

83
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,400
Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of v, then stick out your middle

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,940
finger in the direction of w.

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Then, when you point up your thumb, that's the direction of the cross product.

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,480
For example, let's say that v was a vector with length 2 pointing straight up in the

87
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,120
z direction, and w is a vector with length 2 pointing in the pure y direction.

88
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,000
The parallelogram that they define in this simple example is actually a square, since

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
they're perpendicular and have the same length, and the area of that square is 4.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
So their cross product should be a vector with length 4.

91
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,820
Using the right hand rule, their cross product should point in the negative x direction.

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,680
So the cross product of these two vectors is negative 4 times i-hat.

93
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,940
For more general computations, there is a formula that you could memorize if you wanted,

94
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,680
but it's common and easier to instead remember a certain process involving the 3D determinant.

95
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,520
Now, this process looks truly strange at first.

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,700
You write down a 3D matrix where the second and third columns contain the coordinates

97
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,940
of v and w.

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,480
But for that first column, you write the basis vectors i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat.

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,340
Then you compute the determinant of this matrix.

100
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,940
The silliness is probably clear here.

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,780
What on earth does it mean to put in a vector as the entry of a matrix?

102
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,140
Students are often told that this is just a notational trick.

103
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,700
When you carry out the computations as if i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat were numbers,

104
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,980
then you get some linear combination of those basis vectors.

105
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,500
And the vector defined by that linear combination, students are told to just believe,

106
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,040
is the unique vector perpendicular to v and w, whose magnitude is the area of the appropriate

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,160
parallelogram, and whose direction obeys the right hand rule.

108
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,780
And sure, in some sense this is just a notational trick, but there is a reason for doing it.

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,160
It's not just a coincidence that the determinant is once again important.

110
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,560
And putting the basis vectors in those slots is not just a random thing to do.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,360
To understand where all of this comes from, it helps to use the idea of duality

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,900
that I introduced in the last video.

113
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,020
This concept is a little bit heavy though, so I'm putting it in a separate follow-on video

114
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,120
for any of you who are curious to learn more.

115
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,920
Arguably, it falls outside the essence of linear algebra.

116
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,300
The important part here is to know what that cross product vector geometrically represents.

117
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,040
So if you want to skip that next video, feel free.

118
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,520
But for those of you who are willing to go a bit deeper,

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,660
and who are curious about the connection between this computation and the underlying geometry,

120
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,200
the ideas that I'll talk about in the next video are just a really elegant piece of math.
