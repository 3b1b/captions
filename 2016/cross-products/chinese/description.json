  "input": "*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result, since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.",
  "translatedText": "*注意，在此处的所有计算中，我将向量的坐标列为矩阵的列，但许多教科书将它们放在矩阵的行中。这对结果没有影响，因为行列式在转置后没有改变，但考虑到我如何构建本系列的大部分内容，我认为采用以列为中心的方法更直观。",
