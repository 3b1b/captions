00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:13,280
Last video I talked about the dot product, showing both the standard introduction to

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,920
the topic, as well as a deeper view of how it relates to linear transformations.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,760
I'd like to do the same thing for cross products, which also have a standard introduction,

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,520
along with a deeper understanding in the light of linear transformations, but this time I'm

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,960
dividing it into two separate videos.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,320
Here I'll try to hit the main points that students are usually shown about the cross

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,560
product, and in the next video I'll be showing a view which is less commonly taught, but

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,880
really satisfying when you learn it.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,440
We'll start in two dimensions.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,020
If you have two vectors, v and w, think about the parallelogram that they span out.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,520
What I mean by that is that if you take a copy of v and move its tail to the tip of

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,960
w, and you take a copy of w and move its tail to the tip of v, the four vectors now on the

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,080
screen enclose a certain parallelogram.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,280
The cross product of v and w, written with the x-shaped multiplication symbol, is the

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
area of this parallelogram.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,360
Well almost, we also need to consider orientation.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,720
Basically if v is on the right of w, then v cross w is positive and equal to the area

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,680
of the parallelogram.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,780
But if v is on the left of w, then the cross product is negative, namely the negative area

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,700
of that parallelogram.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,220
Notice this means that order matters.

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,620
If you swapped v and w, instead taking w cross v, the cross product would become the negative

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,100
of whatever it was before.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,740
The way I always remember the ordering here is that when you take the cross product of

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,320
the two basis vectors in order, i-hat cross j-hat, the result should be positive.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,880
In fact, the order of your basis vectors is what defines orientation.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,960
So since i-hat is on the right of j-hat, I remember that v cross w has to be positive

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,840
whenever v is on the right of w.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,760
So for example, with the vectors shown here, I'll just tell you that the area of that

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,880
parallelogram is 7.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,100
And since v is on the left of w, the cross product should be negative, so v cross w is

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,120
negative 7.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,800
But of course, you want to be able to compute this without someone telling you the area.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
This is where the determinant comes in.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,320
So if you didn't see chapter 5 of this series, where I talk about the determinant, now would

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,840
be a really good time to go take a look.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,300
Even if you did see it, but it was a while ago, I'd recommend taking another look just

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,500
to make sure those ideas are fresh in your mind.

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,560
For the 2D cross product, v cross w, what you do is you write the coordinates of v as

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,160
the first column of a matrix, and you take the coordinates of w and make them the second

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,560
column, then you just compute the determinant.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,280
This is because a matrix whose columns represent v and w corresponds with a linear transformation

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:06,760
that moves the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat to v and w.

44
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,520
The determinant is all about measuring how areas change due to a transformation, and

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,320
the prototypical area that we look at is the unit square resting on i-hat and j-hat.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,520
After the transformation, that square gets turned into the parallelogram that we care

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
about.

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,960
So the determinant, which generally measures the factor by which areas are changed, gives

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,920
the area of this parallelogram, since it evolved from a square that started with area 1.

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,800
What's more, if v is on the left of w, it means that orientation was flipped during

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,360
that transformation, which is what it means for the determinant to be negative.

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,100
As an example, let's say v has coordinates negative 3, 1, and w has coordinates 2, 1.

53
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,640
The determinant of the matrix with those coordinates as columns is negative 3 times 1 minus 2 times

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,680
1, which is negative 5.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,060
So evidently, the area of the parallelogram they define is 5, and since v is on the left

56
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,420
of w, it should make sense that this value is negative.

57
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,420
As with any new operation you learn, I'd recommend playing around with this notion a bit in your

58
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,860
head, just to get kind of an intuitive feel for what the cross product is all about.

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,640
For example, you might notice that when two vectors are perpendicular, or at least close

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,180
to being perpendicular, their cross product is larger than it would be if they were pointing

61
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,980
in very similar directions, because the area of that parallelogram is larger when the sides

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,420
are closer to being perpendicular.

63
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,180
Something else you might notice is that if you were to scale up one of those vectors,

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,260
perhaps multiplying v by 3, then the area of that parallelogram is also scaled up by

65
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,140
a factor of 3.

66
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,620
So what this means for the operation is that 3v cross w will be exactly 3 times the value

67
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,300
of v cross w.

68
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,020
Now even though all of this is a perfectly fine mathematical operation, what I just described

69
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,780
is technically not the cross product.

70
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,780
The true cross product is something that combines two different 3d vectors to get a new 3d vector.

71
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,060
Just as before, we're still going to consider the parallelogram defined by the two vectors

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,440
that we're crossing together, and the area of this parallelogram is still going to play

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
a big role.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,320
To be concrete, let's say that the area is 2.5 for the vectors shown here.

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,240
But as I said, the cross product is not a number, it's a vector.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,440
This new vector's length will be the area of that parallelogram, which in this case

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,220
is 2.5.

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,760
And the direction of that new vector is going to be perpendicular to the parallelogram.

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
But which way, right?

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,880
I mean, there are two possible vectors with length 2.5 that are perpendicular to a given

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,760
plane.

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,980
This is where the right hand rule comes in.

83
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,400
Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of v, then stick out your middle

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,760
finger in the direction of w.

85
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Then, when you point up your thumb, that's the direction of the cross product.

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,400
For example, let's say that v was a vector with length 2 pointing straight up in the

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,040
z direction, and w is a vector with length 2 pointing in the pure y direction.

88
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,120
The parallelogram that they define in this simple example is actually a square, since

89
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,280
they're perpendicular and have the same length.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,640
And the area of that square is 4.

91
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,160
So their cross product should be a vector with length 4.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,280
Using the right hand rule, their cross product should point in the negative x direction.

93
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,160
So the cross product of these two vectors is negative 4 times i-hat.

94
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,200
For more general computations, there is a formula that you could memorize if you wanted,

95
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,560
but it's common and easier to instead remember a certain process involving the 3D determinant.

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,080
Now, this process looks truly strange at first.

97
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,840
You write down a 3D matrix where the second and third columns contain the coordinates

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,480
of v and w.

99
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,760
But for that first column, you write the basis vectors i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat.

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,340
Then you compute the determinant of this matrix.

101
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,480
The silliness is probably clear here.

102
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,720
What on earth does it mean to put in a vector as the entry of a matrix?

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Students are often told that this is just a notational trick.

104
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,240
When you carry out the computations as if i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat were numbers,

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,320
then you get some linear combination of those basis vectors.

106
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,080
And the vector defined by that linear combination, students are told to just believe,

107
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,000
is the unique vector perpendicular to v and w, whose magnitude is the area of the appropriate

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,720
parallelogram and whose direction obeys the right hand rule.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
And sure, in some sense this is just a notational trick, but there is a reason for doing it.

110
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,720
It's not just a coincidence that the determinant is once again important.

111
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,720
And putting the basis vectors in those slots is not just a random thing to do.

112
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,720
To understand where all of this comes from, it helps to use the idea of duality that I introduced in the last video.

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
This concept is a little bit heavy though, so I'm putting it in a separate follow-on video

114
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
for any of you who are curious to learn more.

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Arguably, it falls outside the essence of linear algebra.

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
The important part here is to know what that cross product vector geometrically represents.

117
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
So if you want to skip that next video, feel free.

118
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,720
But for those of you who are willing to go a bit deeper, and who are curious about the connection

119
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
between this computation and the underlying geometry,

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,720
the ideas that I'll talk about in the next video are just a really elegant piece of math.
