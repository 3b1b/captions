1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:11,440
The Riemann zeta function. This is one of those objects in modern math that a lot of you might have heard of, but which can be really difficult to understand.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,180
Don't worry, I'll explain that animation that you just saw in a few minutes.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:24,960
A lot of people know about this function because there's a one million dollar prize out for anyone who can figure out when it equals zero, an open problem known as the Riemann hypothesis.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,560
Some of you may have heard of it in the context of the divergent sum 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on up to infinity.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,180
You see, there's a sense in which this sum equals negative 1 twelfth, which seems nonsensical if not obviously wrong.

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,920
But a common way to define what this equation is actually saying uses the Riemann zeta function.

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:57,380
But as any casual math enthusiast who started to read into this knows, its definition references this one idea called analytic continuation, which has to do with complex valued functions.

8
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,520
And this idea can be frustratingly opaque and unintuitive.

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:11,880
So what I'd like to do here is just show you all what this zeta function actually looks like, and to explain what this idea of analytic continuation is in a visual and more intuitive way.

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm assuming that you know about complex numbers, and that you're comfortable working with them.

11
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:28,260
And I'm tempted to say that you should know calculus, since analytic continuation is all about derivatives, but for the way I'm planning to present things I think you might actually be fine without that.

12
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,800
So to jump right into it, let's just define what this zeta function is.

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:48,780
For a given input, where we commonly use the variable s, the function is 1 over 1 to the s, which is always 1, plus 1 over 2 to the s, plus 1 over 3 to the s, plus 1 over 4 to the s, on and on and on, summing up over all natural numbers.

14
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,080
So for example, let's say you plug in a value like s equals 2.

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:08,980
You'd get 1 plus 1 over 4 plus 1 over 9 plus 1 sixteenth, and as you keep adding more and more reciprocals of squares, this just so happens to approach pi squared over 6, which is around 1.645.

16
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:17,800
There's a very beautiful reason for why pi shows up here, and I might do a video on it at a later date, but that's just the tip of the iceberg for why this function is beautiful.

17
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,480
You could do the same thing for other inputs s, like 3 or 4, and sometimes you get other interesting values.

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,640
And so far, everything feels pretty reasonable. You're adding up smaller and smaller amounts, and these sums approach some number.

19
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,800
Great, no craziness here.

20
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,500
Yet, if you were to read about it, you might see some people say that zeta of negative 1 equals negative 1 twelfth.

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
But looking at this infinite sum, that doesn't make any sense.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:55,160
When you raise each term to the negative 1, flipping each fraction, you get 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on over all natural numbers.

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,760
And obviously that doesn't approach anything, certainly not negative 1 twelfth, right?

24
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:08,820
And, as any mercenary looking into the Riemann hypothesis knows, this function is said to have trivial zeros at negative even numbers.

25
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,760
So for example, that would mean that zeta of negative 2 equals 0.

26
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:23,700
But when you plug in negative 2, it gives you 1 plus 4 plus 9 plus 16 on and on, which again obviously doesn't approach anything, much less 0, right?

27
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,620
Well, we'll get to negative values in a few minutes, but for right now, let's just say the only thing that seems reasonable.

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,220
This function only makes sense when s is greater than 1, which is when this sum converges.

29
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,760
So far, it's simply not defined for other values.

30
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:49,820
Now, with that said, Bernard Riemann was somewhat of a father to complex analysis, which is the study of functions that have complex numbers as inputs and outputs.

31
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,100
So rather than just thinking about how this sum takes a number s on the real number line to another number on the real number line,

32
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,240
his main focus was on understanding what happens when you plug in a complex value for s.

33
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,460
So for example, maybe instead of plugging in 2, you would plug in 2 plus i.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,340
Now, if you've never seen the idea of raising a number to the power of a complex value, it can feel kind of strange at first,

35
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,740
because it no longer has anything to do with repeated multiplication.

36
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:30,940
But mathematicians found that there is a very nice and very natural way to extend the definition of exponents beyond their familiar territory of real numbers and into the realm of complex values.

37
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:40,880
It's not super crucial to understand complex exponents for where I'm going with this video, but I think it'll still be nice if we just summarize the gist of it here.

38
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:51,300
The basic idea is that when you write something like 1 half to the power of a complex number, you split it up as 1 half to the real part times 1 half to the pure imaginary part.

39
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,260
We're good on 1 half to the real part, there's no issues there.

40
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,600
But what about raising something to a pure imaginary number?

41
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,460
Well, the result is going to be some complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane.

42
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:17,300
As you let that pure imaginary input walk up and down the imaginary line, the resulting output walks around that unit circle.

43
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,900
For a base like 1 half, the output walks around the unit circle somewhat slowly.

44
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:38,220
But for a base that's farther away from 1, like 1 ninth, then as you let this input walk up and down the imaginary axis, the corresponding output is going to walk around the unit circle more quickly.

45
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,660
If you've never seen this and you're wondering why on earth this happens, I've left a few links to good resources in the description.

46
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,020
For here, I'm just going to move forward with the what without the why.

47
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:57,260
The main takeaway is that when you raise something like 1 half to the power of 2 plus i, which is 1 half squared times 1 half to the i,

48
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,820
that 1 half to the i part is going to be on the unit circle, meaning it has an absolute value of 1.

49
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,060
So when you multiply it, it doesn't change the size of the number, it just takes that 1 fourth and rotates it somewhat.

50
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:24,100
So, if you were to plug in 2 plus i to the zeta function, one way to think about what it does is to start off with all of the terms raised to the power of 2,

51
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:33,540
which you can think of as piecing together lines whose lengths are the reciprocals of squares of numbers, which, like I said before, converges to pi squared over 6.

52
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,340
Then when you change that input from 2 up to 2 plus i, each of these lines gets rotated by some amount.

53
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:49,580
But importantly, the lengths of those lines won't change, so the sum still converges, it just does so in a spiral to some specific point on the complex plane.

54
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,480
Here, let me show what it looks like when I vary the input s, represented with this yellow dot on the complex plane,

55
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,340
where this spiral sum is always going to be showing the converging value for zeta of s.

56
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:23,320
What this means is that zeta of s, defined as this infinite sum, is a perfectly reasonable complex function as long as the real part of the input is greater than 1,

57
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,300
meaning the input s sits somewhere on this right half of the complex plane.

58
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,460
Again, this is because it's the real part of s that determines the size of each number, while the imaginary part just dictates some rotation.

59
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,360
So now what I want to do is visualize this function.

60
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:49,020
It takes in inputs on the right half of the complex plane and spits out outputs somewhere else in the complex plane.

61
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,660
A super nice way to understand complex functions is to visualize them as transformations,

62
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,900
meaning you look at every possible input to the function and just let it move over to the corresponding output.

63
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,180
For example, let's take a moment and try to visualize something a little bit easier than the zeta function.

64
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,820
Say f of s is equal to s squared.

65
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,160
When you plug in s equals 2, you get 4, so we'll end up moving that point at 2 over to the point at 4.

66
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,100
When you plug in negative 1, you get 1, so the point over here at negative 1 is going to end up moving over to the point at 1.

67
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,380
When you plug in i, by definition its square is negative 1, so it's going to move over here to negative 1.

68
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,720
Now I'm going to add on a more colorful grid, and this is just because things are about to start moving,

69
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,260
and it's kind of nice to have something to distinguish grid lines during that movement.

70
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:49,520
From here, I'll tell the computer to move every single point on this grid over to its corresponding output under the function f of s equals s squared.

71
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,340
Here's what it looks like.

72
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,260
That can be a lot to take in, so I'll go ahead and play it again.

73
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,880
And this time, focus on one of the marked points, and notice how it moves over to the point corresponding to its square.

74
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,660
It can be a little complicated to see all of the points moving all at once,

75
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,160
but the reward is that this gives us a very rich picture for what the complex function is actually doing,

76
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,180
and it all happens in just two dimensions.

77
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,800
So, back to the zeta function.

78
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,800
We have this infinite sum, which is a function of some complex number s,

79
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,800
and we feel good and happy about plugging in values of s whose real part is greater than 1,

80
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,760
and getting some meaningful output via the converging spiral sum.

81
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,460
So to visualize this function, I'm going to take the portion of the grid sitting on the right side of the complex plane here,

82
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,020
where the real part of numbers is greater than 1,

83
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,460
and I'm going to tell the computer to move each point of this grid to the appropriate output.

84
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,720
It actually helps if I add a few more grid lines around the number 1, since that region gets stretched out by quite a bit.

85
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,580
Alright, so first of all, let's all just appreciate how beautiful that is.

86
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,960
I mean, damn, if that doesn't make you want to learn more about complex functions, you have no heart.

87
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,700
But also, this transformed grid is just begging to be extended a little bit.

88
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,600
For example, let's highlight these lines here, which represent all of the complex numbers with imaginary part i, or negative i.

89
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,280
After the transformation, these lines make such lovely arcs before they just abruptly stop.

90
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,760
Don't you want to just, you know, continue those arcs?

91
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,700
In fact, you can imagine how some altered version of the function, with a definition that extends into this left half of the plane,

92
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,280
might be able to complete this picture with something that's quite pretty.

93
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,360
Well, this is exactly what mathematicians working with complex functions do.

94
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,280
They continue the function beyond the original domain where it was defined.

95
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,160
Now, as soon as we branch over into inputs where the real part is less than 1,

96
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,140
this infinite sum that we originally used to define the function doesn't make sense anymore.

97
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,560
You'll get nonsense, like adding 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on up to infinity.

98
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,300
But just looking at this transformed version of the right half of the plane, where the sum does make sense,

99
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,840
it's just begging us to extend the set of points that we're considering as inputs.

100
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,020
Even if that means defining the extended function in some way that doesn't necessarily use that sum.

101
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,280
Of course, that leaves us with the question, how would you define that function on the rest of the plane?

102
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,680
You might think that you could extend it any number of ways.

103
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,760
Maybe you define an extension that makes it so the point at, say, s equals negative 1 moves over to negative 1 twelfth.

104
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,280
But maybe you squiggle on some extension that makes it land on any other value.

105
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:59,080
I mean, as soon as you open yourself up to the idea of defining the function differently for values outside that domain of convergence,

106
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,260
that is, not based on this infinite sum, the world is your oyster, and you can have any number of extensions, right?

107
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,980
Well, not exactly. I mean, yes, you can give any child a marker and have them extend these lines any which way,

108
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,900
but if you add on the restriction that this new extended function has to have a derivative everywhere,

109
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,820
it locks us into one and only one possible extension.

110
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,700
I know, I know, I said that you wouldn't need to know about derivatives for this video,

111
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,100
and even if you do know calculus, maybe you have yet to learn how to interpret derivatives for complex functions.

112
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,760
But luckily for us, there is a very nice geometric intuition that you can keep in mind for when I say a phrase like,

113
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,240
has a derivative everywhere.

114
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,220
Here, to show you what I mean, let's look back at that f of s equals s squared example.

115
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:54,960
Again, we think of this function as a transformation, moving every point s of the complex plane over to the point s squared.

116
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,900
For those of you who know calculus, you know that you can take the derivative of this function at any given input,

117
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,500
but there's an interesting property of that transformation that turns out to be related and almost equivalent to that fact.

118
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,640
If you look at any two lines in the input space that intersect at some angle,

119
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,480
and consider what they turn into after the transformation, they will still intersect each other at that same angle.

120
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:27,660
The lines might get curved, and that's okay, but the important part is that the angle at which they intersect remains unchanged,

121
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,080
and this is true for any pair of lines that you choose.

122
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,460
So when I say a function has a derivative everywhere, I want you to think about this angle-preserving property,

123
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,740
that any time two lines intersect, the angle between them remains unchanged after the transformation.

124
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,980
At a glance, this is easiest to appreciate by noticing how all of the curves that the grid lines turn into still intersect each other at right angles.

125
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:05,820
Complex functions that have a derivative everywhere are called analytic, so you can think of this term analytic as meaning angle-preserving.

126
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,980
Admittedly, I'm lying to you a little here, but only a little bit.

127
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,800
A slight caveat for those of you who want the full details is that at inputs where the derivative of a function is zero,

128
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,420
instead of angles being preserved, they get multiplied by some integer.

129
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,780
But those points are by far the minority, and for almost all inputs to an analytic function, angles are preserved.

130
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,440
So if when I say analytic, you think angle-preserving, I think that's a fine intuition to have.

131
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,920
Now, if you think about it for a moment, and this is a point that I really want you to appreciate,

132
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:50,680
this is a very restrictive property. The angle between any pair of intersecting lines has to remain unchanged.

133
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,780
And yet, pretty much any function out there that has a name turns out to be analytic.

134
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,880
The field of complex analysis, which Riemann helped to establish in its modern form,

135
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,680
is almost entirely about leveraging the properties of analytic functions to understand results and patterns in other fields of math and science.

136
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,540
The zeta function, defined by this infinite sum on the right half of the plane, is an analytic function.

137
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,620
Notice how all of these curves that the grid lines turn into still intersect each other at right angles.

138
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:36,520
So the surprising fact about complex functions is that if you want to extend an analytic function beyond the domain where it was originally defined,

139
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,100
for example, extending this zeta function into the left half of the plane,

140
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:48,100
then if you require that the new extended function still be analytic, that is, that it still preserves angles everywhere,

141
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,960
it forces you into only one possible extension, if one exists at all.

142
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,560
It's kind of like an infinite continuous jigsaw puzzle,

143
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,700
where this requirement of preserving angles locks you into one and only one choice for how to extend it.

144
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:11,060
This process of extending an analytic function in the only way possible that's still analytic is called, as you may have guessed,

145
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,560
analytic continuation.

146
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,720
So that's how the full Riemann zeta function is defined.

147
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,100
For values of s on the right half of the plane, where the real part is greater than 1,

148
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,220
we can plug them into this sum and see where it converges.

149
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,740
And that convergence might look like some kind of spiral, since raising each of these terms to a complex power has the effect of rotating each one.

150
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:41,180
Then for the rest of the plane, we know that there exists one and only one way to extend this definition so that the function will still be analytic,

151
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,540
that is, so that it still preserves angles at every single point.

152
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:52,140
So we just say that by definition, the zeta function on the left half of the plane is whatever that extension happens to be.

153
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,260
And that's a valid definition because there's only one possible analytic continuation.

154
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,900
Notice, that's a very implicit definition.

155
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,360
It just says, use the solution of this jigsaw puzzle, which through more abstract derivation we know must exist,

156
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,620
but it doesn't specify exactly how to solve it.

157
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,440
Mathematicians have a pretty good grasp on what this extension looks like,

158
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,820
but some important parts of it remain a mystery.

159
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,940
A million dollar mystery, in fact.

160
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,320
Let's actually take a moment and talk about the Riemann hypothesis,

161
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,860
which is a million dollar problem.

162
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,300
The places where this function equals zero turn out to be quite important,

163
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,280
that is, which points get mapped onto the origin after the transformation.

164
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,260
One thing we know about this extension is that the negative even numbers get mapped to zero.

165
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,560
These are commonly called the trivial zeros.

166
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:50,400
The naming here stems from a long-standing tradition of mathematicians to call things trivial when they understand it quite well,

167
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,560
even when it's a fact that is not at all obvious from the outset.

168
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,660
We also know that the rest of the points that get mapped to zero

169
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,500
sit somewhere in this vertical strip, called the critical strip,

170
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,140
and the specific placement of those non-trivial zeros encodes a surprising information about prime numbers.

171
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,820
It's actually pretty interesting why this function carries so much information about primes,

172
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,580
and I definitely think I'll make a video about that later on,

173
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,720
but right now things are long enough, so I'll leave it unexplained.

174
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,580
Riemann hypothesized that all of these non-trivial zeros sit right in the middle of the strip,

175
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,640
on the line of numbers s, whose real part is one half.

176
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,880
This is called the critical line.

177
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,400
If that's true, it gives us a remarkably tight grasp on the pattern of prime numbers,

178
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,460
as well as many other patterns in math that stem from this.

179
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,320
Now, so far, when I've shown what the zeta function looks like,

180
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,100
I've only shown what it does to the portion of the grid on the screen,

181
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,600
and that kind of undersells its complexity.

182
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,760
So if I were to highlight this critical line and apply the transformation,

183
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,640
it might not seem to cross the origin at all.

184
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,960
However, here's what the transformed version of more and more of that line looks like.

185
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,820
Notice how it's passing through the number zero many, many times.

186
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,960
If you can prove that all of the non-trivial zeros sit somewhere on this line,

187
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,800
the Clay Math Institute gives you one million dollars.

188
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,520
And you'd also be proving hundreds, if not thousands, of modern math results

189
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
that have already been shown contingent on this hypothesis being true.

190
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,500
Another thing we know about this extended function

191
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,120
is that it maps the point negative one over to negative one twelfth.

192
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,020
And if you plug this into the original sum,

193
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,240
it looks like we're saying one plus two plus three plus four, on and on up to infinity, equals negative one twelfth.

194
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,280
Now, it might seem disingenuous to still call this a sum,

195
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,620
since the definition of the zeta function on the left half of the plane

196
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,120
is not defined directly from this sum.

197
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,520
Instead, it comes from analytically continuing the sum

198
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,620
beyond the domain where it converges.

199
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,060
That is, solving the jigsaw puzzle that began on the right half of the plane.

200
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,460
That said, you have to admit that the uniqueness of this analytic continuation,

201
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,820
the fact that the jigsaw puzzle has only one solution,

202
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,800
is very suggestive of some intrinsic connection between these extended values and the original sum.
