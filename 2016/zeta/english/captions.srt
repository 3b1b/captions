1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The Riemann zeta function. This is one of those objects in modern math that a lot of you might have heard of, but which can be really difficult to understand.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Don't worry, I'll explain that animation that you just saw in a few minutes.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A lot of people know about this function because there's a one million dollar prize out for anyone who can figure out when it equals zero, an open problem known as the Riemann hypothesis.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Some of you may have heard of it in the context of the divergent sum 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4, on and on up to infinity.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You see, there's a sense in which this sum equals negative 1 twelfth, which seems nonsensical if not obviously wrong.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But a common way to define what this equation is actually saying uses the Riemann zeta function.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But as any casual math enthusiast who started to read into this knows, its definition references this one idea called analytic continuation, which has to do with complex valued functions.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And this idea can be frustratingly opaque and unintuitive.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So what I'd like to do here is just show you all what this zeta function actually looks like, and to explain what this idea of analytic continuation is in a visual and more intuitive way.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm assuming that you know about complex numbers, and that you're comfortable working with them.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I'm tempted to say that you should know calculus, since analytic continuation is all about derivatives, but for the way I'm planning to present things I think you might actually be fine without that.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So to jump right into it, let's just define what this zeta function is.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:49,000
For a given input, where we commonly use the variable s, the function is 1 over 1 to the s, which is always 1, plus 1 over 2 to the s, plus 1 over 3 to the s, plus 1 over 4 to the s, on and on and on, summing up over all natural numbers.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So for example, let's say you plug in a value like s equals 2.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You'd get 1 plus 1 over 4 plus 1 over 9 plus 1 sixteenth, and as you keep adding more and more reciprocals of squares, this just so happens to approach pi squared over 6, which is around 1.645.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There's a very beautiful reason for why pi shows up here, and I might do a video on it at a later date, but that's just the tip of the iceberg for why this function is beautiful.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You could do the same thing for other inputs s, like 3 or 4, and sometimes you get other interesting values.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And so far, everything feels pretty reasonable. You're adding up smaller and smaller amounts, and these sums approach some number.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Great, no craziness here.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yet, if you were to read about it, you might see some people say that zeta of negative 1 equals negative 1 twelfth.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But looking at this infinite sum, that doesn't make any sense.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When you raise each term to the negative 1, flipping each fraction, you get 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on over all natural numbers.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And obviously that doesn't approach anything, certainly not negative 1 twelfth, right?

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And, as any mercenary looking into the Riemann hypothesis knows, this function is said to have trivial zeros at negative even numbers.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So for example, that would mean that zeta of negative 2 equals 0.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But when you plug in negative 2, it gives you 1 plus 4 plus 9 plus 16 on and on, which again obviously doesn't approach anything, much less 0, right?

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, we'll get to negative values in a few minutes, but for right now, let's just say the only thing that seems reasonable.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This function only makes sense when s is greater than 1, which is when this sum converges.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So far, it's simply not defined for other values.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, with that said, Bernard Riemann was somewhat of a father to complex analysis, which is the study of functions that have complex numbers as inputs and outputs.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So rather than just thinking about how this sum takes a number s on the real number line to another number on the real number line,

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
his main focus was on understanding what happens when you plug in a complex value for s.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So for example, maybe instead of plugging in 2, you would plug in 2 plus i.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, if you've never seen the idea of raising a number to the power of a complex value, it can feel kind of strange at first,

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because it no longer has anything to do with repeated multiplication.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But mathematicians found that there is a very nice and very natural way to extend the definition of exponents

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
beyond their familiar territory of real numbers and into the realm of complex values.

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not super crucial to understand complex exponents for where I'm going with this video,

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but I think it'll still be nice if we just summarize the gist of it here.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The basic idea is that when you write something like 1 half to the power of a complex number,

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you split it up as 1 half to the real part times 1 half to the pure imaginary part.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We're good on 1 half to the real part, there's no issues there.

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But what about raising something to a pure imaginary number?

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, the result is going to be some complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane.

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
As you let that pure imaginary input walk up and down the imaginary line,

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the resulting output walks around that unit circle.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
For a base like 1 half, the output walks around the unit circle somewhat slowly.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But for a base that's farther away from 1, like 1 ninth,

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
then as you let this input walk up and down the imaginary axis,

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the corresponding output is going to walk around the unit circle more quickly.

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you've never seen this and you're wondering why on earth this happens,

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I've left a few links to good resources in the description.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For here, I'm just going to move forward with the what without the why.

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The main takeaway is that when you raise something like 1 half to the power of 2 plus i,

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
which is 1 half squared times 1 half to the i,

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that 1 half to the i part is going to be on the unit circle,

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
meaning it has an absolute value of 1.

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So when you multiply it, it doesn't change the size of the number,

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
it just takes that 1 fourth and rotates it somewhat.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, if you were to plug in 2 plus i to the zeta function,

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
one way to think about what it does is to take the 1 half to the i part

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and think about what it does is to start off with all of the terms raised to the power of 2,

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
which you can think of as piecing together lines whose lengths are the reciprocals of squares of numbers,

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
which, like I said before, converges to pi squared over 6.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then when you change that input from 2 up to 2 plus i,

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
each of these lines gets rotated by some amount.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But importantly, the lengths of those lines won't change,

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
so the sum still converges.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It just does so in a spiral to some specific point on the complex plane.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Here, let me show what it looks like when I vary the input s,

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
represented with this yellow dot on the complex plane,

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
where this spiral sum is always going to be showing the converging value for zeta of s.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What this means is that zeta of s, defined as this infinite sum,

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is a perfectly reasonable complex function as long as the real part of the input is greater than 1,

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
meaning the input s sits somewhere on this right half of the complex plane.

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Again, this is because it's the real part of s that determines the size of each number,

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
while the imaginary part just dictates some rotation.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So now what I want to do is visualize this function.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It takes in inputs on the right half of the complex plane

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and spits out outputs somewhere else in the complex plane.

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A super nice way to understand complex functions is to visualize them as transformations,

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
meaning you look at every possible input to the function

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and just let it move over to the corresponding output.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
For example, let's take a moment and try to visualize something a little bit easier than the zeta function,

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
say f of s is equal to s squared.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When you plug in s equals 2, you get 4,

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
so we'll end up moving that point at 2 over to the point at 4.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When you plug in negative 1, you get 1,

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
so the point over here at negative 1 is going to end up moving over to the point at 1.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When you plug in i, by definition its square is negative 1,

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
so it's going to move over here to negative 1.

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now I'm going to add on a more colorful grid,

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and this is just because things are about to start moving,

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and it's kind of nice to have something to distinguish grid lines during that movement.

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
From here, I'll tell the computer to move every single point on this grid

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
over to its corresponding output under the function f of s equals s squared.

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Here's what it looks like.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That can be a lot to take in, so I'll go ahead and play it again.

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And this time, focus on one of the marked points,

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and notice how it moves over to the point corresponding to its square.

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It can be a little complicated to see all of the points moving all at once,

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
but the reward is that this gives us a very rich picture for what the complex function is actually doing,

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and it all happens in just two dimensions.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So back to the zeta function.

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We have this infinite sum, which is a function of some complex number s,

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and we feel good and happy about plugging in values of s whose real part is greater than 1,

107
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and getting some meaningful output via the converging spiral sum.

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So to visualize this function,

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going to take the portion of the grid sitting on the right side of the complex plane here,

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
where the real part of numbers is greater than 1,

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and I'm going to tell the computer to move each point of this grid to the appropriate output.

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It actually helps if I add a few more grid lines around the number 1,

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
since that region gets stretched out by quite a bit.

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Alright, so first of all, let's all just appreciate how beautiful that is.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, damn, if that doesn't make you want to learn more about complex functions, you have no heart.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But also, this transformed grid is just begging to be extended a little bit.

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For example, let's highlight these lines here,

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
which represent all of the complex numbers with imaginary part i or negative i.

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
After the transformation, these lines make such lovely arcs before they just abruptly stop.

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't you want to just, you know, continue those arcs?

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In fact, you can imagine how some altered version of the function,

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
with the definition that extends into this left half of the plane,

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
might be able to complete this picture with something that's quite pretty.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, this is exactly what mathematicians working with complex functions do.

125
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They continue the function beyond the original domain where it was defined.

126
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now, as soon as we branch over into inputs where the real part is less than 1,

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
this infinite sum that we originally used to define the function doesn't make sense anymore.

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You'll get nonsense like adding 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on up to infinity.

129
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But just looking at this transformed version of the right half of the plane,

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
where the sum does make sense,

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
it's just begging us to extend the set of points that we're considering as inputs,

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
even if that means defining the extended function in some way that doesn't necessarily use that sum.

133
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Of course, that leaves us with the question,

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
how would you define that function on the rest of the plane?

135
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You might think that you could extend it any number of ways.

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe you define an extension that makes it so the point at, say, s equals negative 1 moves over to negative 1 twelfth.

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But maybe you squiggle on some extension that makes it land on any other value.

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I mean, as soon as you open yourself up to the idea of defining the function differently

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
for values outside that domain of convergence,

140
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that is, not based on this infinite sum,

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the world is your oyster, and you can have any number of extensions, right?

142
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, not exactly.

143
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, yes, you can give any child a marker and have them extend these lines any which way,

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but if you add on the restriction that this new extended function has to have a derivative everywhere,

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it locks us into one and only one possible extension.

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I know, I know, I said that you wouldn't need to know about derivatives for this video,

147
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and even if you do know calculus, maybe you have yet to learn how to interpret derivatives for complex functions.

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But luckily for us, there is a very nice geometric intuition that you can keep in mind

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
for when I say a phrase like, has a derivative everywhere.

150
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Here, to show you what I mean, let's look back at that f of s equals s squared example.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Again, we think of this function as a transformation,

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
moving every point s of the complex plane over to the point s squared.

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
For those of you who know calculus, you know that you can take the derivative of this function at any given input,

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but there's an interesting property of that transformation

155
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that turns out to be related and almost equivalent to that fact.

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you look at any two lines in the input space that intersect at some angle,

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and consider what they turn into after the transformation,

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
they will still intersect each other at that same angle.

159
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The lines might get curved, and that's okay,

160
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
but the important part is that the angle at which they intersect remains unchanged.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And this is true for any pair of lines that you choose.

162
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So when I say a function has a derivative everywhere,

163
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I want you to think about this angle-preserving property,

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that any time two lines intersect, the angle between them remains unchanged after the transformation.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
At a glance, this is easiest to appreciate by noticing how all of the curves that the grid lines turn into

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
still intersect each other at right angles.

167
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Complex functions that have a derivative everywhere are called analytic,

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so you can think of this term analytic as meaning angle-preserving.

169
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Admittedly, I'm lying to you a little here, but only a little bit.

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
A slight caveat for those of you who want the full details

171
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is that at inputs where the derivative of a function is zero,

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
instead of angles being preserved, they get multiplied by some integer.

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But those points are by far the minority,

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and for almost all inputs to an analytic function, angles are preserved.

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So if when I say analytic you think angle-preserving, I think that's a fine intuition to have.

176
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Now, if you think about it for a moment, and this is a point that I really want you to appreciate,

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
this is a very restrictive property.

178
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The angle between any pair of intersecting lines has to remain unchanged.

179
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And yet, pretty much any function out there that has a name turns out to be analytic.

180
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The field of complex analysis, which Riemann helped to establish in its modern form,

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
is almost entirely about leveraging the properties of analytic functions

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
to understand results and patterns in other fields of math and science.

183
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The zeta function, defined by this infinite sum on the right half of the plane, is an analytic function.

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Notice how all of these curves that the gridlines turn into still intersect each other at right angles.

185
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So the surprising fact about complex functions is that if you want to extend an analytic function

186
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
beyond the domain where it was originally defined,

187
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
for example, extending this zeta function into the left half of the plane,

188
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
then if you require that the new extended function still be analytic,

189
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that is, that it still preserves angles everywhere,

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it forces you into only one possible extension, if one exists at all.

191
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's kind of like an infinite continuous jigsaw puzzle,

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
where this requirement of preserving angles locks you into one and only one choice for how to extend it.

193
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This process of extending an analytic function in the only way possible that's still analytic

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
is called, as you may have guessed, analytic continuation.

195
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So that's how the full Riemann zeta function is defined.

196
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
For values of s on the right half of the plane, where the real part is greater than 1,

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
just plug them into this sum and see where it converges.

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And that convergence might look like some kind of spiral,

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
since raising each of these terms to a complex power has the effect of rotating each one.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then for the rest of the plane, we know that there exists one and only one way to extend this definition

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
so that the function will still be analytic, that is, so that it still preserves angles at every single point.

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So we just say that by definition, the zeta function on the left half of the plane

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
is whatever that extension happens to be.

204
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And that's a valid definition because there's only one possible analytic continuation.

205
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Notice, that's a very implicit definition.

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It just says, use the solution of this jigsaw puzzle, which through more abstract derivation we know must exist,

207
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but it doesn't specify exactly how to solve it.

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Mathematicians have a pretty good grasp on what this extension looks like,

209
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but some important parts of it remain a mystery.

210
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
A million dollar mystery, in fact.

211
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's actually take a moment and talk about the Riemann hypothesis, the million dollar problem.

212
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The places where this function equals zero turn out to be quite important.

213
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That is, which points get mapped onto the origin after the transformation.

214
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
One thing we know about this extension is that the negative even numbers get mapped to zero.

215
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
These are commonly called the trivial zeros.

216
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The naming here stems from a long-standing tradition of mathematicians

217
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
to call things trivial when they understand it quite well,

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
even when it's a fact that is not at all obvious from the outset.

219
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We also know that the rest of the points that get mapped to zero

220
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
sit somewhere in this vertical strip, called the critical strip.

221
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And the specific placement of those non-trivial zeros encodes a surprising information about prime numbers.

222
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's actually pretty interesting why this function carries so much information about primes,

223
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and I definitely think I'll make a video about that later on, but right now things are long enough, so I'll leave it unexplained.

224
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Riemann hypothesized that all of these non-trivial zeros sit right in the middle of the strip,

225
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
on the line of numbers s, whose real part is one half.

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is called the critical line.

227
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If that's true, it gives us a remarkably tight grasp on the pattern of prime numbers,

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
as well as many other patterns in math that stem from this.

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now, so far, when I've shown what the zeta function looks like,

230
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've only shown what it does to the portion of the grid on the screen,

231
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and that kind of undersells its complexity.

232
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So if I were to highlight this critical line and apply the transformation,

233
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
it might not seem to cross the origin at all.

234
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
However, here's what the transformed version of more and more of that line looks like.

235
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Notice how it's passing through the number zero many, many times.

236
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If you can prove that all of the non-trivial zeros sit somewhere on this line,

237
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the Clay Math Institute gives you one million dollars,

238
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and you'd also be proving hundreds, if not thousands, of modern math results

239
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that have already been shown contingent on this hypothesis being true.

240
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Another thing we know about this extended function is that it maps the point negative one over to negative one twelve.

241
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And if you plug this into the original sum, it looks like we're saying one plus two plus three plus four,

242
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
on and on up to infinity, equals negative one twelve.

243
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now, it might seem disingenuous to still call this a sum,

244
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
since the definition of the zeta function on the left half of the plane is not defined directly from this sum.

245
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Instead, it comes from analytically continuing the sum beyond the domain where it converges.

246
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That is, solving the jigsaw puzzle that began on the first line of the line,

247
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
solving the jigsaw puzzle that began on the right half of the plane.

248
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That said, you have to admit that the uniqueness of this analytic continuation,

249
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
the fact that the jigsaw puzzle has only one solution,

250
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
is very suggestive of some intrinsic connection between these extended values and the original sum.
