1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,700
The Riemann zeta function.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,593
This is one of those objects in modern math that a lot of you might have heard of, 

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,440
but which can be really difficult to understand.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,180
Don't worry, I'll explain that animation that you just saw in a few minutes.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,005
A lot of people know about this function because there's a one 

6
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:22,654
million dollar prize out for anyone who can figure out when it equals zero, 

7
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,960
an open problem known as the Riemann hypothesis.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,871
Some of you may have heard of it in the context of the 

9
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:32,560
divergent sum 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on up to infinity.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,416
You see, there's a sense in which this sum equals negative 1 twelfth, 

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,180
which seems nonsensical if not obviously wrong.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,364
But a common way to define what this equation is 

13
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:45,920
actually saying uses the Riemann zeta function.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,792
But as any casual math enthusiast who started to read into this knows, 

15
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:54,767
its definition references this one idea called analytic continuation, 

16
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:57,380
which has to do with complex valued functions.

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,520
And this idea can be frustratingly opaque and unintuitive.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,986
So what I'd like to do here is just show you all what this zeta 

19
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:08,517
function actually looks like, and to explain what this idea of 

20
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:11,880
analytic continuation is in a visual and more intuitive way.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,073
I'm assuming that you know about complex numbers, 

22
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:18,000
and that you're comfortable working with them.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,052
And I'm tempted to say that you should know calculus, 

24
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:23,664
since analytic continuation is all about derivatives, 

25
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:26,808
but for the way I'm planning to present things I think you might 

26
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,260
actually be fine without that.

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,800
So to jump right into it, let's just define what this zeta function is.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,643
For a given input, where we commonly use the variable s, 

29
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:41,902
the function is 1 over 1 to the s, which is always 1, plus 1 over 2 to the s, 

30
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:46,352
plus 1 over 3 to the s, plus 1 over 4 to the s, on and on and on, 

31
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:48,780
summing up over all natural numbers.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,080
So for example, let's say you plug in a value like s equals 2.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,005
You'd get 1 plus 1 over 4 plus 1 over 9 plus 1 sixteenth, 

34
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:03,512
and as you keep adding more and more reciprocals of squares, 

35
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:08,979
this just so happens to approach pi squared over 6, which is around 1.645.

36
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,528
There's a very beautiful reason for why pi shows up here, 

37
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:16,438
and I might do a video on it at a later date, but that's just the tip of the iceberg for 

38
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:17,800
why this function is beautiful.

39
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,091
You could do the same thing for other inputs s, 

40
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,480
like 3 or 4, and sometimes you get other interesting values.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,180
And so far, everything feels pretty reasonable.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,640
You're adding up smaller and smaller amounts, and these sums approach some number.

43
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,800
Great, no craziness here.

44
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,402
Yet, if you were to read about it, you might see some 

45
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:40,500
people say that zeta of negative 1 equals negative 1 twelfth.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
But looking at this infinite sum, that doesn't make any sense.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,860
When you raise each term to the negative 1, flipping each fraction, 

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,160
you get 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on over all natural numbers.

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,760
And obviously that doesn't approach anything, certainly not negative 1 twelfth, right?

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,762
And, as any mercenary looking into the Riemann hypothesis knows, 

51
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:08,820
this function is said to have trivial zeros at negative even numbers.

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,760
So for example, that would mean that zeta of negative 2 equals 0.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,707
But when you plug in negative 2, it gives you 1 plus 4 plus 9 plus 16 on and on, 

54
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:23,700
which again obviously doesn't approach anything, much less 0, right?

55
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,321
Well, we'll get to negative values in a few minutes, 

56
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:30,620
but for right now, let's just say the only thing that seems reasonable.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,220
This function only makes sense when s is greater than 1, which is when this sum converges.

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,760
So far, it's simply not defined for other values.

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,412
Now, with that said, Bernard Riemann was somewhat of a father to complex analysis, 

60
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:49,820
which is the study of functions that have complex numbers as inputs and outputs.

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,817
So rather than just thinking about how this sum takes a number s on the 

62
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,232
real number line to another number on the real number line, 

63
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:03,240
his main focus was on understanding what happens when you plug in a complex value for s.

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,460
So for example, maybe instead of plugging in 2, you would plug in 2 plus i.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,549
Now, if you've never seen the idea of raising a number to the power of a complex value, 

66
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,605
it can feel kind of strange at first, because it no longer has 

67
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,740
anything to do with repeated multiplication.

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,244
But mathematicians found that there is a very nice and very natural 

69
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:27,618
way to extend the definition of exponents beyond their familiar 

70
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,940
territory of real numbers and into the realm of complex values.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,779
It's not super crucial to understand complex exponents for where I'm going with 

72
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,880
this video, but I think it'll still be nice if we just summarize the gist of it here.

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,261
The basic idea is that when you write something like 1 half to the power of a complex 

74
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:51,023
number, you split it up as 1 half to the real part times 1 half to the pure imaginary 

75
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:51,300
part.

76
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,260
We're good on 1 half to the real part, there's no issues there.

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,600
But what about raising something to a pure imaginary number?

78
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,938
Well, the result is going to be some complex number 

79
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,460
on the unit circle in the complex plane.

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,109
As you let that pure imaginary input walk up and down the imaginary line, 

81
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:17,300
the resulting output walks around that unit circle.

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,900
For a base like 1 half, the output walks around the unit circle somewhat slowly.

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,099
But for a base that's farther away from 1, like 1 ninth, 

84
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,759
then as you let this input walk up and down the imaginary axis, 

85
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,220
the corresponding output is going to walk around the unit circle more quickly.

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,282
If you've never seen this and you're wondering why on earth this happens, 

87
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,660
I've left a few links to good resources in the description.

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,020
For here, I'm just going to move forward with the what without the why.

89
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,724
The main takeaway is that when you raise something like 1 half to the power of 2 plus i, 

90
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:57,652
which is 1 half squared times 1 half to the i, 

91
00:05:57,652 --> 00:06:01,452
that 1 half to the i part is going to be on the unit circle, 

92
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,820
meaning it has an absolute value of 1.

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,272
So when you multiply it, it doesn't change the size of the number, 

94
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,060
it just takes that 1 fourth and rotates it somewhat.

95
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,421
So, if you were to plug in 2 plus i to the zeta function, 

96
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:23,060
one way to think about what it does is to start off with all of the terms raised 

97
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,756
to the power of 2, which you can think of as piecing together lines whose lengths 

98
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:31,764
are the reciprocals of squares of numbers, which, like I said before, 

99
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,540
converges to pi squared over 6.

100
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,525
Then when you change that input from 2 up to 2 plus i, 

101
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:40,340
each of these lines gets rotated by some amount.

102
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,369
But importantly, the lengths of those lines won't change, so the sum still converges, 

103
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,580
it just does so in a spiral to some specific point on the complex plane.

104
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,059
Here, let me show what it looks like when I vary the input s, 

105
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:56,879
represented with this yellow dot on the complex plane, 

106
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,340
where this spiral sum is always going to be showing the converging value for zeta of s.

107
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,012
What this means is that zeta of s, defined as this infinite sum, 

108
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:22,236
is a perfectly reasonable complex function as long as the real part of the input 

109
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:27,397
is greater than 1, meaning the input s sits somewhere on this right half of the 

110
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:28,300
complex plane.

111
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,708
Again, this is because it's the real part of s that determines the size of each number, 

112
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,460
while the imaginary part just dictates some rotation.

113
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,360
So now what I want to do is visualize this function.

114
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,780
It takes in inputs on the right half of the complex plane 

115
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,020
and spits out outputs somewhere else in the complex plane.

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,748
A super nice way to understand complex functions is to visualize them as transformations, 

117
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:58,405
meaning you look at every possible input to the function and just 

118
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:00,900
let it move over to the corresponding output.

119
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,079
For example, let's take a moment and try to visualize 

120
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,180
something a little bit easier than the zeta function.

121
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,820
Say f of s is equal to s squared.

122
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,647
When you plug in s equals 2, you get 4, so we'll 

123
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,160
end up moving that point at 2 over to the point at 4.

124
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,490
When you plug in negative 1, you get 1, so the point over here 

125
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,100
at negative 1 is going to end up moving over to the point at 1.

126
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,602
When you plug in i, by definition its square is negative 1, 

127
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:31,380
so it's going to move over here to negative 1.

128
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,831
Now I'm going to add on a more colorful grid, and this is just 

129
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,524
because things are about to start moving, and it's kind of nice 

130
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:40,260
to have something to distinguish grid lines during that movement.

131
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,132
From here, I'll tell the computer to move every single point on this grid 

132
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:49,520
over to its corresponding output under the function f of s equals s squared.

133
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,340
Here's what it looks like.

134
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,260
That can be a lot to take in, so I'll go ahead and play it again.

135
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,018
And this time, focus on one of the marked points, 

136
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:04,880
and notice how it moves over to the point corresponding to its square.

137
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,951
It can be a little complicated to see all of the points moving all at once, 

138
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,370
but the reward is that this gives us a very rich picture for what the 

139
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,180
complex function is actually doing, and it all happens in just two dimensions.

140
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,800
So, back to the zeta function.

141
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,131
We have this infinite sum, which is a function of some complex number s, 

142
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:30,308
and we feel good and happy about plugging in values of s whose real part is 

143
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:34,760
greater than 1, and getting some meaningful output via the converging spiral sum.

144
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,806
So to visualize this function, I'm going to take the portion of the grid sitting on the 

145
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:44,013
right side of the complex plane here, where the real part of numbers is greater than 1, 

146
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:48,125
and I'm going to tell the computer to move each point of this grid to the appropriate 

147
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:48,460
output.

148
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,375
It actually helps if I add a few more grid lines around the number 1, 

149
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,720
since that region gets stretched out by quite a bit.

150
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,580
Alright, so first of all, let's all just appreciate how beautiful that is.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,076
I mean, damn, if that doesn't make you want to learn more about complex functions, 

152
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:08,960
you have no heart.

153
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,700
But also, this transformed grid is just begging to be extended a little bit.

154
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,737
For example, let's highlight these lines here, 

155
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:24,600
which represent all of the complex numbers with imaginary part i, or negative i.

156
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,756
After the transformation, these lines make such 

157
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:32,280
lovely arcs before they just abruptly stop.

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,760
Don't you want to just, you know, continue those arcs?

159
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,208
In fact, you can imagine how some altered version of the function, 

160
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,515
with a definition that extends into this left half of the plane, 

161
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:47,280
might be able to complete this picture with something that's quite pretty.

162
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,360
Well, this is exactly what mathematicians working with complex functions do.

163
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,280
They continue the function beyond the original domain where it was defined.

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,222
Now, as soon as we branch over into inputs where the real part is less than 1, 

165
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:06,712
this infinite sum that we originally used to define the function doesn't make sense 

166
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:07,140
anymore.

167
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,560
You'll get nonsense, like adding 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 on and on up to infinity.

168
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,142
But just looking at this transformed version of the right half of the plane, 

169
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,268
where the sum does make sense, it's just begging us to extend 

170
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:21,840
the set of points that we're considering as inputs.

171
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,190
Even if that means defining the extended function 

172
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,020
in some way that doesn't necessarily use that sum.

173
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,114
Of course, that leaves us with the question, how 

174
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,280
would you define that function on the rest of the plane?

175
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,680
You might think that you could extend it any number of ways.

176
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,591
Maybe you define an extension that makes it so the point at, 

177
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:44,760
say, s equals negative 1 moves over to negative 1 twelfth.

178
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,280
But maybe you squiggle on some extension that makes it land on any other value.

179
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,570
I mean, as soon as you open yourself up to the idea of defining the function differently 

180
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,801
for values outside that domain of convergence, that is, not based on this infinite sum, 

181
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:06,260
the world is your oyster, and you can have any number of extensions, right?

182
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,940
Well, not exactly.

183
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,162
I mean, yes, you can give any child a marker and have them extend these lines any 

184
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:19,020
which way, but if you add on the restriction that this new extended function has to 

185
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,820
have a derivative everywhere, it locks us into one and only one possible extension.

186
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,175
I know, I know, I said that you wouldn't need to know about derivatives for this video, 

187
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:32,051
and even if you do know calculus, maybe you have yet to learn how 

188
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,100
to interpret derivatives for complex functions.

189
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,433
But luckily for us, there is a very nice geometric intuition that you 

190
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:42,240
can keep in mind for when I say a phrase like, has a derivative everywhere.

191
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,220
Here, to show you what I mean, let's look back at that f of s equals s squared example.

192
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,951
Again, we think of this function as a transformation, 

193
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,960
moving every point s of the complex plane over to the point s squared.

194
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,822
For those of you who know calculus, you know that you can take the derivative 

195
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:03,709
of this function at any given input, but there's an interesting property of that 

196
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,500
transformation that turns out to be related and almost equivalent to that fact.

197
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,092
If you look at any two lines in the input space that intersect at some angle, 

198
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,369
and consider what they turn into after the transformation, 

199
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:19,480
they will still intersect each other at that same angle.

200
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,464
The lines might get curved, and that's okay, but the important 

201
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:28,072
part is that the angle at which they intersect remains unchanged, 

202
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:31,080
and this is true for any pair of lines that you choose.

203
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,812
So when I say a function has a derivative everywhere, 

204
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:41,068
I want you to think about this angle-preserving property, 

205
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:44,774
that any time two lines intersect, the angle between them remains 

206
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,740
unchanged after the transformation.

207
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,028
At a glance, this is easiest to appreciate by noticing how all of the curves 

208
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:55,980
that the grid lines turn into still intersect each other at right angles.

209
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,355
Complex functions that have a derivative everywhere are called analytic, 

210
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,820
so you can think of this term analytic as meaning angle-preserving.

211
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,980
Admittedly, I'm lying to you a little here, but only a little bit.

212
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,312
A slight caveat for those of you who want the full details is 

213
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:16,084
that at inputs where the derivative of a function is zero, 

214
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:19,420
instead of angles being preserved, they get multiplied by some integer.

215
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,690
But those points are by far the minority, and for almost 

216
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,780
all inputs to an analytic function, angles are preserved.

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,368
So if when I say analytic, you think angle-preserving, 

218
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:34,440
I think that's a fine intuition to have.

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,304
Now, if you think about it for a moment, and this is a point that 

220
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:45,760
I really want you to appreciate, this is a very restrictive property.

221
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,680
The angle between any pair of intersecting lines has to remain unchanged.

222
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,780
And yet, pretty much any function out there that has a name turns out to be analytic.

223
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,970
The field of complex analysis, which Riemann helped to establish in its modern form, 

224
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,039
is almost entirely about leveraging the properties of analytic functions to 

225
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,680
understand results and patterns in other fields of math and science.

226
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,238
The zeta function, defined by this infinite sum on the right half of the plane, 

227
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,540
is an analytic function.

228
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,929
Notice how all of these curves that the grid lines 

229
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,620
turn into still intersect each other at right angles.

230
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,892
So the surprising fact about complex functions is that if you want to extend an 

231
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:37,804
analytic function beyond the domain where it was originally defined, for example, 

232
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:41,518
extending this zeta function into the left half of the plane, 

233
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:46,250
then if you require that the new extended function still be analytic, that is, 

234
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,043
that it still preserves angles everywhere, it forces you into only one possible 

235
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:52,960
extension, if one exists at all.

236
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,720
It's kind of like an infinite continuous jigsaw puzzle, 

237
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,492
where this requirement of preserving angles locks you into one and only one choice 

238
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:02,700
for how to extend it.

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,641
This process of extending an analytic function in the only way possible that's 

240
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:12,560
still analytic is called, as you may have guessed, analytic continuation.

241
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,720
So that's how the full Riemann zeta function is defined.

242
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,428
For values of s on the right half of the plane, where the real part is greater than 1, 

243
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:25,220
we can plug them into this sum and see where it converges.

244
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,465
And that convergence might look like some kind of spiral, 

245
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:32,740
since raising each of these terms to a complex power has the effect of rotating each one.

246
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,159
Then for the rest of the plane, we know that there exists one and only 

247
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,208
one way to extend this definition so that the function will still be analytic, 

248
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,540
that is, so that it still preserves angles at every single point.

249
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,609
So we just say that by definition, the zeta function on the 

250
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:52,140
left half of the plane is whatever that extension happens to be.

251
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,260
And that's a valid definition because there's only one possible analytic continuation.

252
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,900
Notice, that's a very implicit definition.

253
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,525
It just says, use the solution of this jigsaw puzzle, 

254
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,917
which through more abstract derivation we know must exist, 

255
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,619
but it doesn't specify exactly how to solve it.

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,611
Mathematicians have a pretty good grasp on what this extension looks like, 

257
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:16,819
but some important parts of it remain a mystery.

258
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,940
A million dollar mystery, in fact.

259
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,453
Let's actually take a moment and talk about the Riemann hypothesis, 

260
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:23,859
which is a million dollar problem.

261
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,157
The places where this function equals zero turn out to be quite important, 

262
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:33,280
that is, which points get mapped onto the origin after the transformation.

263
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,921
One thing we know about this extension is that 

264
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,260
the negative even numbers get mapped to zero.

265
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,560
These are commonly called the trivial zeros.

266
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,671
The naming here stems from a long-standing tradition of mathematicians 

267
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:50,473
to call things trivial when they understand it quite well, 

268
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:53,560
even when it's a fact that is not at all obvious from the outset.

269
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,086
We also know that the rest of the points that get mapped to zero sit somewhere 

270
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:02,008
in this vertical strip, called the critical strip, 

271
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:06,306
and the specific placement of those non-trivial zeros encodes a surprising 

272
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:08,140
information about prime numbers.

273
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,536
It's actually pretty interesting why this function carries so much information 

274
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:15,822
about primes, and I definitely think I'll make a video about that later on, 

275
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:18,720
but right now things are long enough, so I'll leave it unexplained.

276
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,180
Riemann hypothesized that all of these non-trivial zeros sit right in the 

277
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,640
middle of the strip, on the line of numbers s, whose real part is one half.

278
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,880
This is called the critical line.

279
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,335
If that's true, it gives us a remarkably tight grasp on the pattern of prime numbers, 

280
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:39,460
as well as many other patterns in math that stem from this.

281
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,669
Now, so far, when I've shown what the zeta function looks like, 

282
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,363
I've only shown what it does to the portion of the grid on the screen, 

283
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:49,600
and that kind of undersells its complexity.

284
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,270
So if I were to highlight this critical line and apply the transformation, 

285
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,640
it might not seem to cross the origin at all.

286
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,960
However, here's what the transformed version of more and more of that line looks like.

287
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,820
Notice how it's passing through the number zero many, many times.

288
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,836
If you can prove that all of the non-trivial zeros sit somewhere on this line, 

289
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,800
the Clay Math Institute gives you one million dollars.

290
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,855
And you'd also be proving hundreds, if not thousands, 

291
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:24,294
of modern math results that have already been shown contingent on this 

292
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:25,360
hypothesis being true.

293
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,296
Another thing we know about this extended function is that 

294
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:32,120
it maps the point negative one over to negative one twelfth.

295
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,200
And if you plug this into the original sum, it looks like we're saying one plus 

296
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,240
two plus three plus four, on and on up to infinity, equals negative one twelfth.

297
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,305
Now, it might seem disingenuous to still call this a sum, 

298
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:49,904
since the definition of the zeta function on the left half of the plane is not defined 

299
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:51,120
directly from this sum.

300
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,233
Instead, it comes from analytically continuing 

301
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,620
the sum beyond the domain where it converges.

302
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,060
That is, solving the jigsaw puzzle that began on the right half of the plane.

303
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,146
That said, you have to admit that the uniqueness of this analytic continuation, 

304
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:09,080
the fact that the jigsaw puzzle has only one solution, 

305
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,240
is very suggestive of some intrinsic connection between these extended values 

306
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,360
and the original sum.
