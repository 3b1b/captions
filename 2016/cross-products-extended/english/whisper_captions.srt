1
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,200
Hey folks, where we left off I was talking about how to compute a three-dimensional cross

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,000
product between two vectors, v cross w.

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,520
It's this funny thing where you write a matrix whose second column has the coordinates of

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,400
v, whose third column has the coordinates of w, but the entries of that first column,

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,560
weirdly, are the symbols i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat, where you just pretend like those guys

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,600
are numbers for the sake of computations.

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,460
Then with that funky matrix in hand, you compute its determinant.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,900
If you just chug along with those computations, ignoring the weirdness, you get some constant

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,640
times i-hat, plus some constant times j-hat, plus some constant times k-hat.

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,300
How specifically you think about computing that determinant is kind of beside the point.

11
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,480
All that really matters here is that you'll end up with three different numbers that are

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,280
interpreted as the coordinates of some resulting vector.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,220
From here, students are typically told to just believe that the resulting vector has

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,040
the following geometric properties.

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Its length equals the area of the parallelogram defined by v and w.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,620
It points in a direction perpendicular to both v and w, and this direction obeys the

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,420
right-hand rule, in the sense that if you point your forefinger along v and your middle

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,340
finger along w, then when you stick up your thumb, it'll point in the direction of the

19
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,860
new vector.

20
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,160
There are some brute force computations that you could do to confirm these facts, but I

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,440
want to share with you a really elegant line of reasoning.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,920
It leverages a bit of background, though, so for this video I'm assuming that everybody

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,920
has watched chapter 5 on the determinant and chapter 7, where I introduced the idea of

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,660
duality.

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,660
As a quick reminder, the idea of duality is that any time you have a linear transformation

26
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,580
from some space to the number line, it's associated with a unique vector in that space, in the

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,460
sense that performing the linear transformation is the same as taking a dot product with

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,200
that vector.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,820
Numerically, this is because one of those transformations is described by a matrix with

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,980
just one row, where each column tells you the number that each basis vector lands on.

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,920
And multiplying this matrix by some vector v is computationally identical to taking the

32
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,000
dot product between v and the vector you get by turning that matrix on its side.

33
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,680
The takeaway is that whenever you're out in the mathematical wild and you find a linear

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,400
transformation to the number line, you will be able to match it to some vector, which

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,440
is called the dual vector of that transformation, so that performing the linear transformation

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,480
is the same as taking a dot product with that vector.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
The cross product gives us a really slick example of this process in action.

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,040
It takes some effort, but it's definitely worth it.

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,380
What I'm going to do is define a certain linear transformation from three dimensions to the

40
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,240
number line, and it'll be defined in terms of the two vectors v and w.

41
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,340
Then when we associate that transformation with its dual vector in 3D space, that dual

42
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,560
vector is going to be the cross product of v and w.

43
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,060
The reason for doing this will be that understanding that transformation is going to make clear

44
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,600
the connection between the computation and the geometry of the cross product.

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,500
So to back up a bit, remember in two dimensions what it meant to compute the 2D version of

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,200
the cross product?

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,860
When you have two vectors v and w, you put the coordinates of v as the first column of

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,440
a matrix and the coordinates of w as the second column of a matrix.

49
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,300
Then you just compute the determinant.

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,040
There's no nonsense with basis vectors stuck in a matrix or anything like that, just an

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,020
ordinary determinant returning a number.

52
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,600
Geometrically, this gives us the area of a parallelogram spanned out by those two vectors,

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,800
with the possibility of being negative depending on the orientation of the vectors.

54
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,460
Now, if you didn't already know the 3D cross product and you're trying to extrapolate,

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,760
you might imagine that it involves taking three separate 3D vectors, u, v, and w, and

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,540
making their coordinates the columns of a 3x3 matrix, then computing the determinant

57
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,480
of that matrix.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,020
And as you know from chapter 5, geometrically this would give you the volume of a parallelepiped

59
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,900
spanned out by those three vectors, with a plus or minus sign depending on the right

60
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,180
hand rule orientation of those three vectors.

61
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,920
Of course, you all know that this is not the 3D cross product.

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,100
The actual 3D cross product takes in two vectors and spits out a vector.

63
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,060
It doesn't take in three vectors and spit out a number.

64
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,640
But this idea actually gets us really close to what the real cross product is.

65
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,840
Consider that first vector u to be a variable, say with variable entries x, y, and z, while

66
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,740
v and w remain fixed.

67
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,600
What we have then is a function from three dimensions to the number line.

68
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,240
You input some vector x, y, z and you get out a number by taking the determinant of

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,820
a matrix whose first column is x, y, z and whose other two columns are the coordinates

70
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,160
of the constant vectors v and w.

71
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,180
Geometrically, the meaning of this function is that for any input vector x, y, z, you

72
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,780
consider the parallelepiped defined by this vector v and w.

73
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,380
Then you return its volume with a plus or minus sign depending on orientation.

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,740
Now, this might feel like kind of a random thing to do.

75
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,700
I mean, where does this function come from?

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
Why are we defining it this way?

77
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,680
And I'll admit, at this stage it might kind of feel like it's coming out of the blue.

78
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,260
But if you're willing to go along with it and play around with the properties that this

79
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,360
guy has, it's the key to understanding the cross product.

80
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,160
One really important fact about this function is that it's linear.

81
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,320
I'll actually leave it to you to work through the details of why this is true based on properties

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,240
of the determinant.

83
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,780
But once you know that it's linear, we can start bringing in the idea of duality.

84
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,080
Once you know that it's linear, you know that there's some way to describe this function

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,740
as matrix multiplication.

86
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,580
Specifically, since it's a function that goes from three dimensions to one dimension,

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,920
there will be a one by three matrix that encodes this transformation.

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,820
And the whole idea of duality is that the special thing about transformations from several

89
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,760
dimensions to one dimension is that you can turn that matrix on its side and instead interpret

90
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,480
the entire transformation as the dot product with a certain vector.

91
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:14,020
What we're looking for is the special 3D vector that I'll call p such that taking the dot

92
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,780
product between p and any other vector x, y, z gives the same result as plugging in

93
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,940
x, y, z as the first column of a three by three matrix whose other two columns have

94
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,260
the coordinates of v and w, then computing the determinant.

95
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,040
I'll get to the geometry of this in just a moment, but right now let's dig in and think

96
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
about what this means computationally.

97
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,860
Taking the dot product between p and x, y, z will give us something times x plus something

98
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,240
times y plus something times z, where those somethings are the coordinates of p.

99
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,340
But on the right side here, when you compute the determinant, you can organize it to look

100
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,540
like some constant times x plus some constant times y plus some constant times z, where

101
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,140
those constants involve certain combinations of the components of v and w.

102
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,520
So those constants, those particular combinations of the coordinates of v and w are going to

103
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,140
be the coordinates of the vector p that we're looking for.

104
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,660
But what's going on on the right here should feel very familiar to anyone who's actually

105
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,580
worked through a cross product computation.

106
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,260
Collecting the constant terms that are multiplied by x, y, and by z like this is no different

107
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,700
from plugging in the symbols i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat to that first column, and seeing

108
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,680
which coefficients aggregate on each one of those terms.

109
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,780
It's just that plugging in i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat is a way of signaling that we should

110
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,260
interpret those coefficients as the coordinates of a vector.

111
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,720
So what all of this is saying is that this funky computation can be thought of as a way

112
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,260
to answer the following question.

113
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,540
What vector p has the special property that when you take a dot product between p and

114
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,500
some vector x, y, z, it gives the same result as plugging in x, y, z to the first column

115
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,640
of a matrix whose other two columns have the coordinates of v and w, then computing the

116
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,200
determinant.

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,780
That's a bit of a mouthful, but it's an important question to digest for this video.

118
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,120
Now for the cool part, which ties all this together with the geometric understanding

119
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,560
of the cross product that I introduced last video.

120
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,720
I'm going to ask the same question again, but this time we're going to try to answer

121
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,020
it geometrically instead of computationally.

122
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,080
What 3D vector p has the special property that when you take a dot product between p

123
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,120
and some other vector x, y, z, it gives the same result as if you took the signed volume

124
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,140
of a parallelepiped defined by this vector x, y, z along with v and w.

125
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,440
Remember, the geometric interpretation of a dot product between a vector p and some

126
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,480
other vector is to project that other vector onto p, then to multiply the length of that

127
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,500
projection by the length of p.

128
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,300
With that in mind, let me show a certain way to think about the volume of the parallelepiped

129
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,440
that we care about.

130
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,440
Start by taking the area of the parallelogram defined by v and w, then multiply it not by

131
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,760
the length of x, y, z, but by the component of x, y, z that's perpendicular to that parallelogram.

132
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,480
In other words, the way our linear function works on a given vector is to project that

133
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,980
vector onto a line that's perpendicular to both v and w, then to multiply the length

134
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,120
of that projection by the area of the parallelogram spanned by v and w.

135
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,800
But this is the same thing as taking a dot product between x, y, z and a vector that's

136
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,920
perpendicular to v and w with a length equal to the area of that parallelogram.

137
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,420
What's more, if you choose the appropriate direction for that vector, the cases where

138
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,880
the dot product is negative will line up with the cases where the right hand rule for the

139
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,320
orientation of x, y, z, v and w is negative.

140
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,200
This means that we just found a vector p so that taking a dot product between p and some

141
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,520
vector x, y, z is the same thing as computing that determinant of a 3x3 matrix whose columns

142
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,560
are x, y, z, the coordinates of v and w.

143
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,080
So the answer that we found earlier computationally using that special notational trick must correspond

144
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,100
geometrically to this vector.

145
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:50,300
This is the fundamental reason why the computation and the geometric interpretation of the cross product are related.

146
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,200
Just to sum up what happened here, I started by defining a linear transformation from 3D space to the number line,

147
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,420
and it was defined in terms of the vectors v and w.

148
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,900
Then I went through two separate ways to think about the dual vector of this transformation,

149
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,020
the vector such that applying the transformation is the same thing as taking a dot product with that vector.

150
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,220
On the one hand, a computational approach will lead you to the trick of plugging in the symbols i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat

151
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,540
to the first column of a matrix and computing the determinant.

152
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,580
But thinking geometrically, we can deduce that this dual vector must be perpendicular to v and w

153
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,040
with a length equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned out by those two vectors.

154
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,020
Since both of these approaches give us a dual vector to the same transformation, they must be the same vector.

155
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,580
So that wraps up dot products and cross products,

156
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,500
and the next video will be a really important concept for linear algebra, change of basis.

157
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,140
you
