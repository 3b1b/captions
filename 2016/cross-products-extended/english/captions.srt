1
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,241
Hey folks, where we left off I was talking about how to compute 

2
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:24,000
a three-dimensional cross product between two vectors, v cross w.

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,525
It's this funny thing where you write a matrix whose second column has the 

4
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:33,090
coordinates of v, whose third column has the coordinates of w, 

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,449
but the entries of that first column, weirdly, are the symbols i-hat, j-hat, 

6
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:41,694
and k-hat, where you just pretend like those guys are numbers for the sake 

7
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:42,600
of computations.

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,460
Then with that funky matrix in hand, you compute its determinant.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,128
If you just chug along with those computations, ignoring the weirdness, 

10
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:55,896
you get some constant times i-hat, plus some constant times j-hat, 

11
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,640
plus some constant times k-hat.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,300
How specifically you think about computing that determinant is kind of beside the point.

13
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,027
All that really matters here is that you'll end up with three different 

14
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,280
numbers that are interpreted as the coordinates of some resulting vector.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,900
From here, students are typically told to just believe that 

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,040
the resulting vector has the following geometric properties.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Its length equals the area of the parallelogram defined by v and w.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,785
It points in a direction perpendicular to both v and w, 

19
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:32,547
and this direction obeys the right-hand rule, in the sense that if 

20
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:36,254
you point your forefinger along v and your middle finger along w, 

21
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:40,860
then when you stick up your thumb, it'll point in the direction of the new vector.

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,467
There are some brute force computations that you could do to confirm these facts, 

23
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,440
but I want to share with you a really elegant line of reasoning.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,247
It leverages a bit of background, though, so for this video 

25
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:58,626
I'm assuming that everybody has watched chapter 5 on the determinant and chapter 7, 

26
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,660
where I introduced the idea of duality.

27
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,575
As a quick reminder, the idea of duality is that any time you have a 

28
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:11,934
linear transformation from some space to the number line, 

29
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,945
it's associated with a unique vector in that space, 

30
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:18,999
in the sense that performing the linear transformation is the same as 

31
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,200
taking a dot product with that vector.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,115
Numerically, this is because one of those transformations is described by a matrix with 

33
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:31,980
just one row, where each column tells you the number that each basis vector lands on.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,120
And multiplying this matrix by some vector v is computationally identical to taking 

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,000
the dot product between v and the vector you get by turning that matrix on its side.

36
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,726
The takeaway is that whenever you're out in the mathematical wild and you find 

37
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:55,397
a linear transformation to the number line, you will be able to match it to some vector, 

38
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:58,336
which is called the dual vector of that transformation, 

39
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:02,587
so that performing the linear transformation is the same as taking a dot product 

40
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:03,480
with that vector.

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
The cross product gives us a really slick example of this process in action.

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,040
It takes some effort, but it's definitely worth it.

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,152
What I'm going to do is define a certain linear transformation from three dimensions 

44
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:22,240
to the number line, and it'll be defined in terms of the two vectors v and w.

45
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,396
Then when we associate that transformation with its dual vector in 3D space, 

46
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,560
that dual vector is going to be the cross product of v and w.

47
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,828
The reason for doing this will be that understanding that transformation is going to 

48
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:42,600
make clear the connection between the computation and the geometry of the cross product.

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,384
So to back up a bit, remember in two dimensions what 

50
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:50,200
it meant to compute the 2D version of the cross product?

51
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,130
When you have two vectors v and w, you put the coordinates of v as the first 

52
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,440
column of a matrix and the coordinates of w as the second column of a matrix.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,300
Then you just compute the determinant.

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,642
There's no nonsense with basis vectors stuck in a matrix or anything like that, 

55
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:08,020
just an ordinary determinant returning a number.

56
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,819
Geometrically, this gives us the area of a parallelogram spanned out by those two 

57
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:18,366
vectors, with the possibility of being negative depending on the orientation of the 

58
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:18,800
vectors.

59
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:25,420
Now, if you didn't already know the 3D cross product and you're trying to extrapolate, 

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,894
you might imagine that it involves taking three separate 3D vectors, 

61
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:34,497
u, v, and w, and making their coordinates the columns of a 3x3 matrix, 

62
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:37,480
then computing the determinant of that matrix.

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,365
And as you know from chapter 5, geometrically this would give you the volume 

64
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:46,655
of a parallelepiped spanned out by those three vectors, 

65
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:51,004
with a plus or minus sign depending on the right hand rule orientation of 

66
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,180
those three vectors.

67
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,920
Of course, you all know that this is not the 3D cross product.

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,100
The actual 3D cross product takes in two vectors and spits out a vector.

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,060
It doesn't take in three vectors and spit out a number.

70
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,640
But this idea actually gets us really close to what the real cross product is.

71
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,160
Consider that first vector u to be a variable, 

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,740
say with variable entries x, y, and z, while v and w remain fixed.

73
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,600
What we have then is a function from three dimensions to the number line.

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,336
You input some vector x, y, z and you get out a number by taking 

75
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:34,916
the determinant of a matrix whose first column is x, y, 

76
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:40,160
z and whose other two columns are the coordinates of the constant vectors v and w.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,087
Geometrically, the meaning of this function is that for any input vector x, 

78
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:50,780
y, z, you consider the parallelepiped defined by this vector v and w.

79
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,380
Then you return its volume with a plus or minus sign depending on orientation.

80
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,740
Now, this might feel like kind of a random thing to do.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,700
I mean, where does this function come from?

82
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
Why are we defining it this way?

83
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,680
And I'll admit, at this stage it might kind of feel like it's coming out of the blue.

84
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,928
But if you're willing to go along with it and play around with the 

85
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:13,360
properties that this guy has, it's the key to understanding the cross product.

86
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,160
One really important fact about this function is that it's linear.

87
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,607
I'll actually leave it to you to work through the details 

88
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:25,240
of why this is true based on properties of the determinant.

89
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,780
But once you know that it's linear, we can start bringing in the idea of duality.

90
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,999
Once you know that it's linear, you know that there's some 

91
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,740
way to describe this function as matrix multiplication.

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,091
Specifically, since it's a function that goes from three dimensions to one dimension, 

93
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:49,920
there will be a one by three matrix that encodes this transformation.

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,664
And the whole idea of duality is that the special thing about transformations from 

95
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:02,072
several dimensions to one dimension is that you can turn that matrix on its side and 

96
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:06,480
instead interpret the entire transformation as the dot product with a certain vector.

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,166
What we're looking for is the special 3D vector that I'll call p such that taking 

98
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,570
the dot product between p and any other vector x, y, 

99
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,580
z gives the same result as plugging in x, y, z as the first column of a three 

100
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,268
by three matrix whose other two columns have the coordinates of v and w, 

101
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,260
then computing the determinant.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,426
I'll get to the geometry of this in just a moment, 

103
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:34,760
but right now let's dig in and think about what this means computationally.

104
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,208
Taking the dot product between p and x, y, z will give us something times x plus 

105
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:47,240
something times y plus something times z, where those somethings are the coordinates of p.

106
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,709
But on the right side here, when you compute the determinant, 

107
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,642
you can organize it to look like some constant times x plus some constant times y 

108
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:01,575
plus some constant times z, where those constants involve certain combinations of 

109
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,140
the components of v and w.

110
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,418
So those constants, those particular combinations of the coordinates of v 

111
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:13,140
and w are going to be the coordinates of the vector p that we're looking for.

112
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,467
But what's going on on the right here should feel very familiar to 

113
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,580
anyone who's actually worked through a cross product computation.

114
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,344
Collecting the constant terms that are multiplied by x, y, 

115
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:33,899
and by z like this is no different from plugging in the symbols i-hat, j-hat, 

116
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,570
and k-hat to that first column, and seeing which coefficients aggregate on each 

117
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,679
one of those terms.

118
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,053
It's just that plugging in i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat is a way of signaling 

119
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:49,260
that we should interpret those coefficients as the coordinates of a vector.

120
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,294
So what all of this is saying is that this funky computation 

121
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:57,260
can be thought of as a way to answer the following question.

122
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,803
What vector p has the special property that when you take a dot 

123
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:07,263
product between p and some vector x, y, z, it gives the same result as plugging in x, 

124
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:11,454
y, z to the first column of a matrix whose other two columns have 

125
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:15,200
the coordinates of v and w, then computing the determinant.

126
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,780
That's a bit of a mouthful, but it's an important question to digest for this video.

127
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,554
Now for the cool part, which ties all this together with the geometric 

128
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,560
understanding of the cross product that I introduced last video.

129
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,851
I'm going to ask the same question again, but this time we're 

130
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:35,020
going to try to answer it geometrically instead of computationally.

131
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,447
What 3D vector p has the special property that when you take a dot product between 

132
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:48,548
p and some other vector x, y, z, it gives the same result as if you took the signed 

133
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:54,140
volume of a parallelepiped defined by this vector x, y, z along with v and w.

134
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,483
Remember, the geometric interpretation of a dot product between a 

135
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:06,156
vector p and some other vector is to project that other vector onto p, 

136
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:10,500
then to multiply the length of that projection by the length of p.

137
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,343
With that in mind, let me show a certain way to think 

138
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:19,440
about the volume of the parallelepiped that we care about.

139
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,635
Start by taking the area of the parallelogram defined by v and w, 

140
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:29,563
then multiply it not by the length of x, y, z, but by the component of x, 

141
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,760
y, z that's perpendicular to that parallelogram.

142
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,625
In other words, the way our linear function works on a given vector is to project 

143
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,666
that vector onto a line that's perpendicular to both v and w, 

144
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:48,881
then to multiply the length of that projection by the area of the parallelogram 

145
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,120
spanned by v and w.

146
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,616
But this is the same thing as taking a dot product between x, y, 

147
00:10:55,616 --> 00:11:00,734
z and a vector that's perpendicular to v and w with a length equal to the area of 

148
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:01,920
that parallelogram.

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,056
What's more, if you choose the appropriate direction for that vector, 

150
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:11,022
the cases where the dot product is negative will line up with the cases 

151
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:15,320
where the right hand rule for the orientation of x, y, z, v and w is negative.

152
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,317
This means that we just found a vector p so that taking a dot product 

153
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:29,034
between p and some vector x, y, z is the same thing as computing that 

154
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:34,560
determinant of a 3x3 matrix whose columns are x, y, z, the coordinates of v and w.

155
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,089
So the answer that we found earlier computationally using that 

156
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,100
special notational trick must correspond geometrically to this vector.

157
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,127
This is the fundamental reason why the computation and the 

158
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:50,300
geometric interpretation of the cross product are related.

159
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,412
Just to sum up what happened here, I started by defining a linear transformation 

160
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:02,420
from 3D space to the number line, and it was defined in terms of the vectors v and w.

161
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,966
Then I went through two separate ways to think about the dual vector 

162
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:10,867
of this transformation, the vector such that applying the transformation 

163
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:14,020
is the same thing as taking a dot product with that vector.

164
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,998
On the one hand, a computational approach will lead you to 

165
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,710
the trick of plugging in the symbols i-hat, j-hat, 

166
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,540
and k-hat to the first column of a matrix and computing the determinant.

167
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,873
But thinking geometrically, we can deduce that this dual vector 

168
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:33,487
must be perpendicular to v and w with a length equal to the 

169
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:37,040
area of the parallelogram spanned out by those two vectors.

170
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,459
Since both of these approaches give us a dual vector to the same transformation, 

171
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,020
they must be the same vector.

172
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,935
So that wraps up dot products and cross products, 

173
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:54,500
and the next video will be a really important concept for linear algebra, change of basis.
