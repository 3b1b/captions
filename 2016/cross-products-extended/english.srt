1
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:21,160
Hey folks, where we left off I was talking about how to compute a three-dimensional cross

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,560
product between two vectors, v cross w.

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,560
It's this funny thing where you write a matrix whose second column has the coordinates of

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,760
v, whose third column has the coordinates of w, but the entries of that first column,

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,520
weirdly, are the symbols i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat, where you just pretend like those guys

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,000
are numbers for the sake of computations.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,280
Then with that funky matrix in hand, you compute its determinant.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,960
If you just chug along with those computations, ignoring the weirdness, you get some constant

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,240
times i-hat, plus some constant times j-hat, plus some constant times k-hat.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,900
How specifically you think about computing that determinant is kind of beside the point.

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,400
All that really matters here is that you'll end up with three different numbers that are

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,860
interpreted as the coordinates of some resulting vector.

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,180
From here, students are typically told to just believe that the resulting vector has

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,920
the following geometric properties.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,520
This length equals the area of the parallelogram defined by v and w.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,560
It points in a direction perpendicular to both v and w, and this direction obeys the

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,360
right-hand rule, in the sense that if you point your forefinger along v and your middle

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,280
finger along w, then when you stick up your thumb, it'll point in the direction of the

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,140
new vector.

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,960
There are some brute force computations that you could do to confirm these facts, but I

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
want to share with you a really elegant line of reasoning.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,980
It leverages a bit of background though, so for this video I'm assuming that everybody

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,960
has watched chapter 5 on the determinant and chapter 7, where I introduced the idea of

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,800
duality.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,960
As a quick reminder, the idea of duality is that any time you have a linear transformation

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,560
from some space to the number line, it's associated with a unique vector in that space, in the

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,520
sense that performing the linear transformation is the same as taking a dot product with

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
that vector.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Numerically, this is because one of those transformations is described by a matrix with

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:35,400
just one row, where each column tells you the number that each basis vector lands on.

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,760
And multiplying this matrix by some vector v is computationally identical to taking the

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,600
dot product between v and the vector you get by turning that matrix on its side.

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,660
The takeaway is that whenever you're out in the mathematical wild and you find a linear

34
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,380
transformation to the number line, you will be able to match it to some vector, which

35
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,800
is called the dual vector of that transformation, so that performing the linear transformation

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,520
is the same as taking a dot product with that vector.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,640
The cross product gives us a really slick example of this process in action.

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,720
It takes some effort, but it's definitely worth it.

39
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,280
What I'm going to do is define a certain linear transformation from three dimensions to the

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,120
number line, and it'll be defined in terms of the two vectors v and w.

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,320
Then when we associate that transformation with its dual vector in 3D space, that dual

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,320
vector is going to be the cross product of v and w.

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,080
The reason for doing this will be that understanding that transformation is going to make clear

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,160
the connection between the computation and the geometry of the cross product.

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,480
So to back up a bit, remember in two dimensions what it meant to compute the 2D version of

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,040
the cross product?

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
When you have two vectors v and w, you put the coordinates of v as the first column of

48
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,920
a matrix and the coordinates of w as the second column of a matrix.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,880
Then you just compute the determinant.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,940
There's no nonsense with basis vectors stuck in a matrix or anything like that, just an

51
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,020
ordinary determinant returning a number.

52
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,220
Geometrically, this gives us the area of a parallelogram spanned out by those two vectors,

53
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,860
with the possibility of being negative depending on the orientation of the vectors.

54
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,000
Now if you didn't already know the 3D cross product and you're trying to extrapolate,

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,780
you might imagine that it involves taking three separate 3D vectors, u, v, and w, and

56
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,500
making their coordinates the columns of a 3x3 matrix, then computing the determinant

57
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,140
of that matrix.

58
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,320
And as you know from chapter 5, geometrically this would give you the volume of a parallelepiped

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,860
spanned out by those three vectors, with a plus or minus sign depending on the right

60
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,100
hand rule orientation of those three vectors.

61
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,380
Of course, you all know that this is not the 3D cross product.

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,680
The actual 3D cross product takes in two vectors and spits out a vector.

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,720
It doesn't take in three vectors and spit out a number.

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,180
But this idea actually gets us really close to what the real cross product is.

65
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,760
Consider that first vector u to be a variable, say with variable entries x, y, and z, while

66
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,280
v and w remain fixed.

67
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,100
What we have then is a function from three dimensions to the number line.

68
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,160
You input some vector x, y, z, and you get out a number by taking the determinant of

69
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,860
a matrix whose first column is x, y, z, and whose other two columns are the coordinates

70
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,020
of the constant vectors v and w.

71
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,120
Geometrically, the meaning of this function is that for any input vector x, y, z, you

72
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,340
consider the parallelepiped defined by this vector v and w.

73
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,540
Then you return its volume with a plus or minus sign depending on orientation.

74
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,820
Now this might feel like kind of a random thing to do.

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,780
I mean, where does this function come from?

76
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,980
Why are we defining it this way?

77
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,140
And I'll admit at this stage it might kind of feel like it's coming out of the blue.

78
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,160
But if you're willing to go along with it and play around with the properties that this

79
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,760
guy has, it's the key to understanding the cross product.

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,900
One really important fact about this function is that it's linear.

81
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,340
I'll actually leave it to you to work through the details of why this is true based on properties

82
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,480
of the determinant.

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,660
But once you know that it's linear, we can start bringing in the idea of duality.

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,340
Once you know that it's linear, you know that there's some way to describe this function

85
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
as matrix multiplication.

86
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,200
Specifically, since it's a function that goes from three dimensions to one dimension, there

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:53,580
will be a one by three matrix that encodes this transformation.

88
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,780
And the whole idea of duality is that the special thing about transformations from several

89
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,780
dimensions to one dimension is that you can turn that matrix on its side and instead interpret

90
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,740
the entire transformation as the dot product with a certain vector.

91
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,960
What we're looking for is the special 3D vector that I'll call p, such that taking the dot

92
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,800
product between p and any other vector x, y, z gives the same result as plugging in

93
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,920
x, y, z as the first column of a three by three matrix whose other two columns have

94
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,140
the coordinates of v and w, then computing the determinant.

95
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll get to the geometry of this in just a moment, but right now let's dig in and think

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,420
about what this means computationally.

97
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,840
Taking the dot product between p and x, y, z will give us something times x plus something

98
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,920
times y plus something times z, where those somethings are the coordinates of p.

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,320
But on the right side here, when you compute the determinant, you can organize it to look

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,560
like some constant times x plus some constant times y plus some constant times z, where

101
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,440
those constants involve certain combinations of the components of v and w.

102
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,440
So those constants, those particular combinations of the coordinates of v and w are going to

103
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,440
be the coordinates of the vector p that we're looking for.

104
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,660
But what's going on on the right here should feel very familiar to anyone who's actually

105
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,280
worked through a cross product computation.

106
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,340
Collecting the constant terms that are multiplied by x, y, and by z like this is no different

107
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,720
from plugging in the symbols i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat to that first column, and seeing

108
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,080
which coefficients aggregate on each one of those terms.

109
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,720
It's just that plugging in i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat is a way of signaling that we should

110
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,400
interpret those coefficients as the coordinates of a vector.

111
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,680
So what all of this is saying is that this funky computation can be thought of as a way

112
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,220
to answer the following question.

113
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,500
What vector p has the special property that when you take a dot product between p and

114
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,500
some vector x, y, z, it gives the same result as plugging in x, y, z to the first column

115
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,580
of a matrix whose other two columns have the coordinates of v and w, then computing the

116
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,260
determinant.

117
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,540
That's a bit of a mouthful, but it's an important question to digest for this video.

118
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,160
Now for the cool part, which ties all this together with the geometric understanding

119
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,060
of the cross product that I introduced last video.

120
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,720
I'm going to ask the same question again, but this time we're going to try to answer

121
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,840
it geometrically instead of computationally.

122
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,360
What 3D vector p has the special property that when you take a dot product between p

123
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,160
and some other vector x, y, z, it gives the same result as if you took the signed volume

124
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,160
of a parallelepiped defined by this vector x, y, z along with v and w.

125
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,580
Remember the geometric interpretation of a dot product between a vector p and some other

126
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,340
vector is to project that other vector onto p, then to multiply the length of that projection

127
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,940
by the length of p.

128
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,380
With that in mind, let me show a certain way to think about the volume of the parallelepiped

129
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,580
that we care about.

130
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,380
Start by taking the area of the parallelogram defined by v and w, then multiply it not by

131
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,380
the length of x, y, z, but by the component of x, y, z that's perpendicular to that parallelogram.

132
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,460
In other words, the way our linear function works on a given vector is to project that

133
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,980
vector onto a line that's perpendicular to both v and w, then to multiply the length

134
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,900
of that projection by the area of the parallelogram spanned by v and w.

135
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,660
But this is the same thing as taking a dot product between x, y, z and a vector that's

136
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,380
perpendicular to v and w with a length equal to the area of that parallelogram.

137
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,420
What's more, if you choose the appropriate direction for that vector, the cases where

138
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,780
the dot product is negative will line up with the cases where the right hand rule for the

139
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:18,780
orientation of x, y, z, v and w is negative.

140
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,140
This means that we just found a vector p so that taking a dot product between p and some

141
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,540
vector x, y, z is the same thing as computing that determinant of a 3x3 matrix whose columns

142
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,460
are x, y, z, the coordinates of v and w.

143
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,440
So the answer that we found earlier computationally using that special notational trick must correspond

144
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,140
geometrically to this vector.

145
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,060
This is the fundamental reason why the computation and the geometric interpretation of the cross

146
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,020
product are related.

147
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,940
Just to sum up what happened here, I started by defining a linear transformation from 3D

148
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,340
space to the number line, and it was defined in terms of the vectors v and w.

149
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,420
Then I went through two separate ways to think about the dual vector of this transformation,

150
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,220
the vector such that applying the transformation is the same thing as taking a dot product

151
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,900
with that vector.

152
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,100
On the one hand, a computational approach will lead you to the trick of plugging in

153
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,780
the symbols i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat to the first column of a matrix and computing the

154
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,100
determinant.

155
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,740
But thinking geometrically, we can deduce that this dual vector must be perpendicular

156
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,260
to v and w with a length equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned out by those

157
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,460
two vectors.

158
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,940
Since both of these approaches give us a dual vector to the same transformation, they must

159
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,540
be the same vector.

160
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,920
So that wraps up dot products and cross products, and the next video will be a really important

161
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,740
concept for linear algebra, change of basis.

162
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,460
.
