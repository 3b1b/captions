00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
Hey folks, I've got a relatively quick video for you today, just sort of a footnote between

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
chapters.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,240
In the last two videos I talked about linear transformations and matrices, but I only showed

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,240
the specific case of transformations that take two-dimensional vectors to other two-dimensional

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
vectors.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,120
The general throughout this series will work mainly in two dimensions, mostly because it's

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,560
easier to actually see on the screen and wrap your mind around.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,280
But more importantly than that, once you get all the core ideas in two dimensions, they

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,400
carry over pretty seamlessly to higher dimensions.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,480
Nevertheless, it's good to peek our heads outside of flatland now and then to, you know,

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,440
see what it means to apply these ideas in more than just those two dimensions.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,220
For example, consider a linear transformation with three-dimensional vectors as inputs and

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,460
three-dimensional vectors as outputs.

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,260
We can visualize this by smooshing around all the points in three-dimensional space,

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,940
as represented by a grid, in such a way that keeps the grid lines parallel and evenly spaced,

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,580
and which fixes the origin in place.

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,020
And just as with two dimensions, every point of space that we see moving around is really

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,020
just a proxy for a vector who has its tip at that point, and what we're really doing

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,980
is thinking about input vectors moving over to their corresponding outputs.

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,100
And just as with two dimensions, one of these transformations is completely described by

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,240
where the basis vectors go.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,740
But now, there are three standard basis vectors that we typically use, the unit vector in

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,060
the x direction, i-hat, the unit vector in the y direction, j-hat, and a new guy, the

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,260
unit vector in the z direction, called k-hat.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,420
In fact, I think it's easier to think about these transformations by only following those

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,060
basis vectors, since the full 3D grid representing all points can get kind of messy.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,400
By leaving a copy of the original axes in the background, we can think about the coordinates

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,180
of where each of these three basis vectors lands.

29
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,560
Record the coordinates of these three vectors as the columns of a 3x3 matrix.

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,800
This gives a matrix that completely describes the transformation using only nine numbers.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,280
As a simple example, consider the transformation that rotates space 90 degrees around the y

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,920
axis.

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,640
So that would mean that it takes i-hat to the coordinates 0, 0, negative 1 on the z

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,100
axis.

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,000
It doesn't move j-hat, so it stays at the coordinates 0, 1, 0.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,280
And then k-hat moves over to the x axis at 1, 0, 0.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,780
Those three sets of coordinates become the columns of a matrix that describes that rotation

38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,940
To see where a vector with coordinates x, y, z lands, the reasoning is almost identical

39
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,060
to what it was for two dimensions.

40
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,700
Each of those coordinates can be thought of as instructions for how to scale each basis

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,460
vector so that they add together to get your vector.

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,340
And the important part, just like the 2D case, is that this scaling and adding process works

43
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,420
both before and after the transformation.

44
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,660
So to see where your vector lands, you multiply those coordinates by the corresponding columns

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:29,980
of the matrix, and then you add together the three results.

46
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,080
Multiplying two matrices is also similar.

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,220
Whenever you see two 3x3 matrices getting multiplied together, you should imagine first

48
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,860
applying the transformation encoded by the right one, then applying the transformation

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,140
encoded by the left one.

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,180
It turns out that 3D matrix multiplication is actually pretty important for fields like

51
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,580
computer graphics and robotics, since things like rotations and three dimensions can be

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,900
pretty hard to describe, but they're easier to wrap your mind around if you can break

53
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,900
them down as the composition of separate, easier-to-think-about rotations.

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,620
Performing this matrix multiplication numerically is, once again, pretty similar to the two-dimensional

55
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
case.

56
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,980
In fact, a good way to test your understanding of the last video would be to try to reason

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,700
through what specifically this matrix multiplication should look like, thinking closely about how

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:32,660
it relates to the idea of applying two successive transformations in space.

59
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,020
In the next video, I'll start getting into the determinant.
