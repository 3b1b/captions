00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,465
Hey folks, I've got a relatively quick video for you today, 

2
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:18,520
just sort of a footnote between chapters.

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,608
In the last two videos I talked about linear transformations and matrices, 

4
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,683
but I only showed the specific case of transformations that take 

5
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:28,380
two-dimensional vectors to other two-dimensional vectors.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,186
In general throughout the series we'll work mainly in two dimensions, 

7
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:36,060
mostly because it's easier to actually see on the screen and wrap your mind around.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,289
But more importantly than that, once you get all the core ideas in two dimensions, 

9
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,800
they carry over pretty seamlessly to higher dimensions.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,205
Nevertheless, it's good to peek our heads outside of flatland now and then to, 

11
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:51,000
you know, see what it means to apply these ideas in more than just those two dimensions.

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,865
For example, consider a linear transformation with three-dimensional 

13
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,880
vectors as inputs and three-dimensional vectors as outputs.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,046
We can visualize this by smooshing around all the points in three-dimensional space, 

15
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:09,358
as represented by a grid, in such a way that keeps the grid lines parallel 

16
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:12,520
and evenly spaced, and which fixes the origin in place.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,008
And just as with two dimensions, every point of space that we see moving around is 

18
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:21,515
really just a proxy for a vector who has its tip at that point, 

19
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:25,954
and what we're really doing is thinking about input vectors moving over to their 

20
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:27,160
corresponding outputs.

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,925
And just as with two dimensions, one of these transformations 

22
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,560
is completely described by where the basis vectors go.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,680
But now, there are three standard basis vectors that we typically use.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,508
The unit vector in the x direction, i-hat, the unit vector in the y direction, 

25
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:46,560
j-hat, and a new guy, the unit vector in the z direction, called k-hat.

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,426
In fact, I think it's easier to think about these transformations by only following 

27
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:56,020
those basis vectors, since the full 3D grid representing all points can get kind of messy.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,811
By leaving a copy of the original axes in the background, 

29
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:04,000
we can think about the coordinates of where each of these three basis vectors lands.

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,460
Record the coordinates of these three vectors as the columns of a 3x3 matrix.

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,160
This gives a matrix that completely describes the transformation using only nine numbers.

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,614
As a simple example, consider the transformation 

33
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:23,960
that rotates space 90 degrees around the y-axis.

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,100
So that would mean that it takes i-hat to the coordinates 0,0, negative 1 on the z-axis.

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,280
It doesn't move j-hat, so it stays at the coordinates 0,1,0.

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,840
And then k-hat moves over to the x-axis at 1,0,0.

37
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,901
Those three sets of coordinates become the columns of 

38
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,760
a matrix that describes that rotation transformation.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,559
To see where a vector with coordinates x,y,z lands, 

40
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:56,220
the reasoning is almost identical to what it was for two dimensions.

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,540
Each of those coordinates can be thought of as instructions for how to 

42
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,040
scale each basis vector so that they add together to get your vector.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,974
And the important part, just like the 2D case, 

44
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:14,000
is that this scaling and adding process works both before and after the transformation.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,380
So to see where your vector lands, you multiply those coordinates by the 

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,820
corresponding columns of the matrix, and then you add together the three results.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,500
Multiplying two matrices is also similar.

48
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,578
Whenever you see two 3x3 matrices getting multiplied together, 

49
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:40,040
you should imagine first applying the transformation encoded by the right one, 

50
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,260
then applying the transformation encoded by the left one.

51
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,284
It turns out that 3D matrix multiplication is actually pretty important for fields 

52
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:52,660
like computer graphics and robotics, since things like rotations and three dimensions 

53
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,885
can be pretty hard to describe, but they're easier to wrap your mind around if you 

54
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:01,160
can break them down as the composition of separate, easier-to-think-about rotations.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,084
Performing this matrix multiplication numerically is, 

56
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:09,860
once again, pretty similar to the two-dimensional case.

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,724
In fact, a good way to test your understanding of the last video would be to try to 

58
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:18,665
reason through what specifically this matrix multiplication should look like, 

59
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:22,556
thinking closely about how it relates to the idea of applying two successive 

60
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:23,820
transformations in space.

61
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,500
In the next video, I'll start getting into the determinant.
