00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,020
Hey folks, I've got a relatively quick video for you today, just sort of a footnote between

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,520
chapters.

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,300
In the last two videos I talked about linear transformations and matrices, but I only showed

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,860
the specific case of transformations that take two-dimensional vectors to other two-dimensional

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,380
vectors.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,220
In general throughout the series we'll work mainly in two dimensions, mostly because it's

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,060
easier to actually see on the screen and wrap your mind around.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,340
But more importantly than that, once you get all the core ideas in two dimensions, they

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,800
carry over pretty seamlessly to higher dimensions.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Nevertheless, it's good to peek our heads outside of flatland now and then to, you know,

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,000
see what it means to apply these ideas in more than just those two dimensions.

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,280
For example, consider a linear transformation with three-dimensional vectors as inputs and

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,880
three-dimensional vectors as outputs.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,980
We can visualize this by smooshing around all the points in three-dimensional space,

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,520
as represented by a grid, in such a way that keeps the grid lines parallel and evenly spaced,

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,520
and which fixes the origin in place.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,020
And just as with two dimensions, every point of space that we see moving around is really

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,780
just a proxy for a vector who has its tip at that point, and what we're really doing

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,160
is thinking about input vectors moving over to their corresponding outputs.

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,160
And just as with two dimensions, one of these transformations is completely described by

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,560
where the basis vectors go.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,680
But now, there are three standard basis vectors that we typically use.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,820
The unit vector in the x direction, i-hat, the unit vector in the y direction, j-hat,

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,560
and a new guy, the unit vector in the z direction, called k-hat.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,460
In fact, I think it's easier to think about these transformations by only following those

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,020
basis vectors, since the full 3D grid representing all points can get kind of messy.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,200
By leaving a copy of the original axes in the background, we can think about the coordinates

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
of where each of these three basis vectors lands.

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,460
Record the coordinates of these three vectors as the columns of a 3x3 matrix.

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,160
This gives a matrix that completely describes the transformation using only nine numbers.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,960
As a simple example, consider the transformation that rotates space 90 degrees around the y-axis.

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,100
So that would mean that it takes i-hat to the coordinates 0,0, negative 1 on the z-axis.

33
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,280
It doesn't move j-hat, so it stays at the coordinates 0,1,0.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,840
And then k-hat moves over to the x-axis at 1,0,0.

35
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,040
Those three sets of coordinates become the columns of a matrix that describes that rotation

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,760
transformation.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,120
To see where a vector with coordinates x,y,z lands, the reasoning is almost identical to

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,220
what it was for two dimensions.

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,380
Each of those coordinates can be thought of as instructions for how to scale each basis

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,040
vector so that they add together to get your vector.

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,380
And the important part, just like the 2D case, is that this scaling and adding process works

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,000
both before and after the transformation.

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,460
So to see where your vector lands, you multiply those coordinates by the corresponding columns

44
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,820
of the matrix, and then you add together the three results.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,500
Multiplying two matrices is also similar.

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,240
Whenever you see two 3x3 matrices getting multiplied together, you should imagine first

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,720
applying the transformation encoded by the right one, then applying the transformation

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,260
encoded by the left one.

49
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,140
It turns out that 3D matrix multiplication is actually pretty important for fields like

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,700
computer graphics and robotics, since things like rotations and three dimensions can be

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,940
pretty hard to describe, but they're easier to wrap your mind around if you can break

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,160
them down as the composition of separate, easier-to-think-about rotations.

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,460
Performing this matrix multiplication numerically is, once again, pretty similar to the two-dimensional

54
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,860
case.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,960
In fact, a good way to test your understanding of the last video would be to try to reason

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,760
through what specifically this matrix multiplication should look like, thinking closely about how

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,820
it relates to the idea of applying two successive transformations in space.

58
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,520
In the next video, I'll start getting into the determinant.
