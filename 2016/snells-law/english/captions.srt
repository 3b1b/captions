00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,823
So, in my video with Steve Strogatz about the brachistochrone, 

2
00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:08,900
we reference this thing called Snell's Law.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,469
It's the principle in physics that tells you how light bends as 

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:15,520
it travels from one medium into another where its speed changes.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,703
Our conversation did talk about this in detail, 

6
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:22,860
but it was a little bit too much detail, so I ended up cutting it out of the video.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,866
So what I want to do here is just show you a condensed version of that, 

8
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:29,752
because it references a pretty clever argument by Mark Levy, 

9
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:33,680
and it also gives a sense of completion to the brachistochrone solution as a whole.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,940
Consider when light travels from air into water.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,104
The speed of light is a little bit slower in water than it is in air, 

12
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:47,500
and this results in the beam of light bending as it enters the water.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,480
Why?

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,480
There are many ways that you can think about this, 

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,540
but a pretty neat one is to use Fermat's Principle.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,063
We talked about this in detail in the brachistochrone video, 

17
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:01,827
but in short, it tells you that if light goes from some point to another, 

18
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:04,319
it will always do it in the fastest way possible.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,175
Consider some point A in its trajectory in the air, 

20
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:11,700
and some point B on its trajectory in the water.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,620
First you might think that the straight line between them is the fastest path.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,773
The only problem with that strategy though, even though it's the shortest path, 

23
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,340
is that you may be spending a long time in the water.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,791
Light is slower in the water, so the path can become faster 

25
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,780
if we shift things to favor spending more time in the air.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,349
You might even try to minimize the time spent in 

27
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,380
the water by shifting it all the way to the right.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,160
However, it's not actually the best thing to do either.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,125
As with the brachistochrone problem, we find ourselves 

30
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,120
trying to balance these two competing factors.

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,320
It's a problem that you can write down with geometry.

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,036
And if this was a calculus class, we would set up the appropriate 

33
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:52,660
equation with a single variable x, and find where its derivative is zero.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,780
But we've got something better than calculus, a Mark-Levy solution.

35
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,500
He recognized that optics is not the only time that nature seeks out a minimum.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,500
It does so with energy as well.

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,960
Any mechanical setup will stabilize when the potential energy is at a minimum.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,203
So for this light-into-media problem, he imagines putting a rod on the border between 

39
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:20,160
the air and water, and placing a ring on the rod, which is free to slide left and right.

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,490
Now attach a spring from point A to the ring, 

41
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,740
and a second spring between the ring and point B.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,739
You can think of the layout of the springs as a 

43
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,500
potential path that light could take between A and B.

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,496
To finagle things so that the potential energy in the springs equals the amount of time 

45
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:42,793
that light would take on that path, you just need to make sure that each spring has a 

46
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:47,040
constant tension which is inversely proportional to the speed of light in its medium.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,960
The only problem with this is that constant tension springs don't actually exist.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,636
That's right, they're unphysical springs, but there's still 

49
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,980
the aspect of the system wanting to minimize its total energy.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,285
That physical principle will hold even though 

51
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:07,380
these springs don't exist in the world as we know it.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,604
The reason springs make the problem simpler though, 

53
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,520
is that we can find the stable state just by balancing forces.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,201
The leftward component of the force in the top spring has to cancel 

55
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,140
out with the rightward component in the force of the bottom spring.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,573
In this case, the horizontal component in each spring is just the total 

57
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:28,420
force times the sine of the angle that that spring makes with the vertical.

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,726
And from that, out pops this thing called Snell's law, 

59
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:35,380
which many of us learned in our first physics class.

60
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,493
Snell's law says that sine of theta divided by the speed of light stays constant 

61
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:42,949
when light travels from one medium to another, 

62
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:47,078
where theta is the angle that beam of light makes with a line perpendicular to 

63
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,960
the interface between the two media.

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,980
So there you go, no calculus necessary.
