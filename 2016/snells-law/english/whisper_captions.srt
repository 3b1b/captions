00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,000
So, in my video with Steve Strogatz about the brachistochrone, we reference this thing

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,900
called Snell's Law.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,640
It's the principle in physics that tells you how light bends as it travels from one medium

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,520
into another where its speed changes.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,340
Our conversation did talk about this in detail, but it was a little bit too much detail, so

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,860
I ended up cutting it out of the video.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,420
So what I want to do here is just show you a condensed version of that, because it references

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,840
a pretty clever argument by Mark Levy, and it also gives a sense of completion to the

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
brachistochrone solution as a whole.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,940
Consider when light travels from air into water.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,960
The speed of light is a little bit slower in water than it is in air, and this results

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,500
in the beam of light bending as it enters the water.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,480
Why?

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,280
There are many ways that you can think about this, but a pretty neat one is to use Fermat's

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,540
Principle.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,360
We talked about this in detail in the brachistochrone video, but in short, it tells you that if

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,320
light goes from some point to another, it will always do it in the fastest way possible.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,060
Consider some point A in its trajectory in the air, and some point B on its trajectory

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,700
in the water.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,620
First you might think that the straight line between them is the fastest path.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,620
The only problem with that strategy though, even though it's the shortest path, is that

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,340
you may be spending a long time in the water.

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,320
Light is slower in the water, so the path can become faster if we shift things to favor

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,780
spending more time in the air.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,040
You might even try to minimize the time spent in the water by shifting it all the way to

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,380
the right.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,160
However, it's not actually the best thing to do either.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,580
As with the brachistochrone problem, we find ourselves trying to balance these two competing

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,120
factors.

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,320
It's a problem that you can write down with geometry.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,800
And if this was a calculus class, we would set up the appropriate equation with a single

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,660
variable x, and find where its derivative is zero.

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,780
But we've got something better than calculus, a Mark-Levy solution.

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,500
He recognized that optics is not the only time that nature seeks out a minimum.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,500
It does so with energy as well.

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,960
Any mechanical setup will stabilize when the potential energy is at a minimum.

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,920
So for this light-into-media problem, he imagines putting a rod on the border between the air

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
and water, and placing a ring on the rod, which is free to slide left and right.

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,340
Now attach a spring from point A to the ring, and a second spring between the ring and point

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,260
B. You can think of the layout of the springs as a potential path that light could take

41
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,500
between A and B.

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,480
To finagle things so that the potential energy in the springs equals the amount of time that

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,600
light would take on that path, you just need to make sure that each spring has a constant

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,040
tension which is inversely proportional to the speed of light in its medium.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,960
The only problem with this is that constant tension springs don't actually exist.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,720
That's right, they're unphysical springs, but there's still the aspect of the system

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,980
wanting to minimize its total energy.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,560
That physical principle will hold even though these springs don't exist in the world as

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,380
we know it.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,220
The reason springs make the problem simpler though, is that we can find the stable state

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,520
just by balancing forces.

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,240
The leftward component of the force in the top spring has to cancel out with the rightward

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,140
component in the force of the bottom spring.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,520
In this case, the horizontal component in each spring is just the total force times

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,420
the sine of the angle that that spring makes with the vertical.

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,300
And from that, out pops this thing called Snell's law, which many of us learned in our

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,380
first physics class.

58
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,060
Snell's law says that sine of theta divided by the speed of light stays constant when

59
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,260
light travels from one medium to another, where theta is the angle that beam of light

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,960
makes with a line perpendicular to the interface between the two media.

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,520
So there you go, no calculus necessary.
