00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
So, in my video with Steve Strogatz about the brachistochrone, we reference this thing

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,520
called Snell's Law.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,760
It's the principle in physics that tells you how light bends as it travels from one medium

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,340
into another where its speed changes.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,500
Our conversation did talk about this in detail, but it was a little bit too much detail, so

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,540
I ended up cutting it out of the video.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,440
So what I want to do here is just show you a condensed version of that, because it references

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,720
a pretty clever argument by Mark Levy, and it also gives a sense of completion to the

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,880
brachistochrone solution as a whole.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,680
Consider when light travels from air into water.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,040
The speed of light is a little bit slower in water than it is in air, and this results

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,640
in the beam of light bending as it enters the water.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,720
Why?

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,280
There are many ways that you can think about this, but a pretty neat one is to use Fermat's

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Principle.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,320
We talked about this in detail in the brachistochrone video, but in short, it tells you that if

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,720
light goes from some point to another, it will always do it in the fastest way possible.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,100
Consider some point A in its trajectory in the air, and some point B on its trajectory

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,400
in the water.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
First you might think that the straight line between them is the fastest path.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The only problem with that strategy though, even though it's the shortest path, is that

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,900
you may be spending a long time in the water.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,300
The light is slower in the water, so the path can become faster if we shift things to favor

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,380
spending more time in the air.

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,940
You might even try to minimize the time spent in the water by shifting it all the way to

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,940
the right.

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,820
However, it's not actually the best thing to do either.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,540
As with the brachistochrone problem, we find ourselves trying to balance these two competing

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,540
factors.

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,940
It's a problem that you can write down with geometry.

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,720
And if this was a calculus class, we would set up the appropriate equation with a single

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,400
variable x, and find where its derivative is zero.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,880
But we've got something better than calculus, a Mark-Levy solution.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,120
He recognized that optics is not the only time that nature seeks out a minimum.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,200
It does so with energy as well.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,460
Any mechanical setup will stabilize when the potential energy is at a minimum.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,840
So for this light-into-media problem, he imagines putting a rod on the border between the air

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,400
and the water, and placing a ring on the rod, which is free to slide left and right.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,320
Now attach a spring from point A to the ring, and a second spring between the ring and point

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,200
B. You can think of the layout of the springs as a potential path that light could take

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,400
between A and B.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
To finagle things so that the potential energy in the springs equals the amount of time that

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,600
light would take on that path, you just need to make sure that each spring has a constant

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,920
tension which is inversely proportional to the speed of light in its medium.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,480
The only problem with this is that constant tension springs don't actually exist.

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,720
That's right, they're unphysical springs, but there's still the aspect of the system

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,080
wanting to minimize its total energy.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,520
That physical principle will hold even though these springs don't exist in the world as

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
we know it.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,320
The reason springs make the problem simpler though, is that we can find the stable state

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,200
just by balancing forces.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,200
The leftward component of the force in the top spring has to cancel out with the rightward

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,520
component in the force of the bottom spring.

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,500
In this case, the horizontal component in each spring is just the total force times

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,960
the sine of the angle that that spring makes with the vertical.

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,200
And from that, out pops this thing called Snell's law, which many of us learned in our

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,160
first physics class.

58
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,000
Snell's law says that sine of theta divided by the speed of light stays constant when

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,240
light travels from one medium to another, where theta is the angle that beam of light

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,740
makes with a line perpendicular to the interface between the two media.

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,640
So there you go, no calculus necessary.
