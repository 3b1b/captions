1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,480
Hey everyone!

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,160
If I had to choose just one topic that makes all of the others in linear algebra start

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,160
to click, and which too often goes unlearned the first time a student takes linear algebra,

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,780
it would be this one.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,160
The idea of a linear transformation and its relation to matrices.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,860
For this video, I'm just going to focus on what these transformations look like in the

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,920
case of two dimensions, and how they relate to the idea of matrix vector multiplication.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
In particular, I want to show you a way to think about matrix vector multiplication that

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
doesn't rely on memorization.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
To start, let's just parse this term, linear transformation.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Transformation is essentially a fancy word for function.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,480
It's something that takes in inputs and spits out an output for each one.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,440
Specifically, in the context of linear algebra, we like to think about transformations that

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,600
take in some vector and spit out another vector.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,720
So why use the word transformation instead of function if they mean the same thing?

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,920
Well, it's to be suggestive of a certain way to visualize this input-output relation.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,000
You see, a great way to understand functions of vectors is to use movement.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,200
If a transformation takes some input vector to some output vector, we imagine that input

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,840
vector moving over to the output vector.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,360
Then to understand the transformation as a whole, we might imagine watching every possible

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,160
input vector move over to its corresponding output vector.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,720
It gets really crowded to think about all of the vectors all at once, each one as an

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
arrow.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,040
So, as I mentioned last video, a nice trick is to conceptualize each vector not as an

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,200
arrow but as a single point, the point where its tip sits.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,160
That way, to think about a transformation taking every possible input vector to some

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,340
output vector, we watch every point in space moving to some other point.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,820
In the case of transformations in two dimensions, to get a better feel for the whole shape of

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,520
the transformation, I like to do this with all of the points on an infinite grid.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,260
I also sometimes like to keep a copy of the grid in the background just to help keep track

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,020
of where everything ends up relative to where it starts.

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,620
The effect for various transformations moving around all of the points in space is, you've

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,940
got to admit, beautiful.

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,700
It gives the feeling of squishing and morphing space itself.

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,560
As you can imagine though, arbitrary transformations can look pretty complicated.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,820
But luckily, linear algebra limits itself to a special type of transformation, ones

37
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,580
that are easier to understand, called linear transformations.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,820
Visually speaking, a transformation is linear if it has two properties.

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,720
All lines must remain lines without getting curved, and the origin must remain fixed in place.

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,960
For example, this right here would not be a linear transformation, since the lines get

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,260
all curvy.

42
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,900
And this one right here, although it keeps the lines straight, is not a linear transformation,

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,800
because it moves the origin.

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,420
This one here fixes the origin, and it might look like it keeps lines straight, but that's

45
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,700
just because I'm only showing the horizontal and vertical grid lines.

46
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,740
When you see what it does to a diagonal line, it becomes clear that it's not at all linear,

47
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,920
since it turns that line all curvy.

48
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,780
In general, you should think of linear transformations as keeping grid lines parallel and evenly

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,700
spaced.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,300
Some linear transformations are simple to think about, like rotations about the origin.

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,300
Others are a little trickier to describe with words.

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,100
So how do you think you could describe these transformations numerically?

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,700
If you were, say, programming some animations to make a video teaching the topic, what formula

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,900
do you give the computer so that if you give it the coordinates of a vector, it can give

55
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,600
you the coordinates of where that vector lands?

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,900
It turns out that you only need to record where the two basis vectors, i-hat and j-hat,

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,580
each land, and everything else will follow from that.

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,460
For example, consider the vector v with coordinates negative 1, 2, meaning that it equals negative

59
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,200
1 times i-hat plus 2 times j-hat.

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,840
If we play some transformation and follow where all three of these vectors go, the property

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,260
that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced has a really important consequence.

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,920
The place where v lands will be negative 1 times the vector where i-hat landed plus 2

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,180
times the vector where j-hat landed.

64
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,680
In other words, it started off as a certain linear combination of i-hat and j-hat, and

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,720
it ends up as that same linear combination of where those two vectors landed.

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,740
This means you can deduce where v must go based only on where i-hat and j-hat each land.

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,220
This is why I like keeping a copy of the original grid in the background.

68
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,960
For the transformation shown here, we can read off that i-hat lands on the coordinates

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,000
1, negative 2, and j-hat lands on the x-axis over at the coordinates 3, 0.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,660
This means that the vector represented by negative 1 i-hat plus 2 times j-hat ends up

71
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,260
at negative 1 times the vector 1, negative 2 plus 2 times the vector 3, 0.

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:14,720
Adding that all together, you can deduce that it has to land on the vector 5, 2.

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,980
This is a good point to pause and ponder, because it's pretty important.

74
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,100
Now, given that I'm actually showing you the full transformation, you could have just looked

75
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,980
to see that v has the coordinates 5, 2.

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,260
But the cool part here is that this gives us a technique to deduce where any vectors

77
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,580
land so long as we have a record of where i-hat and j-hat each land, without needing

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,800
to watch the transformation itself.

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,940
Write the vector with more general coordinates, x and y, and it will land on x times the vector

80
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:52,020
where i-hat lands, 1, negative 2, plus y times the vector where j-hat lands, 3, 0.

81
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,980
Carrying out that sum, you see that it lands at 1x plus 3y, negative 2x plus 0y.

82
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,180
I give you any vector, and you can tell me where that vector lands using this formula.

83
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,300
What all of this is saying is that a two-dimensional linear transformation is completely described

84
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,320
by just four numbers, the two coordinates for where i-hat lands, and the two coordinates

85
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,140
for where j-hat lands.

86
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,580
Isn't that cool?

87
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,260
It's common to package these coordinates into a 2x2 grid of numbers called a 2x2 matrix,

88
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,060
where you can interpret the columns as the two special vectors where i-hat and j-hat

89
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,620
each land.

90
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,780
If you're given a 2x2 matrix describing a linear transformation and some specific vector,

91
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,420
and you want to know where that linear transformation takes that vector, you can take the coordinates

92
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,900
of the vector, multiply them by the corresponding columns of the matrix, then add together what

93
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,280
you get.

94
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,320
This corresponds with the idea of adding the scaled versions of our new basis vectors.

95
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,080
Let's see what this looks like in the most general case, where your matrix has entries

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
A, B, C, D.

97
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,180
And remember, this matrix is just a way of packaging the information needed to describe

98
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,800
a linear transformation.

99
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,840
Always remember to interpret that first column, AC, as the place where the first basis vector

100
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,660
lands, and that second column, BD, as the place where the second basis vector lands.

101
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,740
When we apply this transformation to some vector x, y, what do you get?

102
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,260
Well, it'll be x times AC plus y times BD.

103
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,440
Putting this together, you get a vector Ax plus By, Cx plus Dy.

104
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,980
You could even define this as matrix-vector multiplication when you put the matrix on

105
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,780
the left of the vector like it's a function.

106
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,300
Then you could make high schoolers memorize this without showing them the crucial part

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,460
that makes it feel intuitive.

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,580
But isn't it more fun to think about these columns as the transformed versions of your

109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,860
basis vectors, and to think about the result as the appropriate linear combination of those

110
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,180
vectors?

111
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,660
Let's practice describing a few linear transformations with matrices.

112
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,580
For example, if we rotate all of space 90 degrees counterclockwise, then I-hat lands

113
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,180
on the coordinates 0, 1, and J-hat lands on the coordinates negative 1, 0.

114
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,340
So the matrix we end up with has columns 0, 1, negative 1, 0.

115
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,720
To figure out what happens to any vector after a 90-degree rotation, you could just multiply

116
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,660
its coordinates by this matrix.

117
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,140
Here's a fun transformation with a special name, called a shear.

118
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,540
In it, I-hat remains fixed, so the first column of the matrix is 1, 0, but J-hat moves over

119
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,320
to the coordinates 1, 1, which become the second column of the matrix.

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,940
And at the risk of being redundant here, figuring out how a shear transforms a given vector

121
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,000
comes down to multiplying this matrix by that vector.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,300
Let's say we want to go the other way around, starting with a matrix, say with columns 1,

123
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,900
2, and 3, 1, and we want to deduce what its transformation looks like.

124
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,740
Pause and take a moment to see if you can imagine it.

125
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,140
One way to do this is to first move I-hat to 1, 2, then move J-hat to 3, 1, always moving

126
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,100
the rest of space in such a way that keeps gridlines parallel and evenly spaced.

127
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,840
If the vectors that I-hat and J-hat land on are linearly dependent, which, if you recall

128
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,700
from last video, means that one is a scaled version of the other, it means that the linear

129
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,800
transformation squishes all of 2D space onto the line where those two vectors sit, also

130
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,060
known as the one-dimensional span of those two linearly dependent vectors.

131
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,200
To sum up, linear transformations are a way to move around space such that gridlines remain

132
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,600
parallel and evenly spaced, and such that the origin remains fixed.

133
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,120
Flightfully, these transformations can be described using only a handful of numbers,

134
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
the coordinates of where each basis vector lands.

135
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,840
Matrices give us a language to describe these transformations, where the columns represent

136
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,280
those coordinates, and matrix-vector multiplication is just a way to compute what that transformation

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,400
does to a given vector.

138
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,000
The important takeaway here is that every time you see a matrix, you can interpret it

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,740
as a certain transformation of space.

140
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,980
Once you really digest this idea, you're in a great position to understand linear algebra

141
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,980
deeply.

142
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,820
Almost all of the topics coming up, from matrix multiplication to determinants, change of

143
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,860
basis, eigenvalues, all of these will become easier to understand once you start thinking

144
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,600
about matrices as transformations of space.

145
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,340
Most immediately, in the next video, I'll be talking about multiplying two matrices

146
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
together.

147
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
See you then!

148
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Thank you for watching!
