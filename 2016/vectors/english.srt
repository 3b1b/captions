1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,420
So it's worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,960
You see, broadly speaking, there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors,

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
which I'll call the physics student perspective, the computer science student perspective,

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,880
and the mathematician's perspective.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,040
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,320
What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing,

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,200
but as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around, and it's still the same vector.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,700
Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional,

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,840
and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,880
For example, let's say you were doing some analytics about house prices,

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,320
and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,820
You might model each house with a pair of numbers,

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,520
the first indicating square footage and the second indicating price.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
Notice the order matters here.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,360
In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors,

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,400
where in this context, vector is pretty much just a fancy word for list,

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,880
and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is two.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,760
The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both these views,

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,600
basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
and multiplying a vector by a number, operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
The details of this view are rather abstract,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,880
and I actually think it's healthy to ignore it until the last video of this series,

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,540
favoring a more concrete setting in the interim.

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,160
But the reason I bring it up here is that it hints at the fact that the ideas of vector addition

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,960
and multiplication by numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,840
But before I talk about those operations,

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,720
let's just settle in on a specific thought to have in mind when I say the word vector.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,120
Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here,

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,760
whenever I introduce a new topic involving vectors,

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,120
I want you to first think about an arrow,

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,120
and specifically, think about that arrow inside a coordinate system,

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,720
like the xy-plane, with its tail sitting at the origin.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,320
This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective,

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,400
where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,080
In linear algebra, it's almost always the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,560
Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space,

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,360
we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view,

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,440
which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system,

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,600
it's worth walking through explicitly,

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,840
since this is where all of the important back and forth happens

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,680
between the two perspectives of linear algebra.

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment,

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,760
you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis,

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,320
and a vertical line, called the y-axis.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,640
The place where they intersect is called the origin,

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,400
which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
After choosing an arbitrary length to represent one,

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,360
you make tick marks on each axis to represent this distance.

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,160
When I want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole,

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,080
which you'll see comes up a lot in these videos,

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,320
I'll extend these tick marks to make grid lines,

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,080
but right now, they'll actually get a little bit in the way.

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,760
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,640
that basically gives instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector,

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,960
at the origin, to its tip.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,080
The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis,

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
positive numbers indicating rightward motion,

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,360
negative numbers indicating leftward motion,

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,360
and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis after that,

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,320
positive numbers indicating upward motion,

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,360
and negative numbers indicating downward motion.

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,040
To distinguish vectors from points,

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,320
the convention is to write this pair of numbers vertically,

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
with square brackets around them.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,000
Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector,

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,640
and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
What about in three dimensions?

71
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,320
Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,

72
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,720
which is perpendicular to both the x and y axes,

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,840
and in this case, each vector is associated with an ordered triplet of numbers.

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,840
The first tells you how far to move along the x-axis,

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,520
the second tells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis,

76
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,400
and the third one tells you how far to then move parallel to this new z-axis.

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,160
Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space,

78
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
and every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,520
All right, so back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers.

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,400
After all, every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,480
Luckily, each one's pretty straightforward to define.

82
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,880
Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing up and a little to the right,

83
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,240
and the other one pointing right and down a bit.

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,320
To add these two vectors, move the second one so that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,360
Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first one

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,320
to where the tip of the second one now sits, that new vector is their sum.

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
This definition of addition, by the way,

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,680
is pretty much the only time in linear algebra where we let vectors stray away from the origin.

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,720
Now, why is this a reasonable thing to do?

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,480
Why this definition of addition and not some other one?

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement,

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,960
a step with a certain distance and direction in space.

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
If you take a step along the first vector,

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,120
then take a step in the direction and distance described by the second vector,

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,520
the overall effect is just the same as if you moved along the sum of those two vectors to start with.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,200
You could think about this as an extension of how we think about adding numbers on a number line.

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,760
One way that we teach kids to think about this, say with 2 plus 5,

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,480
is to think of moving two steps to the right followed by another five steps to the right.

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,640
The overall effect is the same as if you just took seven steps to the right.

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,200
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,960
The first vector here has coordinates 1, 2,

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,840
and the second one has coordinates 3, negative 1.

103
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,560
When you take the vector sum using this tip-to-tail method,

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,840
you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second vector.

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
Walk 1 to the right, then 2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down.

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,320
Reorganizing these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion,

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,160
then do all the vertical motion, you can read it as saying,

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,520
first move 1 plus 3 to the right, then move 2 minus 1 up.

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,560
So the new vector has coordinates 1 plus 3 and 2 plus negative 1.

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,080
In general, vector addition in this list-of-numbers conception

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,760
looks like matching up their terms and adding each one together.

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,600
The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Now this is best understood just by looking at a few examples.

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,160
If you take the number 2 and multiply it by a given vector,

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,640
it means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as when you started.

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,080
If you multiply that vector by, say, one-third,

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,760
it means you squish it down so that it's one-third the original length.

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,480
When you multiply it by a negative number, like negative 1.8,

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,200
then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.

120
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,640
This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of a vector

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,400
is called scaling, and whenever you catch a number, like 2 or one-third or negative 1.8,

122
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,080
acting like this, scaling some vector, you call it a scalar.

123
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,000
In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main things that numbers do is scale vectors,

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,080
so it's common to use the word scalar pretty much interchangeably with the word number.

125
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,480
Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of, say, 2,

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,560
corresponds with multiplying each of its components by that factor, 2.

127
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,000
So in the conception of vectors as lists of numbers, multiplying a given vector by a scalar

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,360
means multiplying each one of those components by that scalar.

129
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,960
You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say that linear algebra topics

130
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,240
tend to revolve around these two fundamental operations,

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

132
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,560
And I'll talk more in the last video about how and why the mathematician thinks

133
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,800
only about these operations independent and abstracted away from however you

134
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
choose to represent vectors.

135
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,720
In truth, it doesn't matter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally being arrows in

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,960
space, like I'm suggesting you do, that happen to have a nice numerical representation,

137
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,360
or fundamentally as lists of numbers that happen to have a nice geometric interpretation.

138
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,120
The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do with either one of these views

139
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,560
than it does with the ability to translate back and forth between them.

140
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,840
It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualize many lists of numbers in a visual

141
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,960
way which can seriously clarify patterns in data and give a global view of what certain operations

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,920
do. And on the flip side, it gives people like physicists and computer graphics programmers

143
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,840
a language to describe space and the manipulation of space

144
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,320
using numbers that can be crunched and run through a computer.

145
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,920
When I do mathy animations, for example, I start by thinking about what's actually going on in

146
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,560
space and then get the computer to represent things numerically, thereby figuring out where

147
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,960
to place the pixels on the screen, and doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra

148
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,160
understanding. So there are your vector basics, and in the next video I'll start getting into

149
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,840
some pretty neat concepts surrounding vectors like span, bases, and linear dependence. See you then!

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,460
you
