1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,220
The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,840
So it's worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,277
You see, broadly speaking, there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors, 

4
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:26,523
which I'll call the physics student perspective, 

5
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:30,100
the computer science student perspective, and the mathematician's perspective.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,400
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,384
What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing, 

8
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:41,736
but as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around, 

9
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:43,160
and it's still the same vector.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,536
Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional, 

11
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:50,040
and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,640
The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,326
For example, let's say you were doing some analytics about house prices, 

14
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,760
and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,445
You might model each house with a pair of numbers, 

16
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:08,680
the first indicating square footage and the second indicating price.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,040
Notice the order matters here.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,912
In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors, 

19
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:19,740
where in this context, vector is pretty much just a fancy word for list, 

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,040
and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is two.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,349
The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both these views, 

22
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:33,694
basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding 

23
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,135
two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number, 

24
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:38,820
operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,806
The details of this view are rather abstract, and I actually think it's healthy to ignore 

26
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:47,940
it until the last video of this series, favoring a more concrete setting in the interim.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,226
But the reason I bring it up here is that it hints at the 

28
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,198
fact that the ideas of vector addition and multiplication by 

29
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,220
numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,972
But before I talk about those operations, let's just settle in 

31
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,040
on a specific thought to have in mind when I say the word vector.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,551
Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here, 

33
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:10,258
whenever I introduce a new topic involving vectors, 

34
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,381
I want you to first think about an arrow, and specifically, 

35
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:17,025
think about that arrow inside a coordinate system, like the xy-plane, 

36
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,900
with its tail sitting at the origin.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,549
This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective, 

38
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,920
where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,896
In linear algebra, it's almost always the case 

40
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:30,320
that your vector will be rooted at the origin.

41
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,606
Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space, 

42
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:37,637
we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view, 

43
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:40,620
which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,198
Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system, 

45
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,655
it's worth walking through explicitly, since this is where all of the important 

46
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,680
back and forth happens between the two perspectives of linear algebra.

47
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,466
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment, 

48
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,580
you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis, and a vertical line, called the y-axis.

49
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,404
The place where they intersect is called the origin, 

50
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:05,520
which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,715
After choosing an arbitrary length to represent one, 

52
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:11,360
you make tick marks on each axis to represent this distance.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,656
When I want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole, 

54
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:20,025
which you'll see comes up a bit in the way, but right now they'll get a 

55
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,360
little bit in the way.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,757
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that basically gives 

57
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:30,160
instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector at the origin to its tip.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,004
The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis, 

59
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:38,256
positive numbers indicating rightward motion, negative numbers indicating leftward 

60
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:42,303
motion, and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis 

61
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:45,121
after that, positive numbers indicating upward motion, 

62
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,580
and negative numbers indicating downward motion.

63
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,191
To distinguish vectors from points, the convention is to write 

64
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,340
this pair of numbers vertically with square brackets around them.

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,660
Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector, 

66
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,680
and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,500
What about in three dimensions?

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,970
Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis, 

69
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,920
which is perpendicular to both the x and y-axes, and in this case, 

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,339
each vector is associated with ordered triplet of numbers.

71
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,903
The first tells you how far to move along the x-axis, 

72
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:23,340
the second tells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis, 

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,680
and the third one tells you how far to then move parallel to this new z-axis.

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,869
Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space, 

75
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:35,560
and every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,100
All right, so back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers.

77
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,780
After all, every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Luckily, each one's pretty straightforward to define.

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,561
Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing up and a little to the right, 

80
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,560
and the other one pointing right and down a bit.

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,879
To add these two vectors, move the second one so 

82
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,680
that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,456
Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to 

84
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:08,740
where the tip of the second one sits, that new vector is their sum.

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,569
This definition of addition, by the way, is pretty much the only time 

86
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,860
in linear algebra where we let vectors stray away from the origin.

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,480
Now, why is this a reasonable thing to do?

88
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,020
Why this definition of addition and not some other one?

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,995
Well, the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement, 

90
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,680
a step with a certain distance and direction in space.

91
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,709
If you take a step along the first vector, then take a step in the direction 

92
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,196
and distance described by the second vector, the overall effect is just 

93
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:44,780
the same as if you moved along the sum of those two vectors to start with.

94
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,251
You could think about this as an extension of 

95
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,460
how we think about adding numbers on a number line.

96
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,521
One way that we teach kids to think about this, say with 2 plus 5, 

97
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:57,960
is to think of moving two steps to the right followed by another five steps to the right.

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,720
The overall effect is the same as if you just took seven steps to the right.

99
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,480
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically.

100
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,698
The first vector here has coordinates 1, 2, and the second one has coordinates 3, 

101
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:12,460
negative 1.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,343
When you take the vector sum using this tip-to-tail method, 

103
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,420
you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second vector.

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,620
Walk 1 to the right, then 2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down.

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,341
Reorganizing these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion, 

106
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,173
then do all the vertical motion, you can read it as saying first 

107
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:38,180
move 1 plus 3 to the right, then move 2 minus 1 up.

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,920
So the new vector has coordinates 1 plus 3 and 2 plus negative 1.

109
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,122
In general, vector addition in this list of numbers conception 

110
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,700
looks like matching up their terms and adding each one together.

111
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,360
The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.

112
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,380
Now this is best understood just by looking at a few examples.

113
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,994
If you take the number 2 and multiply it by a given vector, 

114
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:09,620
it means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as when you started.

115
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,065
If you multiply that vector by, say, one-third, 

116
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,860
it means you squish it down so that it's one-third the original length.

117
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,317
When you multiply it by a negative number, like negative 1.8, 

118
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:26,300
then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,991
This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of 

120
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:36,739
a vector is called scaling, and whenever you catch a number like two or one-third 

121
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:41,140
or negative 1.8 acting like this, scaling some vector, you call it a scalar.

122
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,252
In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main things that numbers do is scale 

123
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:50,820
vectors, so it's common to use the word scalar pretty much interchangeably with the word 

124
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,180
number.

125
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,540
Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of, say, 2, 

126
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,580
corresponds with multiplying each of its components by that factor, 2.

127
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,115
So in the conception of vectors as lists of numbers, 

128
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:07,098
multiplying a given vector by a scalar means multiplying each one of those 

129
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:08,480
components by that scalar.

130
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,644
You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say linear algebra topics tend to 

131
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:17,108
revolve around these two fundamental operations, 

132
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:19,220
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

133
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,879
And I'll talk more in the last video about how and why the 

134
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,336
mathematician thinks only about these operations, 

135
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:29,120
independent and abstracted away from however you choose to represent vectors.

136
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,866
In truth, it doesn't matter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally being arrows 

137
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:37,255
in space, like I'm suggesting you do, that happen to have a nice numerical 

138
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:41,322
representation, or fundamentally as lists of numbers that happen to have a nice geometric 

139
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:42,000
interpretation.

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,024
The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do with either one of these 

141
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,720
views than it does with the ability to translate back and forth between them.

142
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,590
It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualize many lists 

143
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,041
of numbers in a visual way, which can seriously clarify patterns 

144
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,280
in data and give a global view of what certain operations do.

145
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,100
And on the flip side, it gives people like physicists and computer 

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,380
graphics programmers a language to describe space and the computer.

147
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,918
When I do math-y animations, for example, I start by thinking about what's 

148
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:20,116
actually going on in space, and then get the computer to represent things numerically, 

149
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:23,060
thereby figuring out where to place the pixels on the screen.

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,580
And doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra understanding.

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,574
So there are your vector basics, and in the next video I'll start getting into some 

152
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:35,220
pretty neat concepts surrounding vectors, like span, bases, and linear dependence.

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:51,820
See you then!
