1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,220
The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,840
So it's worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,660
You see, broadly speaking, there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors,

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,460
which I'll call the physics student perspective, the computer science student perspective,

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,100
and the mathematician's perspective.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,400
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,820
What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing,

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,040
but as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around,

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,160
and it's still the same vector.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,020
Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional,

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,040
and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,640
The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,280
For example, let's say you were doing some analytics about house prices,

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,760
and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,460
You might model each house with a pair of numbers,

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,680
the first indicating square footage and the second indicating price.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,040
Notice the order matters here.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,880
In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors,

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,020
where in this context, vector is pretty much just a fancy word for list,

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,040
and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is two.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,420
The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both these views,

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,980
basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,820
vectors and multiplying a vector by a number, operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.

24
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,680
The details of this view are rather abstract,

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,500
and I actually think it's healthy to ignore it until the last video of this series,

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,940
favoring a more concrete setting in the interim.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,240
But the reason I bring it up here is that it hints at the fact

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,580
that the ideas of vector addition and multiplication by numbers

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,220
will play an important role throughout linear algebra.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,340
But before I talk about those operations, let's just settle in on a specific thought to have in

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,780
mind when I say the word vector. Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here,

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,660
whenever I introduce a new topic involving vectors, I want you to first think about an arrow,

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,100
and specifically, think about that arrow inside a coordinate system, like the xy-plane,

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,160
with its tail sitting at the origin. This is a little bit different from the physics

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,920
student perspective, where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.

36
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,320
In linear algebra, it's almost always the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,160
Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space,

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,020
we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view,

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,620
which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,720
Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system,

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,460
it's worth walking through explicitly, since this is where all of the important

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,680
back and forth happens between the two perspectives of linear algebra.

43
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,360
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment, you have a horizontal line,

44
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,580
called the x-axis, and a vertical line, called the y-axis. The place where they intersect is

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,520
called the origin, which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.

46
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,680
After choosing an arbitrary length to represent one, you make tick marks on each axis to represent

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,440
this distance. When I want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole, which you'll see comes up a

48
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,960
bit in the way, but right now they'll get a little bit in the way. The coordinates of a

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,020
vector is a pair of numbers that basically gives instructions for how to get from the tail of that

50
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,660
vector at the origin to its tip. The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis,

51
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,840
positive numbers indicating rightward motion, negative numbers indicating leftward motion,

52
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis after that,

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,580
positive numbers indicating upward motion, and negative numbers indicating downward motion.

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,640
To distinguish vectors from points, the convention is to write this pair of numbers

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,860
vertically with square brackets around them. Every pair of numbers gives you one and only

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,680
one vector, and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,940
What about in three dimensions? Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,

58
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,980
which is perpendicular to both the x and y-axes, and in this case, each vector is associated with

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,400
ordered triplet of numbers. The first tells you how far to move along the x-axis, the second tells

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,400
you how far to move parallel to the y-axis, and the third one tells you how far to then move

61
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,640
parallel to this new z-axis. Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space,

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,560
and every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,980
All right, so back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers. After all,

64
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,780
every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,700
Luckily, each one's pretty straightforward to define. Let's say we have two vectors,

66
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,560
one pointing up and a little to the right, and the other one pointing right and down a bit.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,680
To add these two vectors, move the second one so that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,740
Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to where the tip of the second one

69
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,740
sits, that new vector is their sum.

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,340
This definition of addition, by the way, is pretty much the only time in linear algebra

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,860
where we let vectors stray away from the origin. Now, why is this a reasonable thing to do? Why

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,400
this definition of addition and not some other one? Well, the way I like to think about it is

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,100
that each vector represents a certain movement, a step with a certain distance and direction in

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,300
space. If you take a step along the first vector, then take a step in the direction and distance

75
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,440
described by the second vector, the overall effect is just the same as if you moved along the sum of

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,880
those two vectors to start with. You could think about this as an extension of how we think about

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,340
adding numbers on a number line. One way that we teach kids to think about this, say with 2 plus 5,

78
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,960
is to think of moving two steps to the right followed by another five steps to the right.

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,720
The overall effect is the same as if you just took seven steps to the right.

80
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,780
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically. The first vector here has coordinates

81
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:16,100
1, 2, and the second one has coordinates 3, negative 1. When you take the vector sum using

82
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,680
this tip-to-tail method, you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of

83
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,360
the second vector. Walk 1 to the right, then 2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down. Reorganizing

84
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,200
these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion, then do all the vertical

85
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,180
motion, you can read it as saying first move 1 plus 3 to the right, then move 2 minus 1 up.

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,100
So the new vector has coordinates 1 plus 3 and 2 plus negative 1. In general, vector addition

87
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,860
in this list of numbers conception looks like matching up their terms and adding each one

88
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,380
together. The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number. Now this is best

89
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,240
understood just by looking at a few examples. If you take the number 2 and multiply it by a

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,620
given vector, it means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as when you started.

91
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,880
If you multiply that vector by, say, one-third, it means you squish it down so that it's one-third

92
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,940
the original length. When you multiply it by a negative number, like negative 1.8, then the

93
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,240
vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8. This process of

94
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,860
stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of a vector is called scaling,

95
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,340
and whenever you catch a number like two or one-third or negative 1.8 acting like this,

96
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,540
scaling some vector, you call it a scalar. In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main

97
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,520
things that numbers do is scale vectors, so it's common to use the word scalar pretty much

98
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,220
interchangeably with the word number. Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of, say, 2,

99
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,020
corresponds with multiplying each of its components by that factor, 2. So in the conception

100
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,180
of vectors as lists of numbers, multiplying a given vector by a scalar means multiplying each

101
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,700
one of those components by that scalar. You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say

102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,020
linear algebra topics tend to revolve around these two fundamental operations, vector addition

103
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,080
and scalar multiplication. And I'll talk more in the last video about how and why the mathematician

104
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,320
thinks only about these operations, independent and abstracted away from however you choose to

105
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,980
represent vectors. In truth, it doesn't matter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally

106
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,060
being arrows in space, like I'm suggesting you do, that happen to have a nice numerical

107
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,320
representation, or fundamentally as lists of numbers that happen to have a nice geometric

108
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,040
interpretation. The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do with either one of these views

109
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,440
than it does with the ability to translate back and forth between them. It gives the data analyst

110
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,900
a nice way to conceptualize many lists of numbers in a visual way, which can seriously clarify

111
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,020
patterns in data and give a global view of what certain operations do. And on the flip side, it

112
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:10,940
gives people like physicists and computer graphics programmers a language to describe space and the

113
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,860
computer. When I do math-y animations, for example, I start by thinking about what's actually going on

114
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,820
in space, and then get the computer to represent things numerically, thereby figuring out where to

115
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,580
place the pixels on the screen. And doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra understanding.

116
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,720
So there are your vector basics, and in the next video I'll start getting into some pretty neat

117
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,140
concepts surrounding vectors, like span, bases, and linear dependence. See you then!

118
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:51,820
Thank you for watching!
