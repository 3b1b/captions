1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,653
In the last videos I talked about the derivatives of simple functions, 

2
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:22,456
and the goal was to have a clear picture or intuition to hold in 

3
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:26,200
your mind that actually explains where these formulas come from.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,387
But most of the functions you deal with in modeling the world involve mixing, 

5
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:35,176
combining, or tweaking these simple functions in some other way, 

6
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:39,782
so our next step is to understand how you take derivatives of more complicated 

7
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:40,540
combinations.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,995
Again, I don't want these to be something to memorize, 

9
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:47,600
I want you to have a clear picture in mind for where each one comes from.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
Now, this really boils down into three basic ways to combine functions.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,591
You can add them together, you can multiply them, 

12
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,780
and you can throw one inside the other, known as composing them.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,830
Sure, you could say subtracting them, but really that's just 

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,220
multiplying the second by negative one and adding them together.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,164
Likewise, dividing functions doesn't really add anything, 

16
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:14,844
because that's the same as plugging one inside the function, one over x, 

17
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:16,760
and then multiplying the two together.

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,664
So really, most functions you come across just involve layering 

19
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,200
together these three different types of combinations, 

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,440
though there's not really a bound on how monstrous things can become.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,299
But as long as you know how derivatives play with just those three combination types, 

22
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,376
you'll always be able to take it step by step and peel through 

23
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:36,720
the layers for any kind of monstrous expression.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,541
So the question is, if you know the derivative of two functions, 

25
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,774
what is the derivative of their sum, of their product, 

26
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:48,420
and of the function composition between them?

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,260
The sum rule is easiest, if somewhat tongue-twisting to say out loud.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,600
The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of their derivatives.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,700
But it's worth warming up with this example by really thinking through 

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,105
what it means to take a derivative of a sum of two functions, 

31
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:11,170
since the derivative patterns for products and function composition won't 

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,620
be so straightforward, and they're going to require this kind of deeper thinking.

33
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,200
For example, let's think about this function f of x equals sine of x plus x squared.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,212
It's a function where, for every input, you add together 

35
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,960
the values of sine of x and x squared at that point.

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,049
For example, let's say at x equals 0.5, the height of the sine 

37
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,202
graph is given by this vertical bar, and the height of the x 

38
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:42,560
squared parabola is given by this slightly smaller vertical bar.

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,320
And their sum is the length you get by just stacking them together.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,939
For the derivative, you want to ask what happens as you nudge that input slightly, 

41
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,420
maybe increasing it up to 0.5 plus dx.

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,920
The difference in the value of f between those two places is what we call df.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,978
And when you picture it like this, I think you'll agree that the total 

44
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:13,271
change in the height is whatever the change to the sine graph is, 

45
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:18,800
what we might call d sine of x, plus whatever the change to x squared is, dx squared.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,540
We know that the derivative of sine is cosine, and remember what that means.

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,300
It means that this little change, d sine of x, is about cosine of x times dx.

48
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,712
It's proportional to the size of our initial nudge dx, 

49
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:43,360
and the proportionality constant equals cosine of whatever input we started at.

50
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,072
Likewise, because the derivative of x squared is 2x, 

51
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:53,940
the change in the height of the x squared graph is 2x times whatever dx was.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,476
So rearranging df divided by dx, the ratio of the tiny change to 

53
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:04,753
the sum function to the tiny change in x that caused it, 

54
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:10,080
is indeed cosine of x plus 2x, the sum of the derivatives of its parts.

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,329
But like I said, things are a bit different for products, 

56
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,140
and let's think through why in terms of tiny nudges again.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,140
In this case, I don't think graphs are our best bet for visualizing things.

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,040
Pretty commonly in math, at a lot of levels of math really, 

59
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,617
if you're dealing with a product of two things, 

60
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,140
it helps to understand it as some kind of area.

61
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,015
In this case, maybe you try to configure some mental setup 

62
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:39,000
of a box where the side lengths are sine of x and x squared.

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,040
But what would that mean?

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,607
Well, since these are functions, you might think of those sides as adjustable, 

65
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,972
dependent on the value of x, which maybe you think of as this 

66
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,740
number that you can just freely adjust up and down.

67
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,812
So getting a feel for what this means, focus on 

68
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:00,140
that top side who changes as the function sine of x.

69
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,306
As you change this value of x up from 0, it increases up to 

70
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:09,127
a length of 1 as sine of x moves up towards its peak, 

71
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:13,940
and after that it starts to decrease as sine of x comes down from 1.

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,580
And in the same way, that height there is always changing as x squared.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,800
So f of x, defined as the product of these two functions, is the area of this box.

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,120
And for the derivative, let's think about how 

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,180
a tiny change to x by dx influences that area.

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,280
What is that resulting change in area df?

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,116
Well, the nudge dx caused that width to change by some small d sine of x, 

78
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:47,920
and it caused that height to change by some dx squared.

79
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,649
And this gives us three little snippets of new area, 

80
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:58,034
a thin rectangle on the bottom whose area is its width, sine of x, 

81
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:00,260
times its thin height, dx squared.

82
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,407
And there's this thin rectangle on the right, whose area is its height, 

83
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,300
x squared, times its thin width, d sine of x.

84
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,140
And there's also this little bit in the corner, but we can ignore that.

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,857
Its area is ultimately proportional to dx squared, 

86
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:22,480
and as we've seen before, that becomes negligible as dx goes to zero.

87
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,375
I mean, this whole setup is very similar to what I showed last video, 

88
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,700
with the x squared diagram.

89
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,705
And just like then, keep in mind that I'm using somewhat beefy 

90
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:35,900
changes here to draw things, just so we can actually see them.

91
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,818
But in principle, dx is something very very small, 

92
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:44,700
and that means that dx squared and d sine of x are also very very small.

93
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,175
So, applying what we know about the derivative of sine and of x squared, 

94
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:55,660
that tiny change, dx squared, is going to be about 2x times dx.

95
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,580
And that tiny change, d sine of x, well that's going to be about cosine of x times dx.

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,019
As usual, we divide out by that dx to see that the ratio we want, df divided by dx, 

97
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,505
is sine of x times the derivative of x squared, 

98
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:15,700
plus x squared times the derivative of sine.

99
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,260
And nothing we've done here is specific to sine or to x squared.

100
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,360
This same line of reasoning would work for any two functions, g and h.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,311
And sometimes people like to remember this pattern with 

102
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:31,540
a certain mnemonic that you kind of sing in your head.

103
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,680
Left d right, right d left.

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,813
In this example, where we have sine of x times x squared, left d right, 

105
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:43,779
means you take that left function, sine of x, times the derivative of the right, 

106
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,760
in this case 2x.

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,876
Then you add on right d left, that right function, 

108
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:52,940
x squared, times the derivative of the left one, cosine of x.

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,272
Now out of context, presented as a rule to remember, 

110
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:00,020
I think this would feel pretty strange, don't you?

111
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,381
But when you actually think of this adjustable box, 

112
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,820
you can see what each of those terms represents.

113
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,972
Left d right is the area of that little bottom rectangle, 

114
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:15,440
and right d left is the area of that rectangle on the side.

115
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,847
By the way, I should mention that if you multiply by a constant, 

116
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,740
say 2 times sine of x, things end up a lot simpler.

117
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,875
The derivative is just the same as the constant multiplied by 

118
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,520
the derivative of the function, in this case 2 times cosine of x.

119
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,179
I'll leave it to you to pause and ponder and verify that makes sense.

120
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,534
Aside from addition and multiplication, the other common way to combine functions, 

121
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,202
and believe me, this one comes up all the time, 

122
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:52,260
is to shove one inside the other, function composition.

123
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,898
For example, maybe we take the function x squared and shove it 

124
00:08:56,898 --> 00:09:00,460
inside sine of x to get this new function, sine of x squared.

125
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,080
What do you think the derivative of that new function is?

126
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,147
To think this one through, I'll choose yet another way to visualize things, 

127
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:12,540
just to emphasize that in creative math, we've got lots of options.

128
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,591
I'll put up three different number lines, the top one is going to hold the value of x, 

129
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,440
the second one is going to hold the x squared, 

130
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,500
and the third line is going to hold the value of sine of x squared.

131
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,310
That is, the function x squared gets you from line 1 to line 2, 

132
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,500
and the function sine gets you from line 2 to line 3.

133
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,581
As I shift around this value of x, maybe moving it up to the value 3, 

134
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:45,340
that second value stays pegged to whatever x squared is, in this case moving up to 9.

135
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,356
That bottom value, being sine of x squared, is 

136
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,580
going to go to whatever sine of 9 happens to be.

137
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,400
So for the derivative, let's again start by nudging that x value by dx.

138
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,800
I always think that it's helpful to think of x as starting 

139
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,840
at some actual concrete number, maybe 1.5 in this case.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,738
The resulting nudge to that second value, the change in x squared caused by such a dx, 

141
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:15,700
is dx squared.

142
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,063
We could expand this like we have before, as 2x times dx, 

143
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:25,308
which for our specific input would be 2 times 1.5 times dx, 

144
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:30,120
but it helps to keep things written as dx squared, at least for now.

145
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,385
In fact, I'm going to go one step further, give a new name to this x squared, 

146
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:41,200
maybe h, so instead of writing dx squared for this nudge, we write dh.

147
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,260
This makes it easier to think about that third value, which is now pegged at sine of h.

148
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,680
Its change is d sine of h, the tiny change caused by the nudge dh.

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,081
The fact that it's moving to the left while the dh bump is going to the right just 

150
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:05,040
means that this change, d sine of h, is going to be some kind of negative number.

151
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,640
Once again, we can use our knowledge of the derivative of the sine.

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,420
This d sine of h is going to be about cosine of h times dh.

153
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,640
That's what it means for the derivative of sine to be cosine.

154
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,772
Unfolding things, we can replace that h with x squared again, 

155
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:29,780
so we know that the bottom nudge will be a size of cosine of x squared times dx squared.

156
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,480
Let's unfold things even further.

157
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,100
That intermediate nudge dx squared is going to be about 2x times dx.

158
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,446
It's always a good habit to remind yourself of 

159
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,680
what an expression like this actually means.

160
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,578
In this case, where we started at x equals 1.5 up top, 

161
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:54,513
this whole expression is telling us that the size of the nudge on that third 

162
00:11:54,513 --> 00:12:00,755
line is going to be about cosine of 1.5 squared times 2 times 1.5 times whatever 

163
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,220
the size of dx was.

164
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,112
It's proportional to the size of dx, and this 

165
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,920
derivative is giving us that proportionality constant.

166
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,560
Notice what we came out with here.

167
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,856
We have the derivative of the outside function, 

168
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:19,236
and it's still taking in the unaltered inside function, 

169
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:23,220
and then multiplying it by the derivative of that inside function.

170
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,220
Again, there's nothing special about sine of x or x squared.

171
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,502
If you have any two functions, g of x and h of x, 

172
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,264
the derivative of their composition, g of h of x, 

173
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:43,660
is going to be the derivative of g evaluated on h, multiplied by the derivative of h.

174
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,900
This pattern right here is what we usually call the chain rule.

175
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,680
Notice for the derivative of g, I'm writing it as dg dh instead of dg dx.

176
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,235
On the symbolic level, this is a reminder that the thing you plug 

177
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:06,060
into that derivative is still going to be that intermediary function h.

178
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,746
But more than that, it's an important reflection of what 

179
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,520
this derivative of the outer function actually represents.

180
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,449
Remember, in our three line setup, when we took the derivative of the sine on 

181
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:23,900
that bottom, we expanded the size of that nudge, d sine, as cosine of h times dh.

182
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,496
This was because we didn't immediately know how 

183
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,840
the size of that bottom nudge depended on x.

184
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,600
That's kind of the whole thing we were trying to figure out.

185
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,360
But we could take the derivative with respect to that intermediate variable, h.

186
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,916
That is, figure out how to express the size of that nudge on the third 

187
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,680
line as some multiple of dh, the size of the nudge on the second line.

188
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,700
It was only after that that we unfolded further by figuring out what dh was.

189
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,727
In this chain rule expression, we're saying, look at the ratio between a tiny change in 

190
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:02,352
g, the final output, to a tiny change in h that caused it, 

191
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:04,380
h being the value we plug into g.

192
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Then multiply that by the tiny change in h, divided 

193
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,200
by the tiny change in x that caused it.

194
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,482
So notice, those dh's cancel out, and they give us a ratio 

195
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:19,474
between the change in that final output and the change to the input that, 

196
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:22,280
through a certain chain of events, brought it about.

197
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,980
And that cancellation of dh is not just a notational trick.

198
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,351
That is a genuine reflection of what's going on with the 

199
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,900
tiny nudges that underpin everything we do with derivatives.

200
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,878
So those are the three basic tools to have in your belt to handle 

201
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,240
derivatives of functions that combine a lot of smaller things.

202
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,380
You've got the sum rule, the product rule, and the chain rule.

203
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,922
And I'll be honest with you, there is a big difference between knowing 

204
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,551
what the chain rule is and what the product rule is, 

205
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:58,620
and actually being fluent with applying them in even the most hairy of situations.

206
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,101
Watching videos, any videos, about the mechanics of calculus is 

207
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:06,892
never going to substitute for practicing those mechanics yourself, 

208
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:10,400
and building up the muscles to do these computations yourself.

209
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,850
I really wish I could offer to do that for you, 

210
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,440
but I'm afraid the ball is in your court to seek out the practice.

211
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,941
What I can offer, and what I hope I have offered, 

212
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:23,960
is to show you where these rules actually come from.

213
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,774
To show that they're not just something to be memorized and hammered away, 

214
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,264
but they're natural patterns, things that you too could have discovered 

215
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,560
just by patiently thinking through what a derivative actually means.
