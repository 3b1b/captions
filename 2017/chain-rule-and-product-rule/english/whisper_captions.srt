1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,100
In the last videos I talked about the derivatives of simple functions, and the goal was to have

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,260
a clear picture or intuition to hold in your mind that actually explains where these formulas

3
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,980
come from. But most of the functions you deal with in modeling the world involve mixing,

4
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,500
combining, or tweaking these simple functions in some other way, so our next step is to

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,140
understand how you take derivatives of more complicated combinations. Again, I don't

6
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,760
want these to be something to memorize, I want you to have a clear picture in mind for

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
where each one comes from.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,680
Now, this really boils down into three basic ways to combine functions. You can add them

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,420
together, you can multiply them, and you can throw one inside the other, known as composing

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,860
them. Sure, you could say subtracting them, but really that's just multiplying the second

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,340
by negative one and adding them together. Likewise, dividing functions doesn't really

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,480
add anything, because that's the same as plugging one inside the function, one over

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,460
x, and then multiplying the two together. So really, most functions you come across

14
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,960
just involve layering together these three different types of combinations, though there's

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,600
not really a bound on how monstrous things can become. But as long as you know how derivatives

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,140
play with just those three combination types, you'll always be able to take it step by

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,720
step and peel through the layers for any kind of monstrous expression.

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,300
So the question is, if you know the derivative of two functions, what is the derivative of

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,420
their sum, of their product, and of the function composition between them?

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,240
The sum rule is easiest, if somewhat tongue-twisting to say out loud. The derivative of a sum of

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,880
two functions is the sum of their derivatives. But it's worth warming up with this example

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,260
by really thinking through what it means to take a derivative of a sum of two functions,

23
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,760
since the derivative patterns for products and function composition won't be so straightforward,

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,620
and they're going to require this kind of deeper thinking.

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,320
For example, let's think about this function f of x equals sine of x plus x squared. It's

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,940
a function where, for every input, you add together the values of sine of x and x squared

27
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:35,080
at that point. For example, let's say at x equals 0.5, the height of the sine graph

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,100
is given by this vertical bar, and the height of the x squared parabola is given by this

29
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,680
slightly smaller vertical bar. And their sum is the length you get by just stacking

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,320
them together.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,900
For the derivative, you want to ask what happens as you nudge that input slightly, maybe increasing

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,800
it up to 0.5 plus dx. The difference in the value of f between those two places is what

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,040
we call df. And when you picture it like this, I think you'll agree that the total change

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,660
in the height is whatever the change to the sine graph is, what we might call d sine of

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,800
x, plus whatever the change to x squared is, dx squared.

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,460
We know that the derivative of sine is cosine, and remember what that means. It means that

37
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,940
this little change, d sine of x, is about cosine of x times dx. It's proportional

38
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,780
to the size of our initial nudge dx, and the proportionality constant equals cosine of

39
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:48,140
whatever input we started at. Likewise, because the derivative of x squared is 2x, the change

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,940
in the height of the x squared graph is 2x times whatever dx was.

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,400
So rearranging df divided by dx, the ratio of the tiny change to the sum function to

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,160
the tiny change in x that caused it, is indeed cosine of x plus 2x, the sum of the derivatives

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,700
of its parts. But like I said, things are a bit different

44
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,540
for products, and let's think through why in terms of tiny nudges again. In this case,

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,840
I don't think graphs are our best bet for visualizing things. Pretty commonly in math,

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,360
at a lot of levels of math really, if you're dealing with a product of two things, it helps

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,760
to understand it as some kind of area. In this case, maybe you try to configure some

48
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,580
mental setup of a box where the side lengths are sine of x and x squared. But what would

49
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,120
that mean? Well, since these are functions, you might think of those sides as adjustable,

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,140
dependent on the value of x, which maybe you think of as this number that you can just

51
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,020
freely adjust up and down. So getting a feel for what this means, focus on that top side

52
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:05,020
who changes as the function sine of x. As you change this value of x up from 0, it increases

53
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,820
up to a length of 1 as sine of x moves up towards its peak, and after that it starts

54
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,960
to decrease as sine of x comes down from 1. And in the same way, that height there is

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,560
always changing as x squared. So f of x, defined as the product of these

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,100
two functions, is the area of this box. And for the derivative, let's think about how

57
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,280
a tiny change to x by dx influences that area. What is that resulting change in area df?

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Well, the nudge dx caused that width to change by some small d sine of x, and it caused that

59
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,540
height to change by some dx squared. And this gives us three little snippets of

60
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,440
new area, a thin rectangle on the bottom whose area is its width, sine of x, times

61
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,420
its thin height, dx squared. And there's this thin rectangle on the right,

62
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,300
whose area is its height, x squared, times its thin width, d sine of x.

63
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,180
And there's also this little bit in the corner, but we can ignore that. Its area is

64
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,940
ultimately proportional to dx squared, and as we've seen before, that becomes negligible

65
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,100
as dx goes to zero. I mean, this whole setup is very similar to

66
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,700
what I showed last video, with the x squared diagram.

67
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,640
And just like then, keep in mind that I'm using somewhat beefy changes here to draw

68
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,020
things, just so we can actually see them. But in principle, dx is something very very

69
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,700
small, and that means that dx squared and d sine of x are also very very small.

70
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,380
So, applying what we know about the derivative of sine and of x squared, that tiny change,

71
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,800
dx squared, is going to be about 2x times dx. And that tiny change, d sine of x, well

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,580
that's going to be about cosine of x times dx.

73
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,140
As usual, we divide out by that dx to see that the ratio we want, df divided by dx,

74
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:15,700
is sine of x times the derivative of x squared, plus x squared times the derivative of sine.

75
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,520
And nothing we've done here is specific to sine or to x squared. This same line of

76
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,360
reasoning would work for any two functions, g and h.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,640
And sometimes people like to remember this pattern with a certain mnemonic that you kind

78
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,680
of sing in your head. Left d right, right d left.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,420
In this example, where we have sine of x times x squared, left d right, means you take that

80
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,900
left function, sine of x, times the derivative of the right, in this case 2x. Then you add

81
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,420
on right d left, that right function, x squared, times the derivative of the left one, cosine

82
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,940
of x.

83
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,500
Now out of context, presented as a rule to remember, I think this would feel pretty strange,

84
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,620
don't you? But when you actually think of this adjustable box, you can see what each

85
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,380
of those terms represents. Left d right is the area of that little bottom rectangle,

86
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,440
and right d left is the area of that rectangle on the side.

87
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,820
By the way, I should mention that if you multiply by a constant, say 2 times sine of x, things

88
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,520
end up a lot simpler. The derivative is just the same as the constant multiplied by the

89
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,620
derivative of the function, in this case 2 times cosine of x. I'll leave it to you to

90
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,180
pause and ponder and verify that makes sense.

91
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,560
Aside from addition and multiplication, the other common way to combine functions, and

92
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,680
believe me, this one comes up all the time, is to shove one inside the other, function

93
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,420
composition. For example, maybe we take the function x squared and shove it inside sine

94
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,300
of x to get this new function, sine of x squared. What do you think the derivative of that new

95
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,080
function is?

96
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,940
To think this one through, I'll choose yet another way to visualize things, just to emphasize

97
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,820
that in creative math, we've got lots of options. I'll put up three different number

98
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,240
lines, the top one is going to hold the value of x, the second one is going to hold the

99
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,540
x squared, and the third line is going to hold the value of sine of x squared. That

100
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,760
is, the function x squared gets you from line 1 to line 2, and the function sine gets you

101
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,500
from line 2 to line 3.

102
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,600
As I shift around this value of x, maybe moving it up to the value 3, that second value stays

103
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,080
pegged to whatever x squared is, in this case moving up to 9. That bottom value, being sine

104
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,580
of x squared, is going to go to whatever sine of 9 happens to be.

105
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,400
So for the derivative, let's again start by nudging that x value by dx. I always think

106
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,200
that it's helpful to think of x as starting at some actual concrete number, maybe 1.5

107
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,000
in this case. The resulting nudge to that second value, the change in x squared caused

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,920
by such a dx, is dx squared. We could expand this like we have before, as 2x times dx,

109
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,760
which for our specific input would be 2 times 1.5 times dx, but it helps to keep things

110
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,120
written as dx squared, at least for now.

111
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,880
In fact, I'm going to go one step further, give a new name to this x squared, maybe h,

112
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,200
so instead of writing dx squared for this nudge, we write dh.

113
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,340
This makes it easier to think about that third value, which is now pegged at sine of h. Its

114
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,680
change is d sine of h, the tiny change caused by the nudge dh.

115
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,680
The fact that it's moving to the left while the dh bump is going to the right just means

116
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,040
that this change, d sine of h, is going to be some kind of negative number.

117
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,920
Once again, we can use our knowledge of the derivative of the sine. This d sine of h is

118
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,420
going to be about cosine of h times dh. That's what it means for the derivative of sine to

119
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,640
be cosine.

120
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,300
Unfolding things, we can replace that h with x squared again, so we know that the bottom

121
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,780
nudge will be a size of cosine of x squared times dx squared.

122
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,540
Let's unfold things even further. That intermediate nudge dx squared is going to be about 2x times

123
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,100
dx.

124
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,680
It's always a good habit to remind yourself of what an expression like this actually means.

125
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,200
In this case, where we started at x equals 1.5 up top, this whole expression is telling

126
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,840
us that the size of the nudge on that third line is going to be about cosine of 1.5 squared

127
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:03,940
times 2 times 1.5 times whatever the size of dx was. It's proportional to the size

128
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,920
of dx, and this derivative is giving us that proportionality constant.

129
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,220
Notice what we came out with here. We have the derivative of the outside function, and

130
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,740
it's still taking in the unaltered inside function, and then multiplying it by the derivative

131
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,220
of that inside function.

132
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,180
Again, there's nothing special about sine of x or x squared. If you have any two functions,

133
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:38,020
g of x and h of x, the derivative of their composition, g of h of x, is going to be the

134
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,660
derivative of g evaluated on h, multiplied by the derivative of h.

135
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,900
This pattern right here is what we usually call the chain rule.

136
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,300
Notice for the derivative of g, I'm writing it as dg dh instead of dg dx. On the symbolic

137
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,040
level, this is a reminder that the thing you plug into that derivative is still going to

138
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,800
be that intermediary function h. But more than that, it's an important reflection

139
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,520
of what this derivative of the outer function actually represents.

140
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,980
Remember, in our three line setup, when we took the derivative of the sine on that bottom,

141
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:25,580
we expanded the size of that nudge, d sine, as cosine of h times dh. This was because

142
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,560
we didn't immediately know how the size of that bottom nudge depended on x. That's

143
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,600
kind of the whole thing we were trying to figure out.

144
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,400
But we could take the derivative with respect to that intermediate variable, h. That is,

145
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,340
figure out how to express the size of that nudge on the third line as some multiple of

146
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,680
dh, the size of the nudge on the second line. It was only after that that we unfolded further

147
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,700
by figuring out what dh was.

148
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,200
In this chain rule expression, we're saying, look at the ratio between a tiny change in

149
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,880
g, the final output, to a tiny change in h that caused it, h being the value we plug

150
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:10,480
into g. Then multiply that by the tiny change in h, divided by the tiny change in x that

151
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,200
caused it.

152
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,960
So notice, those dh's cancel out, and they give us a ratio between the change in that

153
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,880
final output and the change to the input that, through a certain chain of events, brought

154
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,280
it about.

155
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,920
And that cancellation of dh is not just a notational trick. That is a genuine reflection

156
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,900
of what's going on with the tiny nudges that underpin everything we do with derivatives.

157
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,320
So those are the three basic tools to have in your belt to handle derivatives of functions

158
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,820
that combine a lot of smaller things. You've got the sum rule, the product rule, and the

159
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,380
chain rule.

160
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,280
And I'll be honest with you, there is a big difference between knowing what the chain

161
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,940
rule is and what the product rule is, and actually being fluent with applying them in

162
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,620
even the most hairy of situations.

163
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,380
Watching videos, any videos, about the mechanics of calculus is never going to substitute for

164
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,400
practicing those mechanics yourself, and building up the muscles to do these computations yourself.

165
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,240
I really wish I could offer to do that for you, but I'm afraid the ball is in your

166
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,440
court to seek out the practice.

167
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,160
What I can offer, and what I hope I have offered, is to show you where these rules actually

168
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,040
come from. To show that they're not just something to be memorized and hammered away,

169
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,540
but they're natural patterns, things that you too could have discovered just by patiently

170
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,100
thinking through what a derivative actually means.
