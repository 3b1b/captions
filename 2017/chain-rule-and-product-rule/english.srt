1
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:20,040
In the last videos I talked about the derivatives of simple functions, and the goal was to have

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,280
a clear picture or intuition to hold in your mind that actually explains where these formulas

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,200
come from. But most of the functions you deal with in modeling the world involve mixing,

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,400
combining, or tweaking these simple functions in some other way, so our next step is to

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,280
understand how you take derivatives of more complicated combinations. Again, I don't

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,680
want these to be something to memorize, I want you to have a clear picture in mind for

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,500
where each one comes from.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,380
This really boils down into three basic ways to combine functions. You can add them together,

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,260
you can multiply them, and you can throw one inside the other, known as composing them.

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,920
Sure, you could say subtracting them, but really that's just multiplying the second

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,280
by negative one and adding them together. Likewise, dividing functions doesn't really

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,220
add anything, because that's the same as plugging one inside the function 1 over x

13
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,660
and then multiplying the two together.

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,900
So really, most functions you come across involve layering together these three different

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,060
types of combinations, though there's not really a bound on how monstrous things can

16
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,140
become. But as long as you know how derivatives play with just those three combination types,

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,640
you'll always be able to take it step by step and peel through the layers for any kind

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,460
of monstrous expression.

19
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,220
The question is, if you know the derivative of two functions, what is the derivative of

20
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,520
their sum, of their product, and of the function composition between them?

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,140
The sum rule is easiest, if somewhat tongue-twisting to say out loud. The derivative of a sum of

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,840
two functions is the sum of their derivatives. But it's worth warming up with this example

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,860
by really thinking through what it means to take a derivative of a sum of two functions,

24
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,460
since the derivative patterns for products and function composition won't be so straightforward,

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,740
and they'll require this kind of deeper thinking.

26
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,300
For example, let's think about this function f of x equals sine of x plus x squared. It's

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,220
a function where, for every input, you add together the values of sine of x and x squared

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:35,220
at that point. For example, let's say at x equals 0.5, the height of the sine graph

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,060
is given by this vertical bar, and the height of the x squared parabola is given by this

30
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:48,460
smaller vertical bar. And their sum is the length you get by just stacking them together.

31
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,940
For the derivative, you want to ask what happens as you nudge that input slightly, maybe increasing

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,940
it up to 0.5 plus dx. The difference in the value of f between those two places is what

33
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,080
we call df. And when you picture it like this, I think you'll agree that the total change

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,600
in the height is whatever the change to the sine graph is, what we might call d sine of

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,600
x, plus whatever the change to x squared is, dx squared.

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Now we know that the derivative of sine is cosine, and remember what that means. It means

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,040
that this little change, d sine of x, is about cosine of x times dx. It's proportional

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,800
to the size of our initial nudge dx, and the proportionality constant equals cosine of

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,800
whatever input we started at. Likewise, because the derivative of x squared is 2x, the change

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,160
in the height of the x squared graph is 2x times whatever dx was.

41
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,360
So rearranging df divided by dx, the ratio of the tiny change to this sum function to

42
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,320
the tiny change in x that caused it, is indeed cosine of x plus 2x, the sum of the derivatives

43
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,720
of its parts. But like I said, things are a bit different

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,720
for products, and let's think through why in terms of tiny nudges again. In this case,

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,120
I don't think graphs are our best bet for visualizing things. Pretty commonly in math,

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,320
at a lot of levels of math really, if you're dealing with a product of two things, it helps

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,720
to understand it as some kind of area. In this case, maybe you try to configure some

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,520
mental setup of a box where the side lengths are sine of x and x squared. But what would

49
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,640
that mean? Well, since these are functions, you might think of those sides as adjustable,

50
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,180
dependent on the value of x, which maybe you think of as this number that you can just

51
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,160
freely adjust up and down. So getting a feel for what this means, focus on that top side

52
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,800
who changes as the function sine of x. As you change this value of x up from 0, it increases

53
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,840
up to a length of 1 as sine of x moves up towards its peak, and after that it starts

54
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,920
to decrease as sine of x comes down from 1. And in the same way, that height there is

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,520
always changing as x squared. So f of x, defined as the product of these

56
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,060
two functions, is the area of this box. And for the derivative, let's think about how

57
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:36,060
a tiny change to x by dx influences that area. What is that resulting change in area df?

58
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,580
The nudge dx caused that width to change by some small d sine of x, and it caused that

59
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,620
height to change by some dx squared. This gives us three little snippets of new

60
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,920
area, a thin rectangle on the bottom whose area is its width, sine of x, times its thin

61
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,920
height, dx squared, and this thin rectangle on the right whose area is its height, x squared,

62
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,000
times its thin width, d sine of x. There's also this little bit in the corner,

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,160
but we can ignore that. Its area is ultimately proportional to dx squared, and as we've

64
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,320
seen before, that becomes negligible as dx goes to 0.

65
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,440
This whole setup is very similar to what I showed last video, with the x squared diagram.

66
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,560
And just like then, keep in mind that I'm using somewhat beefy changes here to draw

67
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,000
things so we can actually see them, but in principle dx is something very very small,

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,480
and that means dx squared and d sine of x are also very very small.

69
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,000
So applying what we know about the derivative of sine and x squared, that tiny change dx

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
squared is going to be about 2x times dx, and that tiny change d sine of x is going

71
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,040
to be about cosine of x times dx. As usual, we divide out by dx to see that

72
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,280
the ratio we want, df divided by dx, is sine of x times the derivative of x squared, plus

73
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,760
x squared times the derivative of sine. And nothing we've done here is specific

74
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,660
to sine or to x squared. This same line of reasoning would work for any two functions,

75
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,520
g and h. And sometimes people like to remember this

76
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,140
pattern with a certain mnemonic that you kind of sing in your head, left d right, right

77
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,940
d left. In this example, where we have sine of x times

78
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,700
x squared, left d right means you take that left function, sine of x, times the derivative

79
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,700
of the right, in this case 2x. Then you add on right d left, that right function,

80
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,780
x squared, times the derivative of the left one, cosine of x.

81
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Out of context, presented as a rule to remember, I think this would feel pretty strange, don't

82
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,340
you? But when you actually think of this adjustable box, you can see what each of those terms

83
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:12,340
represents. Left d right is the area of that little bottom rectangle, and right d left

84
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:20,100
is the area of that rectangle on the side. By the way, I should mention that if you multiply

85
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,300
by a constant, say 2 times sine of x, things end up a lot simpler. The derivative is just

86
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,400
the same as the constant multiplied by the derivative of the function, in this case 2

87
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,300
times cosine of x. I'll leave it to you to pause and ponder and verify that makes

88
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,540
sense. Aside from addition and multiplication, the

89
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,260
other common way to combine functions, and believe me, this one comes up all the time,

90
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,340
is to shove one inside the other, function composition. For example, maybe we take the

91
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,660
function x squared and shove it on inside sine of x, to get this new function, sine

92
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,540
of x squared. What do you think the derivative of that new function is?

93
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,980
To think this one through, I'll choose yet another way to visualize things, just to emphasize

94
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,700
that in creative math, we have lots of options. I'll put up three different number lines,

95
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,120
the top one will hold the value of x, the second one will hold the value of x squared,

96
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,460
and the third line will hold the value of sine of x squared, that is, the function x

97
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,680
squared gets you from line 1 to line 2, and the function sine gets you from line 2 to

98
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,300
line 3. As I shift around this value of x, maybe

99
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:44,040
moving it up to the value 3, that second value stays pegged to whatever x squared is, in

100
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,560
this case moving up to 9, and that bottom value, being sine of x squared, is going to

101
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:57,680
go to whatever sine of 9 happens to be. So, for the derivative, let's again start

102
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,280
by nudging that x value by some little dx. I always think it's helpful to think of

103
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,720
x as starting at some actual concrete number, maybe 1.5 in this case. The resulting nudge

104
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,720
to that second value, the change in x squared caused by such a dx, is dx squared.

105
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,240
We could expand this as 2x times dx, which for our specific input would be 2 times 1.5

106
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,160
times dx, but it helps to keep things written as dx squared, at least for now.

107
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,520
In fact, I'm going to go one step further, give a new name to this x squared, maybe h,

108
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,760
so that instead of writing dx squared for this nudge, we write dh.

109
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,120
This makes it easier to think about that third value, which is now pegged at sine of h.

110
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Its change is d sine of h, the tiny change caused by the nudge dh.

111
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,200
By the way, the fact that it's moving to the left while the dh bump is going to the

112
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,860
right just means that this change, d sine of h, is going to be some kind of negative

113
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,360
number. Once again, we can use our knowledge of the

114
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,140
derivative of the sine. This d sine of h is going to be about cosine

115
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,760
of h times dh. That's what it means for the derivative

116
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,840
of sine to be cosine. Unfolding things, we can replace that h with

117
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,880
x squared again, so we know that the bottom nudge is going to have a size of cosine of

118
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,080
x squared times dx squared. In fact, let's unfold things even further.

119
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,680
That intermediate nudge dx squared is going to be about 2x times dx.

120
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,440
It's always a good habit to remind yourself what an expression like this actually means.

121
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,240
In this case, where we started at x equals 1.5 up top, this whole expression is telling

122
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,240
us that the size of the nudge on that third line is going to be about cosine of 1.5 squared

123
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,320
times 2 times 1.5 times whatever the size of dx was.

124
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,360
It's proportional to the size of dx, and this derivative is giving us that proportionality

125
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,080
constant. Notice what we came out with here.

126
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,580
We have the derivative of the outside function, and it's still taking in the unaltered inside

127
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,580
function, and then multiplying it by the derivative of that inside function.

128
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,500
There is nothing special about sine of x or x squared. If you have any two functions,

129
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,500
g of x and h of x, the derivative of their composition, g of h of x, is the derivative

130
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,500
of g evaluated on h, multiplied by the derivative of h.

131
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,660
This pattern is what we usually call the chain rule.

132
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:59,300
For the derivative of g, I'm writing it as dg dh instead of dg dx. On the symbolic

133
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,020
level, this is a reminder that the thing you plug into the derivative is still going to

134
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,200
be the intermediary function h. But more than that, it's an important reflection of what

135
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,100
this derivative of the outer function actually represents.

136
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,820
Remember, in our three line setup, when we took the derivative of the sine on that bottom,

137
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,580
we expanded the size of that nudge, d sine, as cosine of h times dh. This was because

138
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:33,300
we didn't immediately know how the size of that bottom nudge depended on x.

139
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,820
But we could take the derivative with respect to that intermediate variable, h. That is,

140
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,380
figure out how to express the size of that nudge on the third line as some multiple of

141
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,620
dh, the size of the nudge on the second line. It was only after that that we unfolded further

142
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,820
by figuring out what dh was.

143
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,100
In this chain rule expression, we're saying, look at the ratio between a tiny change in

144
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,860
g, the final output, to a tiny change in h that caused it, h being the value we plug

145
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,440
into g. Then multiply that by the tiny change in h, divided by the tiny change in x that

146
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,800
caused it. Notice, those dh's cancel out and give us a ratio between the change in

147
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,860
that final output and the change to the input that, through a certain chain of events, brought

148
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,160
it about.

149
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,640
That cancellation of dh is not just a notational trick, it's a genuine reflection of what's

150
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:37,240
going on with the tiny nudges that underpin everything we do with derivatives.

151
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,280
Those are the three basic tools to have in your belt to handle derivatives of functions

152
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,700
that combine a lot of smaller things. You've got the sum rule, the product rule, and the

153
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,720
chain rule.

154
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,200
And I'll be honest with you, there is a big difference between knowing what the chain

155
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,860
rule is and what the product rule is, and actually being fluent with applying them in

156
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,800
even the most hairy of situations. Watching videos, any videos, about the mechanics of

157
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,900
calculus is never going to substitute for practicing those mechanics yourself, and building

158
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,200
up the muscles to do these computations yourself. I really wish I could offer to do that for

159
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,240
you, but I'm afraid the ball is in your court, my friend, to seek out the practice.

160
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,080
What I can offer, and what I hope I have offered, is to show you where these rules actually

161
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,580
come from. To show that they're not just something to be memorized and hammered away,

162
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,520
but they're natural patterns, things that you too could have discovered just by patiently

163
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,160
thinking through what a derivative actually means.
