1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,800
Now that we've seen what a derivative means and what it has to do with rates

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,240
of change, our next step is to learn how to actually compute these guys. As in, if

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
I give you some kind of function with an explicit formula, you'd want to be able

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,040
to find what the formula for its derivative is. Maybe it's obvious, but I

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,880
think it's worth stating explicitly why this is an important thing to be able to

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,160
do, why much of a calculus student's time ends up going towards grappling with

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
derivatives of abstract functions rather than thinking about concrete rate of

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,040
change problems. It's because a lot of real-world phenomena, the sort of things

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,560
that we want to use calculus to analyze, are modeled using polynomials,

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,440
trigonometric functions, exponentials, and other pure functions like that. So if you

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,720
build up some fluency with the ideas of rates of change for those kinds of pure

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,440
abstract functions, it gives you a language to more readily talk about the

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,120
rates at which things change in concrete situations that you might be using

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,160
calculus to model. But it is way too easy for this process to feel like just

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,560
memorizing a list of rules, and if that happens, if you get that feeling, it's

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,000
also easy to lose sight of the fact that derivatives are fundamentally about just

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,840
looking at tiny changes to some quantity and how that relates to a resulting tiny

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,560
change in another quantity. So in this video and in the next one, my aim is to

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,640
show you how you can think about a few of these rules intuitively and

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,600
geometrically, and I really want to encourage you to never forget that tiny

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,520
nudges are at the heart of derivatives. Let's start with a simple function like

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,400
f of x equals x squared. What if I asked you its derivative? That is, if you were

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,240
to look at some value x, like x equals 2, and compare it to a value slightly bigger,

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,640
just dx bigger, what's the corresponding change in the value of the function, df?

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,960
And in particular, what's df divided by dx, the rate at which this function is

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,680
changing per unit change in x? As a first step for intuition, we know that you can

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,240
think of this ratio df dx as the slope of a tangent line to the graph of x

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,720
squared, and from that you can see that the slope generally increases as x

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,240
increases. At 0, the tangent line is flat and the slope is 0. At x equals 1, it's

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,840
something a bit steeper. At x equals 2, it's steeper still. But looking at graphs

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,560
isn't generally the best way to understand the precise formula for a

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,840
derivative. For that, it's best to take a more literal look at what x squared

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
actually means, and in this case let's go ahead and picture a square whose side

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,960
length is x. If you increase x by some tiny nudge, some little dx, what's the

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,240
resulting change in the area of that square? That slight change in area is

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,280
what df means in this context. It's the tiny increase to the value of f of x

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,960
equals x squared caused by increasing x by that tiny nudge dx. Now you can see

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,440
that there's three new bits of area in this diagram, two thin rectangles and a

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,960
minuscule square. The two thin rectangles each have side lengths of x and dx, so

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,360
they account for 2 times x times dx units of new area. For example, let's say

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,800
x was 3 and dx was 0.01, then that new area from these two thin rectangles would

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:30,240
be 2 times 3 times 0.01, which is 0.06, about 6 times the size of dx. That little

43
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,120
square there has an area of dx squared, but you should think of that as being

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:43,160
really tiny, negligibly tiny. For example, if dx was 0.01, that would be only 0.0001,

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,440
and keep in mind I'm drawing dx with a fair bit of width here just so we can

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,880
actually see it, but always remember in principle dx should be thought of as a

47
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,360
truly tiny amount, and for those truly tiny amounts a good rule of thumb is

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,320
that you can ignore anything that includes a dx raised to a power greater

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,040
than 1. That is, a tiny change squared is a negligible change. What this leaves us

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,920
with is that df is just some multiple of dx, and that multiple, 2x, which you could

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,680
also write as df divided by dx, is the derivative of x squared. For example, if

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,440
you were starting at x equals 3, then as you slightly increase x, the rate of

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,960
change in the area per unit change in length added, dx squared over dx, would

54
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,520
be 2 times 3, or 6, and if instead you were starting at x equals 5, then the

55
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,880
rate of change would be 10 units of area per unit change in x.

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,320
Let's go ahead and try a different simple function, f of x equals x cubed.

57
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,400
This is going to be the geometric view of the stuff that I went through

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,560
algebraically in the last video. What's nice here is that we can think of x

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,760
cubed as the volume of an actual cube whose side lengths are x, and when you

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,400
increase x by a tiny nudge, a tiny dx, the resulting increase in volume is what I

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,200
have here in yellow. That represents all the volume in a cube with side lengths x

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,560
plus dx that's not already in the original cube, the one with side length x.

63
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,720
It's nice to think of this new volume as broken up into multiple components, but

64
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,360
almost all of it comes from these three square faces, or said a little more

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,320
precisely, as dx approaches 0, those three squares comprise a portion closer and

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,720
closer to 100% of that new yellow volume.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,160
Each of those thin squares has a volume of x squared times dx, the area of the

68
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,400
face times that little thickness dx. So in total this gives us 3x squared dx of

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,320
volume change. And to be sure there are other slivers of volume here along the

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,240
edges and that tiny one in the corner, but all of that volume is going to be

71
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,080
proportional to dx squared or dx cubed, so we can safely ignore them. Again this

72
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,720
is ultimately because they're going to be divided by dx, and if there's still

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,160
any dx remaining then those terms aren't going to survive the process of letting

74
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,720
dx approach 0. What this means is that the derivative of x cubed, the rate at

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,280
which x cubed changes per unit change of x, is 3 times x squared.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,920
What that means in terms of graphical intuition is that the slope of the graph

77
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,560
of x cubed at every single point x is exactly 3x squared.

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
And reasoning about that slope, it should make sense that this derivative is high

79
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,400
on the left and then 0 at the origin and then high again as you move to the right,

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,200
but just thinking in terms of the graph would never have landed us on the

81
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,000
precise quantity 3x squared. For that we had to take a much more direct look at

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,360
what x cubed actually means.

83
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,760
Now in practice you wouldn't necessarily think of the square every

84
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,320
time you're taking the derivative of x squared, nor would you necessarily think

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,480
of this cube whenever you're taking the derivative of x cubed. Both of them fall

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,160
under a pretty recognizable pattern for polynomial terms. The derivative of x to

87
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,680
the fourth turns out to be 4x cubed, the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to

88
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,600
the fourth, and so on.

89
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,240
Abstractly you'd write this as the derivative of x to the n for any power n

90
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,240
is n times x to the n minus 1.

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,240
This right here is what's known in the business as the power rule. In practice

92
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,760
we all quickly just get jaded and think about this symbolically as the exponent

93
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,120
hopping down in front leaving behind one less than itself,

94
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,680
rarely pausing to think about the geometric delights that underlie these

95
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
derivatives.

96
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,720
That's the kind of thing that happens when these tend to fall in the middle of

97
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,400
much longer computations.

98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
But rather than chucking it all off to symbolic patterns let's just take a

99
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,640
moment and think about why this works for powers beyond just 2 and 3. When you

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,880
nudge that input x, increasing it slightly to x plus dx, working out the

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,480
exact value of that nudged output would involve multiplying together these n

102
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,440
separate x plus dx terms. The full expansion would be really complicated

103
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,000
but part of the point of derivatives is that most of that complication can be

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
ignored.

105
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,080
The first term in your expansion is x to the n. This is analogous to the area of

106
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,880
the original square or the volume of the original cube from our previous examples.

107
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,040
For the next terms in the expansion you can choose mostly x's with a single dx.

108
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,920
Since there are n different parentheticals from which you could have

109
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,240
chosen that single dx, this gives us n separate terms, all of which include n

110
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,720
minus 1 x's times a dx, giving a value of x to the power n minus 1 times dx. This

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,720
is analogous to how the majority of the new area in the square came from those

112
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,400
two bars, each with area x times dx, or how the bulk of the new volume in the

113
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,400
cube came from those three thin squares, each of which had a volume of x squared

114
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,240
times dx. There will be many other terms at this expansion but all of them are

115
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
just going to be some multiple of dx squared so we can safely ignore them, and

116
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
what that means is that all but a negligible portion of the increase in

117
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,360
the output comes from n copies of this x to the n minus 1 times dx. That's what

118
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,200
it means for the derivative of x to the n to be n times x to the n minus 1. And

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,440
even though like I said in practice you'll find yourself performing this

120
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,400
derivative quickly and symbolically, imagining the exponent hopping down to

121
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,480
the front, every now and then it's nice to just step back and remember why these

122
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,800
rules work. Not just because it's pretty and not just because it helps remind us

123
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,080
that math actually makes sense and isn't just a pile of formulas to

124
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,360
memorize, but because it flexes that very important muscle of thinking about

125
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,600
derivatives in terms of tiny nudges. As another example think of the function f

126
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,200
of x equals 1 divided by x. Now on the one hand you could just blindly try

127
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,800
applying the power rule since 1 divided by x is the same as writing x to the

128
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,680
negative 1. That would involve letting the negative 1 hop down in front leaving

129
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,360
behind 1 less than itself which is negative 2. But let's have some fun and

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,600
see if we can reason about this geometrically rather than just plugging

131
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,280
it through some formula. The value 1 over x is asking what number multiplied by x

132
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,720
equals 1. So here's how I'd like to visualize it. Imagine a little rectangular

133
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,200
puddle of water sitting in two dimensions whose area is 1. And let's

134
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,160
say that its width is x which means that the height has to be 1 over x since the

135
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,600
total area of it is 1. So if x was stretched out to 2 then that height is

136
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,360
forced down to 1 half. And if you increased x up to 3 then the other side

137
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,000
has to be squished down to 1 third. This is a nice way to think about the graph

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,960
of 1 over x by the way. If you think of this width x of the puddle as being in

139
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,240
the xy plane then that corresponding output 1 divided by x, the height of the

140
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,440
graph above that point, is whatever the height of your puddle has to be to

141
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,600
maintain an area of 1. So with this visual in mind for the derivative

142
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,200
imagine nudging up that value of x by some tiny amount, some tiny dx. How must

143
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,240
the height of this rectangle change so that the area of the puddle remains

144
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,320
constant at 1? That is increasing the width by dx adds some new area to the

145
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,980
right here. So the puddle has to decrease in height by some d 1 over x so that the

146
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,740
area lost off of that top cancels out the area gained. You should think of that

147
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,300
d 1 over x as being a negative amount by the way since it's decreasing the

148
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,180
height of the rectangle. And you know what? I'm gonna leave the last few steps

149
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,940
here for you, for you to pause and ponder and work out an ultimate expression. And

150
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,300
once you reason out what d of 1 over x divided by dx should be I want you to

151
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,420
compare it to what you would have gotten if you had just blindly applied the

152
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,620
power rule purely symbolically to x to the negative 1.

153
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,380
And while I'm encouraging you to pause and ponder here's another fun challenge

154
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,180
if you're feeling up to it. See if you can reason through what the derivative

155
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,900
of the square root of x should be.

156
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,620
To finish things off I want to tackle one more type of function, trigonometric

157
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,900
functions, and in particular let's focus on the sine function. So for this section

158
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,100
I'm going to assume that you're already familiar with how to think about trig

159
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,660
functions using the unit circle, the circle with a radius 1 centered at the

160
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,660
origin. For a given value of theta like say 0.8 you imagine yourself walking

161
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,580
around the circle starting from the rightmost point until you've traversed

162
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,700
that distance of 0.8 in arc length. This is the same thing as saying that the

163
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,460
angle right here is exactly theta radians since the circle has a radius of

164
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,700
1. Then what sine of theta means is the height of that point above the x-axis,

165
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,100
and as your theta value increases and you walk around the circle your height

166
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,300
bobs up and down between negative 1 and 1. So when you graph sine of theta versus

167
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:38,300
theta you get this wave pattern, the quintessential wave pattern. And just

168
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,700
from looking at this graph we can start to get a feel for the shape of the

169
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,540
derivative of the sine. The slope at 0 is something positive since sine of theta

170
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,900
is increasing there, and as we move to the right and sine of theta approaches

171
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,380
its peak that slope goes down to 0. Then the slope is negative for a little while

172
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,180
while the sine is decreasing before coming back up to 0 as the sine graph

173
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,020
levels out. And as you continue thinking this through and drawing it out if

174
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,860
you're familiar with the graph of trig functions you might guess that this

175
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,260
derivative graph should be exactly cosine of theta since all the peaks and

176
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,420
valleys line up perfectly with where the peaks and valleys for the cosine

177
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,180
function should be. And spoiler alert the derivative is in fact the cosine of

178
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,260
theta, but aren't you a little curious about why it's precisely cosine of theta?

179
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,140
I mean you could have all sorts of functions with peaks and valleys at the

180
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,100
same points that have roughly the same shape, but who knows maybe the derivative

181
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,700
of sine could have turned out to be some entirely new type of function that just

182
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
happens to have a similar shape.

183
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,580
Well just like the previous examples a more exact understanding of the

184
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,620
derivative requires looking at what the function actually represents rather than

185
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,100
looking at the graph of the function. So think back to that walk around the unit

186
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,420
circle having traversed an arc with length theta and thinking about sine of

187
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,420
theta as the height of that point.

188
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Now zoom into that point on the circle and consider a slight nudge of d theta

189
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,540
along their circumference, a tiny step in your walk around the unit circle.

190
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,500
How much does that tiny step change the sine of theta?

191
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,780
How much does this increase d theta of arc length increase the height above the

192
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,300
x-axis?

193
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,100
Well zoomed in close enough the circle basically looks like a straight line in

194
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
this neighborhood.

195
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,940
So let's go ahead and think of this right triangle where the hypotenuse of

196
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,700
that right triangle represents the nudge d theta along the circumference, and that

197
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,300
left side here represents the change in height, the resulting d sine of theta.

198
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Now this tiny triangle is actually similar to this larger triangle here

199
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,500
with the defining angle theta and whose hypotenuse is the radius of the circle

200
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,700
with length 1.

201
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,860
Specifically this little angle right here is precisely equal to theta radians.

202
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,420
Now think about what the derivative of sine is supposed to mean.

203
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,220
It's the ratio between that d sine of theta, the tiny change to the height,

204
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,940
divided by d theta, the tiny change to the input of the function. And from the

205
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,100
picture we can see that that's the ratio between the length of the side adjacent

206
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,100
to the angle theta divided by the hypotenuse.

207
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,860
Well let's see, adjacent divided by hypotenuse, that's exactly what the

208
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
cosine of theta means, that's the definition of the cosine.

209
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,580
So this gives us two different really nice ways of thinking about how the

210
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,980
derivative of sine is cosine. One of them is looking at the graph and getting a

211
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,780
loose feel for the shape of things based on thinking about the slope of the sine

212
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,820
graph at every single point. And the other is a more precise line of

213
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,820
reasoning looking at the unit circle itself.

214
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,580
For those of you that like to pause and ponder, see if you can try a similar line

215
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,020
of reasoning to find what the derivative of the cosine of theta should be.

216
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,780
In the next video I'll talk about how you can take derivatives of functions

217
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,060
who combine simple functions like these ones, either as sums or products or

218
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,100
function compositions, things like that. And similar to this video the goal is

219
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,460
going to be to understand each one geometrically in a way that makes it

220
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,460
intuitively reasonable and somewhat more memorable.
