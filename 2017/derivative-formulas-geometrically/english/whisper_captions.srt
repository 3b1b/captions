1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,780
Now that we've seen what a derivative means and what it has to do with rates

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,260
of change, our next step is to learn how to actually compute these guys. As in, if

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,640
I give you some kind of function with an explicit formula, you'd want to be able

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,120
to find what the formula for its derivative is. Maybe it's obvious, but I

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,000
think it's worth stating explicitly why this is an important thing to be able to

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,180
do, why much of a calculus student's time ends up going towards grappling with

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,300
derivatives of abstract functions rather than thinking about concrete rate of

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,100
change problems. It's because a lot of real-world phenomena, the sort of things

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,580
that we want to use calculus to analyze, are modeled using polynomials,

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,500
trigonometric functions, exponentials, and other pure functions like that. So if you

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,720
build up some fluency with the ideas of rates of change for those kinds of pure

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,460
abstract functions, it gives you a language to more readily talk about the

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,180
rates at which things change in concrete situations that you might be using

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,160
calculus to model. But it is way too easy for this process to feel like just

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,620
memorizing a list of rules, and if that happens, if you get that feeling, it's

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,000
also easy to lose sight of the fact that derivatives are fundamentally about just

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,880
looking at tiny changes to some quantity and how that relates to a resulting tiny

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,660
change in another quantity. So in this video and in the next one, my aim is to

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,740
show you how you can think about a few of these rules intuitively and

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,660
geometrically, and I really want to encourage you to never forget that tiny

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,740
nudges are at the heart of derivatives.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
Let's start with a simple function like f of x equals x squared.

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,720
What if I asked you its derivative? That is, if you were to look at some value x,

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,620
like x equals 2, and compare it to a value slightly bigger, just dx bigger,

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,840
what's the corresponding change in the value of the function? dF. And in

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,400
particular, what's dF divided by dx, the rate at which this function is changing

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,020
per unit change in x. As a first step for intuition, we know that you can think of

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,540
this ratio dF dx as the slope of a tangent line to the graph of x squared,

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,000
and from that you can see that the slope generally increases as x increases. At

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,920
zero, the tangent line is flat, and the slope is zero. At x equals 1,

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,980
it's something a bit steeper. At x equals 2, it's steeper still. But looking at graphs

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,700
isn't generally the best way to understand the precise formula for a

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,800
derivative. For that, it's best to take a more literal look at what x squared

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,100
actually means, and in this case let's go ahead and picture a square whose side

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,840
length is x.

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,000
If you increase x by some tiny nudge, some little dx,

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,780
what's the resulting change in the area of that square? That slight change in

38
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,840
area is what dF means in this context. It's the tiny increase to the value of

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,480
f of x equals x squared, caused by increasing x by that tiny nudge dx. Now

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,420
you can see that there's three new bits of area in this diagram, two thin

41
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,960
rectangles and a minuscule square. The two thin rectangles each have side

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:18,760
lengths of x and dx, so they account for 2 times x times dx units of new area. For

43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,140
that new area from these two thin rectangles would be 2 times 3 times 0.01,

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,380
which is 0.06, about 6 times the size of dx. That little square there has an area

45
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,480
of dx squared, but you should think of that as being really tiny, negligibly

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,480
tiny. For example, if dx was 0.01, that would be only 0.0001, and keep in mind

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm drawing dx with a fair bit of width here just so we can actually see it, but

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,240
always remember in principle, dx should be thought of as a truly tiny amount, and

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,620
for those truly tiny amounts, a good rule of thumb is that you can ignore anything

50
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,760
that includes a dx raised to a power greater than 1. That is, a tiny change

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,960
squared is a negligible change. What this leaves us with is that dF is just some

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,320
multiple of dx, and that multiple 2x, which you could also write as dF divided

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,800
by dx, is the derivative of x squared. For example, if you were starting at x

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,180
equals 3, then as you slightly increase x, the rate of change in the area per unit

55
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,900
change in length added, dx squared over dx, would be 2 times 3, or 6, and if

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,820
instead you were starting at x equals 5, then the rate of change would be 10

57
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,980
units of area per unit change in x.

58
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,420
Let's go ahead and try a different simple function, f of x equals x cubed.

59
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,520
This is going to be the geometric view of the stuff that I went through

60
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,620
algebraically in the last video. What's nice here is that we can think of x

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,820
cubed as the volume of an actual cube whose side lengths are x, and when you

62
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,440
increase x by a tiny nudge, a tiny dx, the resulting increase in volume is what I

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,220
have here in yellow. That represents all the volume in a cube with side lengths x

64
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,580
plus dx that's not already in the original cube, the one with side length x.

65
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,700
It's nice to think of this new volume as broken up into multiple components, but

66
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,400
almost all of it comes from these three square faces, or said a little more

67
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,320
precisely, as dx approaches 0, those three squares comprise a portion closer and

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,780
closer to 100% of that new yellow volume.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,220
Each of those thin squares has a volume of x squared times dx, the area of the

70
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,460
face times that little thickness dx. So in total this gives us 3x squared dx of

71
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,400
volume change. And to be sure there are other slivers of volume here along the

72
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,260
edges and that tiny one in the corner, but all of that volume is going to be

73
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,080
proportional to dx squared, or dx cubed, so we can safely ignore them. Again this

74
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,780
is ultimately because they're going to be divided by dx, and if there's still

75
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,780
any dx remaining then those terms aren't going to survive the process of

76
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,560
letting dx approach 0. What this means is that the derivative of x cubed, the rate

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,200
at which x cubed changes per unit change of x, is 3 times x squared.

78
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,920
What that means in terms of graphical intuition is that the slope of the graph

79
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,600
of x cubed at every single point x is exactly 3x squared.

80
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,900
And reasoning about that slope, it should make sense that this derivative is high

81
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,460
on the left and then 0 at the origin and then high again as you move to the right,

82
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,360
but just thinking in terms of the graph would never have landed us on the

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,100
precise quantity 3x squared. For that we had to take a much more direct look at

84
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,060
what x cubed actually means.

85
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,800
Now in practice you wouldn't necessarily think of the square every

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,440
time you're taking the derivative of x squared, nor would you necessarily think

87
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
of this cube whenever you're taking the derivative of x cubed. Both of them fall

88
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,220
under a pretty recognizable pattern for polynomial terms. The derivative of x to

89
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,740
the fourth turns out to be 4x cubed, the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to

90
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,760
the fourth, and so on.

91
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,980
Abstractly you'd write this as the derivative of x to the n for any power

92
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,120
n is n times x to the n minus 1. This right here is what's known in the

93
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,720
business as the power rule. In practice we all quickly just get jaded and think

94
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,000
about this symbolically as the exponent hopping down in front, leaving behind one

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,920
less than itself, rarely pausing to think about the geometric delights that

96
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,820
underlie these derivatives. That's the kind of thing that happens when these

97
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,140
tend to fall in the middle of much longer computations. But rather than

98
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,460
tracking it all off to symbolic patterns, let's just take a moment and think about

99
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,160
why this works for powers beyond just 2 and 3. When you nudge that input x,

100
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,080
increasing it slightly to x plus dx, working out the exact value of that

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,060
nudged output would involve multiplying together these n separate x plus dx

102
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,380
terms. The full expansion would be really complicated, but part of the point of

103
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,020
derivatives is that most of that complication can be ignored. The first

104
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,360
term in your expansion is x to the n. This is analogous to the area of the

105
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,920
original square, or the volume of the original cube from our previous examples.

106
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,040
For the next terms in the expansion you can choose mostly x's with a single dx.

107
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,000
Since there are n different parentheticals from which you could have

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
chosen that single dx, this gives us n separate terms, all of which include

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,640
n minus 1 x's times a dx, giving a value of x to the power n minus 1 times dx.

110
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,600
This is analogous to how the majority of the new area in the square came from

111
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,380
those two bars, each with area x times dx, or how the bulk of the new volume in

112
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,020
the cube came from those three thin squares, each of which had a volume of x

113
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,940
squared times dx. There will be many other terms of this expansion, but all of

114
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,880
them are just going to be some multiple of dx squared, so we can safely ignore

115
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,340
them, and what that means is that all but a negligible portion of the increase in

116
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,380
the output comes from n copies of this x to the n minus 1 times dx. That's what

117
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:39,220
it means for the derivative of x to the n to be n times x to the n minus 1. And

118
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,540
even though, like I said in practice, you'll find yourself performing this

119
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,440
derivative quickly and symbolically, imagining the exponent hopping down to

120
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,560
the front, every now and then it's nice to just step back and remember why these

121
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,920
rules work. Not just because it's pretty, and not just because it helps remind us

122
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,340
that math actually makes sense and isn't just a pile of formulas to memorize, but

123
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,480
because it flexes that very important muscle of thinking about derivatives in

124
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,560
terms of tiny nudges.

125
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,440
As another example, think of the function f of x equals 1 divided by x. Now on the

126
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,500
hand you could just blindly try applying the power rule, since 1 divided by x is

127
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,800
the same as writing x to the negative 1. That would involve letting the negative

128
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,440
1 hop down in front, leaving behind 1 less than itself, which is negative 2.

129
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,480
But let's have some fun and see if we can reason about this geometrically,

130
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,120
rather than just plugging it through some formula. The value 1 over x is asking

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,820
what number multiplied by x equals 1. So here's how I'd like to visualize it.

132
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,180
Imagine a little rectangular puddle of water sitting in two dimensions whose

133
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,620
area is 1. And let's say that its width is x, which means that the height has to

134
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,980
be 1 over x, since the total area of it is 1. So if x was stretched out to 2, then

135
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,000
that height is forced down to 1 half. And if you increased x up to 3, then the

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
other side has to be squished down to 1 third.

137
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,640
This is a nice way to think about the graph of 1 over x, by the way. If you

138
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,820
think of this width x of the puddle as being in the xy-plane, then that

139
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,240
corresponding output 1 divided by x, the height of the graph above that point, is

140
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,940
whatever the height of your puddle has to be to maintain an area of 1.

141
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,660
So with this visual in mind, for the derivative, imagine nudging up that value

142
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,540
of x by some tiny amount, some tiny dx. How must the height of this rectangle

143
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,400
change so that the area of the puddle remains constant at 1? That is, increasing

144
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,220
the width by dx adds some new area to the right here. So the puddle has to

145
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,820
decrease in height by some d 1 over x, so that the area lost off of that top

146
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,480
cancels out the area gained. You should think of that d 1 over x as being a

147
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,320
negative amount, by the way, since it's decreasing the height of the rectangle.

148
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,420
And you know what? I'm going to leave the last few steps here for you, for you

149
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,280
to pause and ponder and work out an ultimate expression. And once you reason

150
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,980
out what d of 1 over x divided by dx should be, I want you to compare it to

151
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,020
what you would have gotten if you had just blindly applied the power rule,

152
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,820
purely symbolically, to x to the negative 1.

153
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,360
And while I'm encouraging you to pause and ponder, here's another fun challenge

154
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,420
if you're feeling up to it. See if you can reason through what the derivative of

155
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
the square root of x should be.

156
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,560
To finish things off, I want to tackle one more type of function,

157
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,780
trigonometric functions, and in particular let's focus on the sine

158
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,900
function. So for this section I'm going to assume that you're already familiar

159
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,300
with how to think about trig functions using the unit circle, the circle with a

160
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,600
radius 1 centered at the origin. For a given value of theta, like say 0.8, you

161
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,260
imagine yourself walking around the circle starting from the rightmost point

162
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,060
until you've traversed that distance of 0.8 in arc length. This is the same thing

163
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,640
as saying that the angle right here is exactly theta radians, since the circle

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,600
has a radius of 1. Then what sine of theta means is the height of that point

165
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,300
above the x-axis, and as your theta value increases and you walk around the circle

166
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,240
your height bobs up and down between negative 1 and 1.

167
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,100
So when you graph sine of theta versus theta you get this wave pattern, the

168
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,660
quintessential wave pattern.

169
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,640
And just from looking at this graph we can start to get a feel for the shape of

170
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,320
the derivative of the sine. The slope at 0 is something positive since sine of

171
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,820
theta is increasing there, and as we move to the right and sine of theta approaches

172
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,580
its peak that slope goes down to 0. Then the slope is negative for a little while,

173
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,180
while the sine is decreasing before coming back up to 0 as the sine graph

174
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,080
levels out.

175
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,480
And as you continue thinking this through and drawing it out, if you're

176
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,920
familiar with the graph of trig functions you might guess that this

177
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,360
derivative graph should be exactly cosine of theta, since all the peaks and

178
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,500
valleys line up perfectly with where the peaks and valleys for the cosine

179
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,320
function should be. And spoiler alert, the derivative is in fact the cosine of

180
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,860
theta, but aren't you a little curious about why it's precisely cosine of theta?

181
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,220
I mean you could have all sorts of functions with peaks and valleys at the

182
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,020
same points that have roughly the same shape, but who knows, maybe the derivative

183
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,700
of sine could have turned out to be some entirely new type of function that just

184
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,400
happens to have a similar shape.

185
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,680
Well just like the previous examples, a more exact understanding of the

186
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
derivative requires looking at what the function actually represents, rather than

187
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,140
looking at the graph of the function. So think back to that walk around the unit

188
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,500
circle, having traversed an arc with length theta and thinking about sine of

189
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,240
theta as the height of that point.

190
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,500
Now zoom into that point on the circle and consider a slight nudge of d theta

191
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,860
along their circumference, a tiny step in your walk around the unit circle. How

192
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,940
much does that tiny step change the sine of theta? How much does this increase d

193
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,420
theta of arc length increase the height above the x-axis?

194
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,140
Well zoomed in close enough, the circle basically looks like a straight line in

195
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,140
this neighborhood, so let's go ahead and think of this right triangle where the

196
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,320
hypotenuse of that right triangle represents the nudge d theta along the

197
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,780
circumference, and that left side here represents the change in height, the

198
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,740
resulting d sine of theta. Now this tiny triangle is actually similar to this

199
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,540
larger triangle here, with the defining angle theta and whose hypotenuse is the

200
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,340
radius of the circle with length 1.

201
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,940
Specifically this little angle right here is precisely equal to theta radians.

202
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,000
Now think about what the derivative of sine is supposed to mean. It's the ratio

203
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,940
between that d sine of theta, the tiny change to the height, divided by d theta,

204
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,880
the tiny change to the input of the function. And from the picture we can see

205
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,780
that that's the ratio between the length of the side adjacent to the angle

206
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,960
theta divided by the hypotenuse.

207
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,940
Well let's see, adjacent divided by hypotenuse, that's exactly what the

208
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,220
cosine of theta means, that's the definition of the cosine.

209
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,660
So this gives us two different really nice ways of thinking about how the

210
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,100
derivative of sine is cosine. One of them is looking at the graph and getting a

211
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,840
loose feel for the shape of things based on thinking about the slope of the sine

212
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,240
graph at every single point. And the other is a more precise line of reasoning

213
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,400
looking at the unit circle itself.

214
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,600
For those of you that like to pause and ponder, see if you can try a similar line

215
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,880
of reasoning to find what the derivative of the cosine of theta should be. In the

216
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,040
next video I'll talk about how you can take derivatives of functions who

217
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,440
combine simple functions like these ones, either as sums or products or function

218
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,300
compositions, things like that. And similar to this video the goal is going

219
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,520
to be to understand each one geometrically in a way that makes it

220
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,760
intuitively reasonable and somewhat more memorable.
