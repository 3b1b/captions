1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,415
Now that we've seen what a derivative means and what it has to do with rates of change, 

2
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:19,380
our next step is to learn how to actually compute these guys.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,939
As in, if I give you some kind of function with an explicit formula, 

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,040
you'd want to be able to find what the formula for its derivative is.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,341
Maybe it's obvious, but I think it's worth stating explicitly why this 

6
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:34,085
is an important thing to be able to do, why much of a calculus student's 

7
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:37,470
time ends up going towards grappling with derivatives of abstract 

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,060
functions rather than thinking about concrete rate of change problems.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,909
It's because a lot of real-world phenomena, the sort of things that 

10
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:49,544
we want to use calculus to analyze, are modeled using polynomials, 

11
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:53,560
trigonometric functions, exponentials, and other pure functions like that.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,285
So if you build up some fluency with the ideas of rates of change for those kinds of 

13
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:02,642
pure abstract functions, it gives you a language to more readily talk about the rates 

14
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:07,100
at which things change in concrete situations that you might be using calculus to model.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,141
But it is way too easy for this process to feel like just memorizing a list of rules, 

16
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:16,166
and if that happens, if you get that feeling, it's also easy to lose sight of the 

17
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:20,240
fact that derivatives are fundamentally about just looking at tiny changes to some 

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,020
quantity and how that relates to a resulting tiny change in another quantity.

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,732
So in this video and in the next one, my aim is to show you how you can think 

20
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:31,672
about a few of these rules intuitively and geometrically, 

21
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:35,675
and I really want to encourage you to never forget that tiny nudges are at the 

22
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:36,740
heart of derivatives.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
Let's start with a simple function like f of x equals x squared.

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,740
What if I asked you its derivative?

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,038
That is, if you were to look at some value x, like x equals 2, 

26
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:50,333
and compare it to a value slightly bigger, just dx bigger, 

27
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,740
what's the corresponding change in the value of the function?

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,700
dF.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,693
And in particular, what's dF divided by dx, the rate 

30
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:01,940
at which this function is changing per unit change in x.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,249
As a first step for intuition, we know that you can think of this ratio 

32
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:10,883
dF dx as the slope of a tangent line to the graph of x squared, 

33
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:15,200
and from that you can see that the slope generally increases as x increases.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
At zero, the tangent line is flat, and the slope is zero.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,260
At x equals 1, it's something a bit steeper.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
At x equals 2, it's steeper still.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,579
But looking at graphs isn't generally the best way 

38
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,040
to understand the precise formula for a derivative.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,934
For that, it's best to take a more literal look at what x squared actually means, 

40
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:38,840
and in this case let's go ahead and picture a square whose side length is x.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
If you increase x by some tiny nudge, some little dx, 

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,380
what's the resulting change in the area of that square?

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,480
That slight change in area is what dF means in this context.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,777
It's the tiny increase to the value of f of x equals x squared, 

45
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,420
caused by increasing x by that tiny nudge dx.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,031
Now you can see that there's three new bits of area in this diagram, 

47
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:05,320
two thin rectangles and a minuscule square.

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,106
The two thin rectangles each have side lengths of x and dx, 

49
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,780
so they account for 2 times x times dx units of new area.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,730
For that new area from these two thin rectangles would be 2 times 3 times 0.01, 

51
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,300
which is 0.06, about 6 times the size of dx.

52
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,872
That little square there has an area of dx squared, 

53
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:36,960
but you should think of that as being really tiny, negligibly tiny.

54
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,340
For example, if dx was 0.01, that would be only 0.0001, 

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,086
and keep in mind I'm drawing dx with a fair bit of width here just so we 

56
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:49,662
can actually see it, but always remember in principle, 

57
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:54,993
dx should be thought of as a truly tiny amount, and for those truly tiny amounts, 

58
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:59,674
a good rule of thumb is that you can ignore anything that includes a dx 

59
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,820
raised to a power greater than 1.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,880
That is, a tiny change squared is a negligible change.

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,055
What this leaves us with is that dF is just some multiple of dx, and that multiple 2x, 

62
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:18,100
which you could also write as dF divided by dx, is the derivative of x squared.

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,297
For example, if you were starting at x equals 3, then as you slightly increase x, 

64
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:29,683
the rate of change in the area per unit change in length added, dx squared over dx, 

65
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:34,427
would be 2 times 3, or 6, and if instead you were starting at x equals 5, 

66
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:38,980
then the rate of change would be 10 units of area per unit change in x.

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,420
Let's go ahead and try a different simple function, f of x equals x cubed.

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,039
This is going to be the geometric view of the stuff 

69
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,140
that I went through algebraically in the last video.

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,641
What's nice here is that we can think of x cubed as the volume of an actual 

71
00:04:55,641 --> 00:05:00,020
cube whose side lengths are x, and when you increase x by a tiny nudge, 

72
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,520
a tiny dx, the resulting increase in volume is what I have here in yellow.

73
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,748
That represents all the volume in a cube with side lengths x plus dx 

74
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:12,580
that's not already in the original cube, the one with side length x.

75
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,602
It's nice to think of this new volume as broken up into multiple components, 

76
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:22,386
but almost all of it comes from these three square faces, 

77
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:25,843
or said a little more precisely, as dx approaches 0, 

78
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:30,279
those three squares comprise a portion closer and closer to 100% of 

79
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,780
that new yellow volume.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,058
Each of those thin squares has a volume of x squared times dx, 

81
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:41,540
the area of the face times that little thickness dx.

82
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,260
So in total this gives us 3x squared dx of volume change.

83
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,062
And to be sure there are other slivers of volume here along the edges 

84
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:54,877
and that tiny one in the corner, but all of that volume is going to be 

85
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:58,640
proportional to dx squared, or dx cubed, so we can safely ignore them.

86
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,466
Again this is ultimately because they're going to be divided by dx, 

87
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:07,118
and if there's still any dx remaining then those terms aren't 

88
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:10,300
going to survive the process of letting dx approach 0.

89
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,435
What this means is that the derivative of x cubed, 

90
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:19,200
the rate at which x cubed changes per unit change of x, is 3 times x squared.

91
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,185
What that means in terms of graphical intuition is that the slope of 

92
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:29,600
the graph of x cubed at every single point x is exactly 3x squared.

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,786
And reasoning about that slope, it should make sense that this derivative is high on the 

94
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:42,805
left and then 0 at the origin and then high again as you move to the right, 

95
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:47,142
but just thinking in terms of the graph would never have landed us on the precise 

96
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,200
quantity 3x squared.

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,060
For that we had to take a much more direct look at what x cubed actually means.

98
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,561
Now in practice you wouldn't necessarily think of the square every 

99
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,927
time you're taking the derivative of x squared, 

100
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,278
nor would you necessarily think of this cube whenever you're taking 

101
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:04,560
the derivative of x cubed.

102
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
Both of them fall under a pretty recognizable pattern for polynomial terms.

103
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,341
The derivative of x to the fourth turns out to be 4x cubed, 

104
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:17,760
the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to the fourth, and so on.

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,792
Abstractly you'd write this as the derivative of x to 

106
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:26,560
the n for any power n is n times x to the n minus 1.

107
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,560
This right here is what's known in the business as the power rule.

108
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,913
In practice we all quickly just get jaded and think about this symbolically as 

109
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,769
the exponent hopping down in front, leaving behind one less than itself, 

110
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:44,260
rarely pausing to think about the geometric delights that underlie these derivatives.

111
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,296
That's the kind of thing that happens when these tend 

112
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,200
to fall in the middle of much longer computations.

113
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,328
But rather than tracking it all off to symbolic patterns, 

114
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:57,360
let's just take a moment and think about why this works for powers beyond just 2 and 3.

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,773
When you nudge that input x, increasing it slightly to x plus dx, 

116
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,974
working out the exact value of that nudged output would involve 

117
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:10,520
multiplying together these n separate x plus dx terms.

118
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,890
The full expansion would be really complicated, 

119
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,460
but part of the point of derivatives is that most of that complication can be ignored.

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,020
The first term in your expansion is x to the n.

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,584
This is analogous to the area of the original square, 

122
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:28,920
or the volume of the original cube from our previous examples.

123
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,039
For the next terms in the expansion you can choose mostly x's with a single dx.

124
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,804
Since there are n different parentheticals from which you could have chosen 

125
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:50,016
that single dx, this gives us n separate terms, 

126
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,160
all of which include n minus 1 x's times a dx, 

127
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,640
giving a value of x to the power n minus 1 times dx.

128
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,820
This is analogous to how the majority of the new area in the square came from those 

129
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,997
two bars, each with area x times dx, or how the bulk of the new volume in the cube 

130
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:13,300
came from those three thin squares, each of which had a volume of x squared times dx.

131
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,432
There will be many other terms of this expansion, 

132
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,251
but all of them are just going to be some multiple of dx squared, 

133
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:25,185
so we can safely ignore them, and what that means is that all but a 

134
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:29,350
negligible portion of the increase in the output comes from n copies of 

135
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,260
this x to the n minus 1 times dx.

136
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,520
That's what it means for the derivative of x to the n to be n times x to the n minus 1.

137
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,220
And even though, like I said in practice, you'll find yourself performing this 

138
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,911
derivative quickly and symbolically, imagining the exponent hopping down to the front, 

139
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:52,280
every now and then it's nice to just step back and remember why these rules work.

140
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,880
Not just because it's pretty, and not just because it helps remind us that math 

141
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,332
actually makes sense and isn't just a pile of formulas to memorize, 

142
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:04,494
but because it flexes that very important muscle of thinking about derivatives in 

143
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:05,560
terms of tiny nudges.

144
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,640
As another example, think of the function f of x equals 1 divided by x.

145
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,738
Now on the hand you could just blindly try applying the power rule, 

146
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:20,540
since 1 divided by x is the same as writing x to the negative 1.

147
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,433
That would involve letting the negative 1 hop down in front, 

148
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,440
leaving behind 1 less than itself, which is negative 2.

149
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,444
But let's have some fun and see if we can reason about this geometrically, 

150
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:33,580
rather than just plugging it through some formula.

151
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,180
The value 1 over x is asking what number multiplied by x equals 1.

152
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,820
So here's how I'd like to visualize it.

153
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,120
Imagine a little rectangular puddle of water sitting in two dimensions whose area is 1.

154
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,766
And let's say that its width is x, which means that the height has to be 1 over x, 

155
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:55,620
since the total area of it is 1.

156
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,040
So if x was stretched out to 2, then that height is forced down to 1 half.

157
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,920
And if you increased x up to 3, then the other side has to be squished down to 1 third.

158
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,680
This is a nice way to think about the graph of 1 over x, by the way.

159
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,360
If you think of this width x of the puddle as being in the xy-plane, 

160
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,623
then that corresponding output 1 divided by x, the height of the graph above that point, 

161
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:24,940
is whatever the height of your puddle has to be to maintain an area of 1.

162
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,358
So with this visual in mind, for the derivative, 

163
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:33,580
imagine nudging up that value of x by some tiny amount, some tiny dx.

164
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,401
How must the height of this rectangle change so 

165
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:40,340
that the area of the puddle remains constant at 1?

166
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,020
That is, increasing the width by dx adds some new area to the right here.

167
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,355
So the puddle has to decrease in height by some d 1 over x, 

168
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:54,860
so that the area lost off of that top cancels out the area gained.

169
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,259
You should think of that d 1 over x as being a negative amount, 

170
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,320
by the way, since it's decreasing the height of the rectangle.

171
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,400
And you know what?

172
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,027
I'm going to leave the last few steps here for you, 

173
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,720
for you to pause and ponder and work out an ultimate expression.

174
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,121
And once you reason out what d of 1 over x divided by dx should be, 

175
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:17,839
I want you to compare it to what you would have gotten if you had just 

176
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,820
blindly applied the power rule, purely symbolically, to x to the negative 1.

177
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,143
And while I'm encouraging you to pause and ponder, 

178
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,520
here's another fun challenge if you're feeling up to it.

179
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,420
See if you can reason through what the derivative of the square root of x should be.

180
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,053
To finish things off, I want to tackle one more type of function, 

181
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:44,260
trigonometric functions, and in particular let's focus on the sine function.

182
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,230
So for this section I'm going to assume that you're already 

183
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,674
familiar with how to think about trig functions using the unit circle, 

184
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,100
the circle with a radius 1 centered at the origin.

185
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,152
For a given value of theta, like say 0.8, you imagine yourself 

186
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:02,878
walking around the circle starting from the rightmost point 

187
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:06,480
until you've traversed that distance of 0.8 in arc length.

188
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,718
This is the same thing as saying that the angle right here is exactly theta radians, 

189
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,760
since the circle has a radius of 1.

190
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,013
Then what sine of theta means is the height of that point above the x-axis, 

191
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:24,507
and as your theta value increases and you walk around the circle 

192
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:28,240
your height bobs up and down between negative 1 and 1.

193
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,616
So when you graph sine of theta versus theta you get this wave pattern, 

194
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:35,660
the quintessential wave pattern.

195
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,311
And just from looking at this graph we can start to 

196
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:43,180
get a feel for the shape of the derivative of the sine.

197
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,828
The slope at 0 is something positive since sine of theta is increasing there, 

198
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:54,191
and as we move to the right and sine of theta approaches its peak that slope goes down 

199
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:54,500
to 0.

200
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,340
Then the slope is negative for a little while, 

201
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,080
while the sine is decreasing before coming back up to 0 as the sine graph levels out.

202
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,433
And as you continue thinking this through and drawing it out, 

203
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:11,174
if you're familiar with the graph of trig functions you might guess that this 

204
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,668
derivative graph should be exactly cosine of theta, 

205
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:17,265
since all the peaks and valleys line up perfectly with where the peaks and 

206
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,280
valleys for the cosine function should be.

207
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,910
And spoiler alert, the derivative is in fact the cosine of theta, 

208
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,860
but aren't you a little curious about why it's precisely cosine of theta?

209
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,158
I mean you could have all sorts of functions with peaks and valleys at the same points 

210
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,365
that have roughly the same shape, but who knows, 

211
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:38,103
maybe the derivative of sine could have turned out to be some entirely new type of 

212
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:40,400
function that just happens to have a similar shape.

213
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,832
Well just like the previous examples, a more exact understanding 

214
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:48,662
of the derivative requires looking at what the function actually represents, 

215
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:51,100
rather than looking at the graph of the function.

216
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,996
So think back to that walk around the unit circle, 

217
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:58,967
having traversed an arc with length theta and thinking about sine of theta as 

218
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,240
the height of that point.

219
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,247
Now zoom into that point on the circle and consider a slight nudge of d theta 

220
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:10,620
along their circumference, a tiny step in your walk around the unit circle.

221
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,640
How much does that tiny step change the sine of theta?

222
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,420
How much does this increase d theta of arc length increase the height above the x-axis?

223
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,181
Well zoomed in close enough, the circle basically looks like a straight line in this 

224
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:30,777
neighborhood, so let's go ahead and think of this right triangle where the hypotenuse 

225
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:34,891
of that right triangle represents the nudge d theta along the circumference, 

226
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:39,540
and that left side here represents the change in height, the resulting d sine of theta.

227
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,185
Now this tiny triangle is actually similar to this larger triangle here, 

228
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:48,841
with the defining angle theta and whose hypotenuse is the radius of the circle with 

229
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:49,340
length 1.

230
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,940
Specifically this little angle right here is precisely equal to theta radians.

231
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,520
Now think about what the derivative of sine is supposed to mean.

232
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,585
It's the ratio between that d sine of theta, the tiny change to the height, 

233
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:09,320
divided by d theta, the tiny change to the input of the function.

234
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,052
And from the picture we can see that that's the ratio between the 

235
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:17,960
length of the side adjacent to the angle theta divided by the hypotenuse.

236
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,518
Well let's see, adjacent divided by hypotenuse, 

237
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:26,220
that's exactly what the cosine of theta means, that's the definition of the cosine.

238
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,223
So this gives us two different really nice ways of 

239
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,960
thinking about how the derivative of sine is cosine.

240
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,642
One of them is looking at the graph and getting a loose feel for the shape of 

241
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:40,280
things based on thinking about the slope of the sine graph at every single point.

242
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,400
And the other is a more precise line of reasoning looking at the unit circle itself.

243
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,276
For those of you that like to pause and ponder, 

244
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,846
see if you can try a similar line of reasoning to find what the derivative of 

245
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,220
the cosine of theta should be.

246
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,496
In the next video I'll talk about how you can take derivatives 

247
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,470
of functions who combine simple functions like these ones, 

248
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,000
either as sums or products or function compositions, things like that.

249
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,643
And similar to this video the goal is going to be to understand each one 

250
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:13,359
geometrically in a way that makes it intuitively reasonable and somewhat more memorable.
