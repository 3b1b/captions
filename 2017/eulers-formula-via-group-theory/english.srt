00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Two years ago, almost to the day actually, I put up the first video on this channel,

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,440
about Euler's formula, e to the pi i equals negative one.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,280
As an anniversary of sorts, I want to revisit that same idea.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,480
For one thing, I've always wanted to improve on the presentation, but I wouldn't rehash

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,860
an old topic if there wasn't something new to teach.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,520
You see, the idea underlying that video was to take certain concepts from a field in math

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,380
called group theory, and show how they give Euler's formula a richer interpretation

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,960
than a mere association between numbers.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,960
And two years ago, I thought it might be fun to use those ideas without referencing group

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,960
theory itself, or any of the technical terms within it.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,120
But I've come to see that you all actually quite like getting into the math itself, even

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
if it takes some time.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,560
So here, two years later, let's you and me go through an introduction to the basics

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,840
of group theory, building up to how Euler's formula comes to life under this light.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,040
If all you want is a quick explanation of Euler's formula, and if you're comfortable

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,080
with vector calculus, I'll go ahead and put up a particularly short explanation on

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,740
the screen that you can pause and ponder on.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,280
If it doesn't make sense, don't worry about it, it's not needed for where we're

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
going.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,860
The reason I want to put out this group theory review, though, is not because I think it's

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,240
a better explanation.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Heck, it's not even a complete proof, it's just an intuition really.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,720
It's because it has the chance to change how you think about numbers, and how you think

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
about algebra.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,820
You see, group theory is all about studying the nature of symmetry.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,820
For example, a square is a very symmetric shape, but what do we actually mean by that?

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,000
One way to answer that is to ask about what are all the actions you can take on the square

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,800
that leave it looking indistinguishable from how it started.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,360
For example, you could rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise, and it looks totally the

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
same to how it started.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,680
You could also flip it around this vertical line, and again, it still looks identical.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,400
In fact, the thing about such perfect symmetry is that it's hard to keep track of what

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,020
action has actually been taken, so to help out I'm going to stick on an asymmetric

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,800
image here.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,380
We call each one of these actions a symmetry of the square, and all of the symmetries together

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:27,720
make up a group of symmetries, or just group for short.

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,380
This particular group consists of 8 symmetries.

38
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,780
There's the action of doing nothing, which is one we count, plus 3 different rotations,

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,340
and then there's 4 ways you can flip it over.

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,640
In fact, this group of 8 symmetries has a special name, it's called the dihedral group

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,780
of order 8.

42
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,180
That's an example of a finite group, consisting of only 8 actions, but a lot of other groups

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,200
consist of infinitely many actions.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,180
Think of all possible rotations, for example, of any angle.

45
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,740
Maybe you think of this as a group that acts on a circle, capturing all of the symmetries

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,940
of that circle that don't involve flipping it.

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,780
Here, every action from this group of rotation lies somewhere on the infinite continuum between

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,780
0 and 2 pi radians.

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,300
One nice aspect of these actions is that we can associate each one of them with a single

50
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,700
point on the circle itself, the thing being acted on.

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,320
You start by choosing some arbitrary point, maybe the one on the right here.

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Then every circle symmetry, every possible rotation, takes this marked point to some

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,820
unique spot on the circle, and the action itself is completely determined by where it

54
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,780
takes that spot.

55
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,260
This doesn't always happen with groups, but it's nice when it does happen, because

56
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,180
it gives us a way to label the actions themselves, which can otherwise be pretty tricky to think

57
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,440
about.

58
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,140
The study of groups is not just about what a particular set of symmetries is, whether

59
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,460
that's the 8 symmetries of a square, the infinite continuum of symmetries of the circle,

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,380
or anything else you dream up.

61
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,080
The real heart and soul of the study is knowing how these symmetries play with each other.

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:22,080
On the square, if I rotate 90 degrees and then flip around the vertical axis, the overall

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,740
effect is the same as if I had just flipped over this diagonal line.

64
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:36,240
So in some sense, that rotation plus the vertical flip equals that diagonal flip.

65
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,440
On the circle, if I rotate 270 degrees and then follow it with a rotation of 120 degrees,

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,520
the overall effect is the same as if I had just rotated 30 degrees to start with.

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,160
So in this circle group, a 270 degree rotation plus a 120 degree rotation equals a 30 degree

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,520
rotation.

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,000
And in general, with any group, any collection of these sorts of symmetric actions, there's

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,880
a kind of arithmetic, where you can always take two actions and add them together to

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,640
get a third one, by applying one after the other.

72
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,240
Or maybe you think of it as multiplying actions, it doesn't really matter.

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,880
The point is that there is some way to combine the two actions to get out another one.

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,640
That collection of underlying relations, all associations between pairs of actions and

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,120
the single action that's equivalent to applying one after the other, that's really what

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,760
makes a group a group.

77
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,000
It's actually crazy how much of modern math is rooted in, well, this, in understanding

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,960
how a collection of actions is organized by this relation, this relation between pairs

79
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,360
of actions and the single action you get by composing them.

80
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,040
Groups are extremely general.

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,240
A lot of different ideas can be framed in terms of symmetries and composing symmetries.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,580
And maybe the most familiar example is numbers, just ordinary numbers.

83
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,540
There are two separate ways to think about numbers as a group.

84
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,020
One where composing actions will look like addition, and another where composing actions

85
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,260
will look like multiplication.

86
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,700
It's a little weird, because we don't usually think of numbers as actions, we usually

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,740
think of them as counting things.

88
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,820
But let me show you what I mean.

89
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,180
Think of all the ways you can slide a number line left or right along itself.

90
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,040
This collection of all sliding actions is a group, what you might think of as the group

91
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,120
of symmetries on an infinite line.

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,400
And in the same way that actions from the circle group could be associated with individual

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,240
points on that circle, this is another one of those special groups where we can associate

94
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,200
each action with a unique point on the thing that it's actually acting on.

95
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,760
You just follow where the point that starts at 0 ends up.

96
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,800
For example, the number 3 is associated with the action of sliding right by 3 units.

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,880
The number negative 2 is associated with the action of sliding 2 units to the left,

98
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,000
since that's the unique action that drags the point at 0 over to the point at negative

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,320
2.

100
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,560
The number 0 itself is associated with the action of doing nothing.

101
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,920
This group of sliding actions, each one of which is associated with a unique real number,

102
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,280
has a special name, the additive group of real numbers.

103
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,480
The reason the word additive is in there is because of what the group operation of applying

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,540
one action followed by another looks like.

105
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,200
If I slide right by 3 units, and then slide right by 2 units, the overall effect is the

106
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,760
same as if I slid right by 3 plus 2, or 5 units.

107
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,200
Simple enough, we're just adding the distances of each slide.

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,760
But the point here is that this gives an alternate view for what numbers even are.

109
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,280
They are one example in a much larger category of groups, groups of symmetries acting on

110
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,960
some object, and the arithmetic of adding numbers is just one example of the arithmetic

111
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,360
that any group of symmetries has within it.

112
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,880
We could also extend this idea, instead asking about the sliding actions on the complex plane.

113
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,400
The newly introduced numbers i, 2i, 3i, and so on on this vertical line would all be associated

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,880
with vertical sliding motions, since those are the actions that drag the point at 0 up

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,560
to the relevant point on that vertical line.

116
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,600
The point over here at 3 plus 2i would be associated with the action of sliding the

117
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,060
plane in such a way that drags 0 up and to the right to that point.

118
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,100
And it should make sense why we call this 3 plus 2i.

119
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,380
That diagonal sliding action is the same as first sliding by 3 to the right, and then

120
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:03,580
following it with a slide that corresponds to 2i, which is 2 units vertically.

121
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,060
Similarly, let's get a feel for how composing any two of these actions generally breaks

122
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,420
down.

123
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:17,700
Consider this slide by 3 plus 2i action, as well as this slide by 1 minus 3i action, and

124
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,060
imagine applying one of them right after the other.

125
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,800
The overall effect, the composition of these two sliding actions, is the same as if we

126
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,380
had slid 3 plus 1 to the right, and 2 minus 3 vertically.

127
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,820
Notice how that involves adding together each component.

128
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,200
So composing sliding actions is another way to think about what adding complex numbers

129
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,420
actually means.

130
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,740
This collection of all sliding actions on the 2d complex plane goes by the name the

131
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,060
additive group of complex numbers.

132
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,740
Again, the upshot here is that numbers, even complex numbers, are just one example of a

133
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,660
group, and the idea of addition can be thought of in terms of successively applying actions.

134
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,900
But numbers, schizophrenic as they are, also lead a completely different life as a completely

135
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,460
different kind of group.

136
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,420
Consider a new group of actions on the number line, all ways that you can stretch or squish

137
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,300
it, keeping everything evenly spaced, and keeping that number 0 fixed in place.

138
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,060
Yet again, this group of actions has that nice property, where we can associate each

139
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,360
action in the group with a specific point on the thing it's acting on.

140
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,860
In this case, follow where the point that starts at the number 1 goes.

141
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,260
There is one and only one stretching action that brings that point at 1 to the point at

142
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,860
3, for instance, namely stretching by a factor of 3.

143
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Likewise, there is one and only one action that brings that point at 1 to the point at

144
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,540
1 half, namely squishing by a factor of 1 half.

145
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,220
I like to imagine using one hand to fix the number 0 in place, and using the other to

146
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,300
drag the number 1 wherever I like, while the rest of the number line does whatever it takes

147
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,660
to stay evenly spaced.

148
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,860
In this way, every single positive number is associated with a unique stretching or

149
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,980
squishing action.

150
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,900
Now notice what composing actions looks like in this group.

151
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,820
If I apply the stretch by 3 action, and then follow it with the stretch by 2 action, the

152
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,280
overall effect is the same as if I had just applied the stretch by 6 action, the product

153
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,100
of the two original numbers.

154
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,660
In general, applying one of these actions followed by another corresponds with multiplying

155
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,460
the numbers they're associated with.

156
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,440
In fact, the name for this group is the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.

157
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,620
So multiplication, ordinary familiar multiplication, is one more example of this very general and

158
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,920
very far-reaching idea of groups, and the arithmetic within groups.

159
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,000
We can also extend this idea to the complex plane.

160
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,080
Again, I like to think of fixing 0 in place with one hand, and dragging around the point

161
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,180
at 1, keeping everything else evenly spaced while I do so.

162
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,480
But this time, as we drag the number 1 to places that are off the real number line,

163
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,120
we see that our group includes not only stretching and squishing actions, but actions that have

164
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,220
some rotational component as well.

165
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,300
The quintessential example of this is the action associated with that point at i, one

166
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,600
unit above 0.

167
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,100
What it takes to drag the point at 1 to that point at i is a 90 degree rotation.

168
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,660
So the multiplicative action associated with i is a 90 degree rotation.

169
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,240
And notice, if I apply that action twice in a row, the overall effect is to flip the plane

170
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,560
180 degrees, and that is the unique action that brings the point at 1 over to negative

171
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,860
1.

172
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,360
So in this sense, i times i equals negative 1, meaning the action associated with i, followed

173
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,280
by that same action associated with i, has the same overall effect as the action associated

174
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,040
with negative 1.

175
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,760
As another example, here's the action associated with 2 plus i, dragging 1 up to that point.

176
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,080
If you want, you could think of this as broken down as a rotation by 30 degrees, followed

177
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,160
by a stretch by a factor of square root of 5.

178
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,440
And in general, every one of these multiplicative actions is some combination of a stretch or

179
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,600
a squish, an action associated with some point on the positive real number line, followed

180
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,100
by a pure rotation, where pure rotations are associated with points on this circle,

181
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,560
the one with radius 1.

182
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,940
This is very similar to how the sliding actions in the additive group could be broken down

183
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,380
as some pure horizontal slide, represented with points on the real number line, plus

184
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,760
some purely vertical slide, represented with points on that vertical line.

185
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,180
That comparison of how actions in each group breaks down is going to be important, so remember

186
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,180
In each one, you can break down any action as some purely real number action, followed

187
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,180
by something specific to complex numbers, whether that's vertical slides for the additive

188
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:36,980
group, or pure rotations for the multiplicative group.

189
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,180
So that's our quick introduction to groups.

190
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,420
A group is a collection of symmetric actions on some mathematical object, whether that's

191
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,420
a square, a circle, the real number line, or anything else you dream up.

192
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,300
And every group has a certain arithmetic, where you can combine two actions by applying

193
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,620
one after the other, and asking what other action from the group gives the same overall

194
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,820
effect.

195
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,420
Numbers, both real and complex numbers, can be thought of in two different ways as a group.

196
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,220
They can act by sliding, in which case the group arithmetic just looks like ordinary

197
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,780
addition, or they can act by stretching-squishing-rotating actions, in which case the group arithmetic

198
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,220
looks just like multiplication.

199
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,780
And with that, let's talk about exponentiation.

200
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:32,820
Our first introduction to exponents is to think of them in terms of repeated multiplication.

201
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,020
The meaning of something like 2 cubed is to take 2x2x2, and the meaning of something like

202
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,180
2 to the 5th is 2x2x2x2x2.

203
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,820
And a consequence of this, something you might call the exponential property, is that if

204
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I add two numbers in the exponent, say 2 to the 3 plus 5, this can be broken down as the

205
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,460
product of 2 to the 3rd times 2 to the 5.

206
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,340
And when you expand things, this seems reasonable enough, right?

207
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:10,300
But expressions like 2 to the ½, or 2 to the –1, and much less 2 to the i don't

208
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,100
really make sense when you think of exponents as repeated multiplication.

209
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,000
What does it mean to multiply 2 by itself half of a time, or –1 of a time?

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,180
So we do something very common throughout math, and extend beyond the original definition,

211
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,940
which only makes sense for counting numbers, to something that applies to all sorts of

212
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
numbers.

213
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,940
But we don't just do this randomly.

214
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,220
If you think back to how fractional and negative exponents are defined, it's always motivated

215
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,900
by trying to make sure that this property, 2 to the x plus y equals 2 to the x times

216
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,040
2 to the y, still holds.

217
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,940
To see what this might mean for complex exponents, think about what this property is saying from

218
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,620
a group theory light.

219
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,900
It's saying that adding the inputs corresponds with multiplying the outputs, and that makes

220
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,340
it very tempting to think of the inputs not merely as numbers, but as members of the additive

221
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:09,540
group of sliding actions, and to think of the outputs not merely as numbers, but as

222
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,460
members of this multiplicative group of stretching and squishing actions.

223
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,600
It is weird and strange to think about functions that take in one kind of action and spit out

224
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,460
another kind of action, but this is something that actually comes up all the time throughout

225
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,660
group theory.

226
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,260
And this exponential property is very important for this association between groups.

227
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,200
It guarantees that if I compose two sliding actions, maybe a slide by negative 1 and then

228
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,200
a slide by positive 2, it corresponds to composing the two output actions, in this case squishing

229
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:53,860
by 2 to the negative 1 and then stretching by 2 squared.

230
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,060
Mathematicians would describe a property like this by saying that the function preserves

231
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,060
the group structure, in the sense that the arithmetic within a group is what gives it

232
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:11,380
its structure, and a function like this exponential plays nicely with that arithmetic.

233
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,740
Functions between groups that preserve the arithmetic like this are really important

234
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,380
throughout group theory, enough so that they've earned themselves a nice fancy name, homomorphisms.

235
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,740
Think about what all this means for associating the additive group in the complex plane with

236
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,320
the multiplicative group in the complex plane.

237
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,380
We already know that when you plug in a real number to 2 to the x, you get out a real number,

238
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,720
a positive real number in fact.

239
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,980
So this exponential function takes any purely horizontal slide and turns it into some pure

240
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,900
stretching or squishing action.

241
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,220
So wouldn't you agree that it would be reasonable for this new dimension of additive actions

242
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:02,020
slides up and down to map directly into this new dimension of multiplicative actions, pure

243
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,820
rotations.

244
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,200
Those vertical sliding actions correspond to points on this vertical axis, and those

245
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,180
rotating multiplicative actions correspond to points on the circle with radius 1.

246
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,320
So what it would mean for an exponential function like 2 to the x to map purely vertical

247
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,780
slides into pure rotations would be that complex numbers on this vertical line, multiples of

248
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,980
i, get mapped to complex numbers on this unit circle.

249
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,460
In fact, for the function 2 to the x, the input i, a vertical slide of one unit, happens

250
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:46,140
to map to a rotation of about 0.693 radians, that is, a walk around the unit circle that

251
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,740
covers 0.693 units of distance.

252
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,400
With a different exponential function, say 5 to the x, that input i, a vertical slide

253
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,420
of one unit, would map to a rotation of about 1.609 radians, a walk around the unit circle

254
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,980
covering exactly 1.609 units of distance.

255
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:15,000
What makes the number e special is that when the exponential e to the x maps vertical slides

256
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,600
to rotations, a vertical slide of one unit, corresponding to i, maps to a rotation of

257
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,900
exactly one radian, a walk around the unit circle covering a distance of exactly one.

258
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:35,020
A vertical slide of two units would map to a rotation of two radians.

259
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,100
A three unit slide up corresponds to a rotation of three radians.

260
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:48,140
A vertical slide of exactly pi units up, corresponding to the input pi times i, maps to a rotation

261
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,180
of exactly pi radians, halfway around the circle, and that's the multiplicative action

262
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,740
associated with the number negative one.

263
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,300
Now you might ask, why e?

264
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,540
Why not some other base?

265
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,300
The full answer resides in calculus, that's the birthplace of e, and where it's even

266
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
defined.

267
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,180
Again, I'll leave up another explanation on the screen if you're hungry for a fuller

268
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,580
description and if you're comfortable with the calculus, but at a high level I'll say

269
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,500
that it has to do with the fact that all exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative,

270
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,820
but e to the x alone is the one that's actually equal to its own derivative.

271
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,780
The important point that I want to make here though, is that if you view things from the

272
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:36,260
lens of group theory, thinking of the inputs to an exponential function as sliding actions,

273
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,320
and thinking of the outputs as stretching and rotating actions, it gives a very vivid

274
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,180
way to read what a formula like this is even saying.

275
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,380
When you read it, you can think that exponentials in general map purely vertical slides, the

276
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,820
additive actions that are perpendicular to the real number line, into pure rotations,

277
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,420
which are in some sense perpendicular to the real number stretching actions.

278
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,640
And moreover, e to the x does this in the very special way that ensures that a vertical

279
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:13,460
slide of pi units corresponds to a rotation of exactly pi radians, the 180 degree rotation

280
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,860
associated with the number negative one.

281
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,820
To finish things off here, I want to show a way that you can think about this function

282
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,380
e to the x as a transformation of the complex plane.

283
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,700
But before that, just two quick messages.

284
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,020
I've mentioned before just how thankful I am to you, the community, for making these

285
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,260
videos possible through Patreon, but in much the same way that numbers become more meaningful

286
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,260
when you think of them as actions, gratitude is also best expressed as an action.

287
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,200
So I've decided to turn off ads on new videos for their first month, in the hopes of giving

288
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,940
you all a better viewing experience.

289
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,640
This video was sponsored by Emerald Cloud Lab, and actually I was the one to reach out

290
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,340
to them on this one, since it's a company I find particularly inspiring.

291
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,120
Emerald is a very unusual startup, half software, half biotech.

292
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,260
The Cloud Lab that they're building essentially enables biologists and chemists to conduct

293
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,640
research through a software platform instead of working in a lab.

294
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,960
Scientists can program experiments, which are then executed remotely and robotically

295
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,820
in Emerald's industrialized research lab.

296
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,220
I know some of the people at the company, and the software challenges they're working

297
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
on are really interesting.

298
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,060
Currently they're looking to hire software engineers and web developers for their engineering

299
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,820
team, as well as applied mathematicians and computer scientists for their scientific computing

300
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,340
team.

301
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,360
If you're interested in applying, whether that's now or a few months from now, there

302
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,060
are a couple special links in the description of this video, and if you apply through those,

303
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,220
it lets Emerald know you heard about them through this channel.

304
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,120
Alright, so e to the x transforming the plane.

305
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,540
I like to imagine first rolling that plane into a cylinder, wrapping all those vertical

306
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,100
lines into circles, and then taking that cylinder and kinda smooshing it onto the plane around

307
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,220
zero, where each of those concentric circles spaced out exponentially correspond with what

308
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,340
started off as vertical lines.
