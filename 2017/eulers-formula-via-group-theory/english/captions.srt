00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,128
Two years ago, almost to the day actually, I put up the first video on this channel, 

2
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:12,500
about Euler's formula, e to the pi i equals negative one.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,540
As an anniversary of sorts, I want to revisit that same idea.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,219
For one thing, I've always wanted to improve on the presentation, 

5
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,560
but I wouldn't rehash an old topic if there wasn't something new to teach.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,956
You see, the idea underlying that video was to take certain concepts from 

7
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:31,774
a field in math called group theory, and show how they give Euler's formula 

8
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:35,240
a much richer interpretation than a mere association between numbers.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,565
And two years ago, I thought it might be fun to use those ideas without 

10
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:43,200
referencing group theory itself, or any of the technical terms within it.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,751
But I've come to see that you all actually quite like getting into the math itself, 

12
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:49,060
even if it takes some time.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
So here, two years later, lets you and me go through an introduction to the basics 

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,880
of group theory, building up to how Euler's formula comes to life under this light.

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,796
If all you want is a quick explanation of Euler's formula, 

16
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,348
and if you're comfortable with vector calculus, 

17
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:08,751
I'll put up a particularly short explanation on the screen that 

18
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:10,240
you can pause and ponder on.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,040
If it doesn't make sense, don't worry about it, it's not needed for where we're going.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,295
The reason I want to put out this group theory view, 

21
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,980
though, is not because I think it's a better explanation.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,000
Heck, it's not even a complete proof, it's just an intuition really.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,788
It's because it has the chance to change how you think about numbers, 

24
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,520
and how you think about algebra.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,860
You see, group theory is all about studying the nature of symmetry.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,640
For example, a square is a very symmetric shape, but what do we actually mean by that?

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,310
One way to answer that is to ask about what are all the actions you can take 

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,780
on the square that leave it looking indistinguishable from how it started.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,796
For example, you could rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise, 

30
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:56,580
and it looks totally the same to how it started.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,560
You could also flip it around this vertical line, and again, it still looks identical.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,756
In fact, the thing about such perfect symmetry is that it's 

33
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:08,820
hard to keep track of what action has actually been taken, 

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,040
so to help out I'm going to stick on an asymmetric image here.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,464
We call each one of these actions a symmetry of the square, 

36
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:22,320
and all of the symmetries together make up a group of symmetries, or just group for short.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
This particular group consists of 8 symmetries.

38
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,484
There's the action of doing nothing, which is one we count, 

39
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:39,040
plus 3 different rotations, and then there's 4 ways you can flip it over.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,068
In fact, this group of 8 symmetries has a special name, 

41
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:45,520
it's called the dihedral group of order 8.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,729
And that's an example of a finite group, consisting of only 8 actions, 

43
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,260
but a lot of other groups consist of infinitely many actions.

44
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,560
Think of all possible rotations, for example, of any angle.

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,273
Maybe you think of this as a group that acts on a circle, 

46
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:06,460
capturing all of the symmetries of that circle that don't involve flipping it.

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,249
Here, every action from this group of rotation lies 

48
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:14,840
somewhere on the infinite continuum between 0 and 2 pi radians.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,439
One nice aspect of these actions is that we can associate each one of 

50
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,800
them with a single point on the circle itself, the thing being acted on.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,620
You start by choosing some arbitrary point, maybe the one on the right here.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,416
Then every circle symmetry, every possible rotation, 

53
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,107
takes this marked point to some unique spot on the circle, 

54
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:43,800
and the action itself is completely determined by where it takes that spot.

55
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,019
Now, this doesn't always happen with groups, but it's nice when it does happen, 

56
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,028
because it gives us a way to label the actions themselves, 

57
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,680
which can otherwise be pretty tricky to think about.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,124
The study of groups is not just about what a particular set of symmetries is, 

59
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:05,720
whether that's the 8 symmetries of a square, the infinite continuum 

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,840
of symmetries of the circle, or anything else you dream up.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,200
The real heart and soul of the study is knowing how these symmetries play with each other.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,311
On the square, if I rotate 90 degrees and then flip around the vertical axis, 

63
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:25,760
the overall effect is the same as if I had just flipped over this diagonal line.

64
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,660
So in some sense, that rotation plus the vertical flip equals that diagonal flip.

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,264
On the circle, if I rotate 270 degrees and then follow it with a rotation of 120 degrees, 

66
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:47,920
the overall effect is the same as if I had just rotated 30 degrees to start with.

67
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,496
So in this circle group, a 270 degree rotation plus 

68
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:57,800
a 120 degree rotation equals a 30 degree rotation.

69
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,222
And in general, with any group, any collection of these sorts of symmetric actions, 

70
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:09,749
there's a kind of arithmetic, where you can always take two actions and add 

71
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,680
them together to get a third one, by applying one after the other.

72
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,980
Or maybe you think of it as multiplying actions, it doesn't really matter.

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
The point is that there is some way to combine the two actions to get out another one.

74
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,580
That collection of underlying relations, all associations between 

75
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,117
pairs of actions and the single action that's equivalent to applying one after the other, 

76
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,640
that's really what makes a group a group.

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,617
It's actually crazy how much of modern math is rooted in, well, this, 

78
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:47,066
in understanding how a collection of actions is organized by this relation, 

79
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:52,160
this relation between pairs of actions and the single action you get by composing them.

80
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,740
Groups are extremely general.

81
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,460
A lot of different ideas can be framed in terms of symmetries and composing symmetries.

82
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,540
And maybe the most familiar example is numbers, just ordinary numbers.

83
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,820
And there are actually two separate ways to think about numbers as a group.

84
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,240
One where composing actions is going to look like addition, 

85
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,320
and another where composing actions will look like multiplication.

86
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,974
It's a little weird, because we don't usually think of numbers as actions, 

87
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,200
we usually think of them as counting things.

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,920
But let me show you what I mean.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,160
Think of all of the ways that you can slide a number line left or right along itself.

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,911
This collection of all sliding actions is a group, 

91
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:37,020
what you might think of as the group of symmetries on an infinite line.

92
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,281
And in the same way that actions from the circle group could be associated with 

93
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:46,735
individual points on that circle, this is another one of those special groups where 

94
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:51,400
we can associate each action with a unique point on the thing that it's actually acting 

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,560
on.

96
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,780
You just follow where the point that starts at zero ends up.

97
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,880
For example, the number 3 is associated with the action of sliding right by 3 units.

98
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,741
The number negative 2 is associated with the action of sliding 2 units to the left, 

99
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:14,100
since that's the unique action that drags the point at zero over to the point at negative 

100
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,220
2.

101
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,440
The number zero itself, well, that's associated with the action of just doing nothing.

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,805
This group of sliding actions, each one of which is associated with a unique real number, 

103
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:29,280
has a special name, the additive group of real numbers.

104
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,461
The reason the word additive is in there is because of what the 

105
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:36,920
group operation of applying one action followed by another looks like.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,747
If I slide right by 3 units and then I slide right by 2 units, 

107
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:46,760
the overall effect is the same as if I slid right by 3 plus 2, or 5 units.

108
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,480
Simple enough, we're just adding the distances of each slide.

109
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,040
But the point here is that this gives an alternate view for what numbers even are.

110
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,408
They are one example in a much larger category of groups, 

111
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:04,001
groups of symmetries acting on some object, and the arithmetic of adding 

112
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:09,600
numbers is just one example of the arithmetic that any group of symmetries has within it.

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,659
We could also extend this idea, instead asking 

114
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,520
about the sliding actions on the complex plane.

115
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,750
The newly introduced numbers i, 2i, 3i, and so on on this vertical line would 

116
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,822
all be associated with vertical sliding motions, 

117
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:32,524
since those are the actions that drag the point at zero up to the relevant 

118
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,280
point on that vertical line.

119
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,313
The point over here at 3 plus 2i would be associated with the action of sliding 

120
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:47,080
the plane in such a way that drags zero up and to the right to that point.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,140
And it should make sense why we call this 3 plus 2i.

122
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,733
That diagonal sliding action is the same as first sliding by 3 to the right, 

123
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:02,240
and then following it with a slide that corresponds to 2i, which is 2 units vertically.

124
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,064
Similarly, let's get a feel for how composing 

125
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:09,480
any two of these actions generally breaks down.

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,077
Consider this slide by 3 plus 2i action, as well as this slide by 1 minus 3i action, 

127
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:19,880
and imagine applying one of them right after the other.

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,575
The overall effect, the composition of these two sliding actions, 

129
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:30,960
is the same as if we had slid 3 plus 1 to the right and 2 minus 3 vertically.

130
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,000
Notice how that involves adding together each component.

131
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,255
So composing sliding actions is another way to think 

132
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:42,320
about what adding complex numbers actually means.

133
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,857
This collection of all sliding actions on the 2d complex 

134
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:50,600
plane goes by the name the additive group of complex numbers.

135
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,287
Again, the upshot here is that numbers, even complex numbers, 

136
00:09:55,287 --> 00:10:00,606
are just one example of a group, and the idea of addition can be thought of in terms of 

137
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,420
successively applying actions.

138
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,835
But numbers, schizophrenic as they are, also lead a completely different life, 

139
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,960
as a completely different kind of group.

140
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,135
Consider a new group of actions on the number line, 

141
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:18,569
all ways that you can stretch or squish it, keeping everything evenly spaced, 

142
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,900
and keeping that number 0 fixed in place.

143
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,277
Yet again, this group of actions has that nice property, 

144
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:29,973
where we can associate each action in the group with a specific point on the 

145
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,560
thing that it's acting on.

146
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,240
In this case, follow where the point that starts at the number 1 goes.

147
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,020
There is one and only one stretching action that brings that point at 

148
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,220
1 to the point at 3, for instance, namely stretching by a factor of 3.

149
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,849
Likewise, there is one and only one action that brings that point 

150
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,940
at 1 to the point at 1 half, namely squishing by a factor of 1 half.

151
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,695
I like to imagine using one hand to fix the number 0 in place, 

152
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:01,932
and using the other to drag the number 1 wherever I like, 

153
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:06,620
while the rest of the number line just does whatever it takes to stay evenly spaced.

154
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,977
In this way, every single positive number is associated 

155
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:13,820
with a unique stretching or squishing action.

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,060
Now, notice what composing actions looks like in this group.

157
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,005
If I apply the stretch by 3 action, and then follow it with the stretch by 2 action, 

158
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:32,022
the overall effect is the same as if I had just applied the stretch by 6 action, 

159
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:34,500
the product of the two original numbers.

160
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,710
And in general, applying one of these actions followed by another 

161
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,900
corresponds with multiplying the numbers that they're associated with.

162
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,460
In fact, the name for this group is the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.

163
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,647
So, multiplication, ordinary familiar multiplication, 

164
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,311
is one more example of this very general and very far-reaching idea of groups, 

165
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:01,260
and the arithmetic within groups.

166
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,580
And we can also extend this idea to the complex plane.

167
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,216
Again, I like to think of fixing 0 in place with one hand, 

168
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:14,640
and dragging around the point at 1, keeping everything else evenly spaced while I do so.

169
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,763
But this time, as we drag the number 1 to places that are off the real number line, 

170
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:26,030
we see that our group includes not only stretching and squishing actions, 

171
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,260
but actions that have some rotational component as well.

172
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,414
The quintessential example of this is the action associated with that point at i, 

173
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:36,500
one unit above 0.

174
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,180
What it takes to drag the point at 1 to that point at i is a 90 degree rotation.

175
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,320
So, the multiplicative action associated with i is a 90 degree rotation.

176
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,996
And notice, if I apply that action twice in a row, 

177
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:57,500
the overall effect is to flip the plane 180 degrees.

178
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,960
And that is the unique action that brings the point at 1 over to negative 1.

179
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,136
So, in this sense, i times i equals negative 1, 

180
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:14,507
meaning the action associated with i, followed by that same action associated with i, 

181
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:19,620
has the same overall effect as the action associated with negative 1.

182
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,966
As another example, here's the action associated with 2 plus i, 

183
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:26,720
dragging 1 up to that point.

184
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,432
If you want, you could think of this as broken down as a rotation by 30 degrees, 

185
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,800
followed by a stretch by a factor of square root of 5.

186
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,888
And in general, every one of these multiplicative actions is some 

187
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,994
combination of a stretch or a squish, an action associated with some 

188
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:50,101
point on the positive real number line, followed by a pure rotation, 

189
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:55,220
where pure rotations are associated with points on this circle, the one with radius 1.

190
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,231
This is very similar to how the sliding actions in the additive group could be broken 

191
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:07,066
down as some pure horizontal slide, represented with points on the real number line, 

192
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:11,560
plus some purely vertical slide, represented with points on that vertical line.

193
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,512
That comparison of how actions in each group breaks down is going to be important, 

194
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:18,400
so remember it.

195
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,364
In each one, you can break down any action as some purely real number action, 

196
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:26,640
followed by something that's specific to complex numbers, 

197
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,745
whether that's vertical slides for the additive group, 

198
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,400
or pure rotations for the multiplicative group.

199
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,900
So that's our quick introduction to groups.

200
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,648
A group is a collection of symmetric actions on some mathematical object, 

201
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:48,620
whether that's a square, a circle, the real number line, or anything else you dream up.

202
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,098
And every group has a certain arithmetic, where you can combine 

203
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:56,718
two actions by applying one after the other, and asking what 

204
00:14:56,718 --> 00:15:00,160
other action from the group gives the same overall effect.

205
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,268
Numbers, both real and complex numbers, can be 

206
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:06,580
thought of in two different ways as a group.

207
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,067
They can act by sliding, in which case the group arithmetic just looks like 

208
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:17,143
ordinary addition, or they can act by these stretching-squishing-rotating actions, 

209
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:21,180
in which case the group arithmetic looks just like multiplication.

210
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,180
And with that, let's talk about exponentiation.

211
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,232
Our first introduction to exponents is to think 

212
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,880
of them in terms of repeated multiplication, right?

213
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,123
I mean, the meaning of something like 2 cubed is to take 2 times 2 times 2, 

214
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:42,400
and the meaning of something like 2 to the fifth is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.

215
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,388
And a consequence of this, something you might call the exponential property, 

216
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:53,190
is that if I add two numbers in the exponent, say 2 to the 3 plus 5, 

217
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,340
this can be broken down as the product of 2 to the third times 2 to the 5.

218
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,520
And when you expand things, this seems reasonable enough, right?

219
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,785
But expressions like 2 to the 1 half, or 2 to the negative 1, and much less 2 to the i, 

220
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:13,800
don't really make sense when you think of exponents as repeated multiplication.

221
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,820
I mean, what does it mean to multiply 2 by itself half of a time, or negative 1 of a time?

222
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,318
So we do something very common throughout math, 

223
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,643
and extend beyond the original definition, which only makes sense for counting numbers, 

224
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:30,100
to something that applies to all sorts of numbers.

225
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
But we don't just do this randomly.

226
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,375
If you think back to how fractional and negative exponents are defined, 

227
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,505
it's always motivated by trying to make sure that this property, 

228
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:45,700
2 to the x plus y equals 2 to the x times 2 to the y, still holds.

229
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,665
To see what this might mean for complex exponents, 

230
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:53,140
think about what this property is saying from a group theory light.

231
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,407
It's saying that adding the inputs corresponds with multiplying the outputs, 

232
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:02,710
and that makes it very tempting to think of the inputs not merely as numbers, 

233
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,800
but as members of the additive group of sliding actions.

234
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,782
And to think of the outputs not merely as numbers, 

235
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:13,460
but as members of this multiplicative group of stretching and squishing actions.

236
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,753
Now, it is weird and strange to think about functions that take in one kind of action, 

237
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:22,819
and spit out another kind of action.

238
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,020
But this is something that actually comes up all the time throughout group theory.

239
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,480
And this exponential property is very important for this association between groups.

240
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,289
It guarantees that if I compose two sliding actions, maybe a slide by negative 1, 

241
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:44,241
and then a slide by positive 2, it corresponds to composing the two output actions, 

242
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:49,980
in this case, squishing by 2 to the negative 1, and then stretching by 2 squared.

243
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,946
Mathematicians would describe a property like this by saying that the function preserves 

244
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:03,823
the group structure, in the sense that the arithmetic within a group is what gives it 

245
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:08,700
its structure, and a function like this exponential plays nicely with that arithmetic.

246
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,344
Functions between groups that preserve the arithmetic like 

247
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,165
this are really important throughout group theory, 

248
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:21,260
enough so that they've earned themselves a nice fancy name, homomorphisms.

249
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,997
Now, think about what all of this means for associating the additive group 

250
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:32,200
in the complex plane with the multiplicative group in the complex plane.

251
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,840
We already know that when you plug in a real number to 2 to the x, 

252
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,940
you get out a real number, a positive real number, in fact.

253
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,760
So this exponential function takes any purely horizontal slide, 

254
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,560
and turns it into some pure stretching or squishing action.

255
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,445
So wouldn't you agree that it would be reasonable for this new 

256
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,817
dimension of additive actions, slides up and down, 

257
00:18:56,817 --> 00:19:02,240
to map directly into this new dimension of multiplicative actions, pure rotations?

258
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,389
Those vertical sliding actions correspond to points on this vertical axis, 

259
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:13,517
and those rotating multiplicative actions correspond to points on the circle with 

260
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,080
radius 1.

261
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,238
So what it would mean for an exponential function like 2 to the x to map purely 

262
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:26,199
vertical slides into pure rotations would be that complex numbers on this vertical line, 

263
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:30,620
multiples of i, get mapped to complex numbers on this unit circle.

264
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,669
In fact, for the function 2 to the x, the input i, a vertical slide of one unit, 

265
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:43,789
happens to map to a rotation of about 0.693 radians, that is, 

266
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:49,240
a walk around the unit circle that covers 0.693 units of distance.

267
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,764
With a different exponential function, say 5 to the x, that input i, 

268
00:19:55,764 --> 00:20:02,190
a vertical slide of one unit, would map to a rotation of about 1.609 radians, 

269
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:08,040
a walk around the unit circle covering exactly 1.609 units of distance.

270
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,063
What makes the number e special is that when the exponential e to the x maps vertical 

271
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:20,135
slides to rotations, a vertical slide of one unit, corresponding to i, 

272
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:26,065
maps to a rotation of exactly one radian, a walk around the unit circle covering a 

273
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:27,780
distance of exactly one.

274
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,860
And so, a vertical slide of two units would map to a rotation of two radians.

275
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,100
A three unit slide up corresponds to a rotation of three radians.

276
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,215
And a vertical slide of exactly pi units up, corresponding to the input pi times i, 

277
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:51,360
maps to a rotation of exactly pi radians, halfway around the circle.

278
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,300
And that's the multiplicative action associated with the number negative one.

279
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,940
Now you might ask, why e?

280
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
Why not some other base?

281
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,160
Well, the full answer resides in calculus.

282
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,740
I mean, that's the birthplace of e and where it's even defined.

283
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,516
Again, I'll leave up another explanation on the screen if you're hungry 

284
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:12,580
for a fuller description and if you're comfortable with the calculus.

285
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,380
But at a high level, I'll say that it has to do with the fact that 

286
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,720
all exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative.

287
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,500
But e to the x alone is the one that's actually equal to its own derivative.

288
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,542
The important point that I want to make here, though, 

289
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,960
is that if you view things from the lens of group theory, 

290
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,086
thinking of the inputs to an exponential function as sliding actions, 

291
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,858
and thinking of the outputs as stretching and rotating actions, 

292
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:44,220
it gives a very vivid way to read what a formula like this is even saying.

293
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,152
When you read it, you can think that exponentials in general map purely vertical slides, 

294
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:55,242
the additive actions that are perpendicular to the real number line, into pure rotations, 

295
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:59,540
which are in some sense perpendicular to the real number stretching actions.

296
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,436
And moreover, e to the x does this in the very special way that ensures 

297
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:11,197
that a vertical slide of pi units corresponds to a rotation of exactly pi radians, 

298
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,500
the 180 degree rotation associated with the number negative 1.

299
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,270
To finish things off here, I want to show a way that you can think 

300
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,720
about this function e to the x as a transformation of the complex plane.

301
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,400
But before that, just two quick messages.

302
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,545
I've mentioned before just how thankful I am to you, the community, 

303
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:34,137
for making these videos possible through Patreon, 

304
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:38,648
but in much the same way that numbers become more meaningful when you think of them as 

305
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,500
actions, gratitude is also best expressed as an action.

306
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,700
So I've decided to turn off ads on new videos for their first month, 

307
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,780
in the hopes of giving you all a better viewing experience.

308
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,127
This video was sponsored by Emerald Cloud Lab, 

309
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:55,641
and actually I was the one to reach out to them on this one, 

310
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,580
since it's a company I find particularly inspiring.

311
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,460
Emerald is a very unusual startup, half software, half biotech.

312
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,931
The Cloud Lab that they're building essentially enables biologists and chemists 

313
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:11,620
to conduct research through a software platform, instead of working in a lab.

314
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,938
Scientists can program experiments, which are then executed remotely and robotically, 

315
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,140
in Emerald's industrialized research lab.

316
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,395
I know some of the people at the company, and the software 

317
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:24,620
challenges they're working on are really interesting.

318
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,058
Currently, they're looking to hire software engineers and web 

319
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,658
developers for their engineering team, as well as applied 

320
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:34,020
mathematicians and computer scientists for their scientific computing team.

321
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,820
If you're interested in applying, whether that's now or a few months from now, 

322
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,925
there are a couple special links in the description of this video, 

323
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:45,586
and if you apply through those, it lets Emerald know that you heard about them 

324
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:46,560
through this channel.

325
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,400
Alright, so e to the x transforming the plane.

326
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,495
I like to imagine first rolling that plane into a cylinder, 

327
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,163
wrapping all those vertical lines into circles, 

328
00:23:57,163 --> 00:24:01,776
and then taking that cylinder and kind of smooshing it onto the plane around zero, 

329
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:05,445
where each of those concentric circles, spaced out exponentially, 

330
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,280
correspond with what started off as vertical lines.
