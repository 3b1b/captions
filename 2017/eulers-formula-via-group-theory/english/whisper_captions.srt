00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,680
Two years ago, almost to the day actually, I put up the first video on this channel,

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,500
about Euler's formula, e to the pi i equals negative one.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,540
As an anniversary of sorts, I want to revisit that same idea.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,520
For one thing, I've always wanted to improve on the presentation, but I wouldn't rehash

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,560
an old topic if there wasn't something new to teach.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,580
You see, the idea underlying that video was to take certain concepts from a field in math

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,220
called group theory, and show how they give Euler's formula a much richer interpretation

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,240
than a mere association between numbers.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,020
And two years ago, I thought it might be fun to use those ideas without referencing group

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,200
theory itself, or any of the technical terms within it.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,140
But I've come to see that you all actually quite like getting into the math itself, even

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,060
if it takes some time.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,800
So here, two years later, lets you and me go through an introduction to the basics of

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,880
group theory, building up to how Euler's formula comes to life under this light.

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,020
If all you want is a quick explanation of Euler's formula, and if you're comfortable

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,120
with vector calculus, I'll put up a particularly short explanation on the screen that you can

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,240
pause and ponder on.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,700
If it doesn't make sense, don't worry about it, it's not needed for where we're

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,040
going.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,880
The reason I want to put out this group theory view, though, is not because I think it's

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,980
a better explanation.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,000
Heck, it's not even a complete proof, it's just an intuition really.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,800
It's because it has the chance to change how you think about numbers, and how you think

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,520
about algebra.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,860
You see, group theory is all about studying the nature of symmetry.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,640
For example, a square is a very symmetric shape, but what do we actually mean by that?

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,860
One way to answer that is to ask about what are all the actions you can take on the square

28
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,780
that leave it looking indistinguishable from how it started.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,500
For example, you could rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise, and it looks totally the

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,580
same to how it started.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,560
You could also flip it around this vertical line, and again, it still looks identical.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,460
In fact, the thing about such perfect symmetry is that it's hard to keep track of what

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,060
action has actually been taken, so to help out I'm going to stick on an asymmetric

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,040
image here.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,180
We call each one of these actions a symmetry of the square, and all of the symmetries together

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,320
make up a group of symmetries, or just group for short.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
This particular group consists of 8 symmetries.

38
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,820
There's the action of doing nothing, which is one we count, plus 3 different rotations,

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,040
and then there's 4 ways you can flip it over.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,600
In fact, this group of 8 symmetries has a special name, it's called the dihedral group

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,520
of order 8.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,780
And that's an example of a finite group, consisting of only 8 actions, but a lot of

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,260
other groups consist of infinitely many actions.

44
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,560
Think of all possible rotations, for example, of any angle.

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,660
Maybe you think of this as a group that acts on a circle, capturing all of the symmetries

46
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,460
of that circle that don't involve flipping it.

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,640
Here, every action from this group of rotation lies somewhere on the infinite continuum between

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,840
0 and 2 pi radians.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,360
One nice aspect of these actions is that we can associate each one of them with a single

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,800
point on the circle itself, the thing being acted on.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,620
You start by choosing some arbitrary point, maybe the one on the right here.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,560
Then every circle symmetry, every possible rotation, takes this marked point to some

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,920
unique spot on the circle, and the action itself is completely determined by where it

54
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,800
takes that spot.

55
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,180
Now, this doesn't always happen with groups, but it's nice when it does happen, because

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,680
it gives us a way to label the actions themselves, which can otherwise be pretty tricky to think about.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The study of groups is not just about what a particular set of symmetries is, whether

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,320
that's the 8 symmetries of a square, the infinite continuum of symmetries of the circle,

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
or anything else you dream up.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,200
The real heart and soul of the study is knowing how these symmetries play with each other.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,060
On the square, if I rotate 90 degrees and then flip around the vertical axis, the overall

62
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,760
effect is the same as if I had just flipped over this diagonal line.

63
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,660
So in some sense, that rotation plus the vertical flip equals that diagonal flip.

64
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,780
On the circle, if I rotate 270 degrees and then follow it with a rotation of 120 degrees,

65
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,920
the overall effect is the same as if I had just rotated 30 degrees to start with.

66
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:57,800
So in this circle group, a 270 degree rotation plus a 120 degree rotation equals a 30 degree rotation.

67
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,060
And in general, with any group, any collection of these sorts of symmetric actions, there's

68
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,960
a kind of arithmetic, where you can always take two actions and add them together to

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
get a third one, by applying one after the other.

70
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,980
Or maybe you think of it as multiplying actions, it doesn't really matter.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
The point is that there is some way to combine the two actions to get out another one.

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,600
That collection of underlying relations, all associations between pairs of actions and

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,180
the single action that's equivalent to applying one after the other, that's really what

74
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,640
makes a group a group.

75
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,980
It's actually crazy how much of modern math is rooted in, well, this, in understanding

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,000
how a collection of actions is organized by this relation, this relation between pairs

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,160
of actions and the single action you get by composing them.

78
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,740
Groups are extremely general.

79
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,460
A lot of different ideas can be framed in terms of symmetries and composing symmetries.

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,540
And maybe the most familiar example is numbers, just ordinary numbers.

81
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,820
And there are actually two separate ways to think about numbers as a group.

82
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,620
One where composing actions is going to look like addition, and another where composing

83
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,320
actions will look like multiplication.

84
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,720
It's a little weird, because we don't usually think of numbers as actions, we usually

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
think of them as counting things.

86
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,920
But let me show you what I mean.

87
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,160
Think of all of the ways that you can slide a number line left or right along itself.

88
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,100
This collection of all sliding actions is a group, what you might think of as the group

89
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,020
of symmetries on an infinite line.

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,400
And in the same way that actions from the circle group could be associated with individual

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,120
points on that circle, this is another one of those special groups where we can associate

92
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,560
each action with a unique point on the thing that it's actually acting on.

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,780
You just follow where the point that starts at zero ends up.

94
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,880
For example, the number 3 is associated with the action of sliding right by 3 units.

95
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,020
The number negative 2 is associated with the action of sliding 2 units to the left, since

96
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,220
that's the unique action that drags the point at zero over to the point at negative 2.

97
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,440
The number zero itself, well, that's associated with the action of just doing nothing.

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,420
This group of sliding actions, each one of which is associated with a unique real number,

99
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,280
has a special name, the additive group of real numbers.

100
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,500
The reason the word additive is in there is because of what the group operation of applying

101
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,920
one action followed by another looks like.

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,320
If I slide right by 3 units and then I slide right by 2 units, the overall effect is the

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,760
same as if I slid right by 3 plus 2, or 5 units.

104
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,480
Simple enough, we're just adding the distances of each slide.

105
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,040
But the point here is that this gives an alternate view for what numbers even are.

106
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,380
They are one example in a much larger category of groups, groups of symmetries acting on

107
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,940
some object, and the arithmetic of adding numbers is just one example of the arithmetic

108
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,600
that any group of symmetries has within it.

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,520
We could also extend this idea, instead asking about the sliding actions on the complex plane.

110
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,360
The newly introduced numbers i, 2i, 3i, and so on on this vertical line would all be associated

111
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,120
with vertical sliding motions, since those are the actions that drag the point at zero

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,280
up to the relevant point on that vertical line.

113
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,700
The point over here at 3 plus 2i would be associated with the action of sliding the

114
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,080
plane in such a way that drags zero up and to the right to that point.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,140
And it should make sense why we call this 3 plus 2i.

116
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,440
That diagonal sliding action is the same as first sliding by 3 to the right, and then

117
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,240
following it with a slide that corresponds to 2i, which is 2 units vertically.

118
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,480
Similarly, let's get a feel for how composing any two of these actions generally breaks down.

119
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Consider this slide by 3 plus 2i action, as well as this slide by 1 minus 3i action, and

120
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,880
imagine applying one of them right after the other.

121
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,880
The overall effect, the composition of these two sliding actions, is the same as if we

122
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,960
had slid 3 plus 1 to the right and 2 minus 3 vertically.

123
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,000
Notice how that involves adding together each component.

124
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,240
So composing sliding actions is another way to think about what adding complex numbers

125
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
actually means.

126
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
This collection of all sliding actions on the 2d complex plane goes by the name

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,600
the additive group of complex numbers.

128
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,880
Again, the upshot here is that numbers, even complex numbers, are just one example of a group,

129
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,420
and the idea of addition can be thought of in terms of successively applying actions.

130
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,020
But numbers, schizophrenic as they are, also lead a completely different life,

131
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,960
as a completely different kind of group.

132
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,600
Consider a new group of actions on the number line, all ways that you can stretch or squish it,

133
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,900
keeping everything evenly spaced, and keeping that number 0 fixed in place.

134
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,020
Yet again, this group of actions has that nice property, where we can associate each action in the group

135
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,560
with a specific point on the thing that it's acting on.

136
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,240
In this case, follow where the point that starts at the number 1 goes.

137
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,600
There is one and only one stretching action that brings that point at 1 to the point at 3, for instance,

138
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220
namely stretching by a factor of 3.

139
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,260
Likewise, there is one and only one action that brings that point at 1 to the point at 1 half,

140
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
namely squishing by a factor of 1 half.

141
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,900
I like to imagine using one hand to fix the number 0 in place,

142
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,240
and using the other to drag the number 1 wherever I like,

143
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,620
while the rest of the number line just does whatever it takes to stay evenly spaced.

144
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,820
In this way, every single positive number is associated with a unique stretching or squishing action.

145
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,060
Now, notice what composing actions looks like in this group.

146
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,960
If I apply the stretch by 3 action, and then follow it with the stretch by 2 action,

147
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,120
the overall effect is the same as if I had just applied the stretch by 6 action,

148
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,500
the product of the two original numbers.

149
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,660
And in general, applying one of these actions followed by another

150
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,900
corresponds with multiplying the numbers that they're associated with.

151
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,460
In fact, the name for this group is the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.

152
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,680
So, multiplication, ordinary familiar multiplication,

153
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,260
is one more example of this very general and very far-reaching idea of groups, and the arithmetic within groups.

154
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,580
And we can also extend this idea to the complex plane.

155
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,500
Again, I like to think of fixing 0 in place with one hand,

156
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,640
and dragging around the point at 1, keeping everything else evenly spaced while I do so.

157
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,820
But this time, as we drag the number 1 to places that are off the real number line,

158
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,840
we see that our group includes not only stretching and squishing actions,

159
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,260
but actions that have some rotational component as well.

160
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,580
The quintessential example of this is the action associated with that point at i,

161
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,500
one unit above 0.

162
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,180
What it takes to drag the point at 1 to that point at i is a 90 degree rotation.

163
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,320
So, the multiplicative action associated with i is a 90 degree rotation.

164
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,280
And notice, if I apply that action twice in a row,

165
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,500
the overall effect is to flip the plane 180 degrees.

166
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,960
And that is the unique action that brings the point at 1 over to negative 1.

167
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,840
So, in this sense, i times i equals negative 1,

168
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,680
meaning the action associated with i, followed by that same action associated with i,

169
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,620
has the same overall effect as the action associated with negative 1.

170
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,720
As another example, here's the action associated with 2 plus i, dragging 1 up to that point.

171
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,420
If you want, you could think of this as broken down as a rotation by 30 degrees,

172
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,800
followed by a stretch by a factor of square root of 5.

173
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,940
And in general, every one of these multiplicative actions is some combination of a stretch or a squish,

174
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,740
an action associated with some point on the positive real number line,

175
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,220
followed by a pure rotation, where pure rotations are associated with points on this circle, the one with radius 1.

176
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,000
This is very similar to how the sliding actions in the additive group

177
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,400
could be broken down as some pure horizontal slide, represented with points on the real number line,

178
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,560
plus some purely vertical slide, represented with points on that vertical line.

179
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,400
That comparison of how actions in each group breaks down is going to be important, so remember it.

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,440
In each one, you can break down any action as some purely real number action,

181
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,800
followed by something that's specific to complex numbers,

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,400
whether that's vertical slides for the additive group, or pure rotations for the multiplicative group.

183
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,900
So that's our quick introduction to groups.

184
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,580
A group is a collection of symmetric actions on some mathematical object,

185
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,620
whether that's a square, a circle, the real number line, or anything else you dream up.

186
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,300
And every group has a certain arithmetic, where you can combine two actions by applying one after the other,

187
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,160
and asking what other action from the group gives the same overall effect.

188
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,580
Numbers, both real and complex numbers, can be thought of in two different ways as a group.

189
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,700
They can act by sliding, in which case the group arithmetic just looks like ordinary addition,

190
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,460
or they can act by these stretching-squishing-rotating actions,

191
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,180
in which case the group arithmetic looks just like multiplication.

192
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,180
And with that, let's talk about exponentiation.

193
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,880
Our first introduction to exponents is to think of them in terms of repeated multiplication, right?

194
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,100
I mean, the meaning of something like 2 cubed is to take 2 times 2 times 2,

195
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,400
and the meaning of something like 2 to the fifth is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.

196
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,800
And a consequence of this, something you might call the exponential property,

197
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,580
is that if I add two numbers in the exponent, say 2 to the 3 plus 5,

198
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,340
this can be broken down as the product of 2 to the third times 2 to the 5.

199
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,520
And when you expand things, this seems reasonable enough, right?

200
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,260
But expressions like 2 to the 1 half, or 2 to the negative 1, and much less 2 to the i,

201
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,800
don't really make sense when you think of exponents as repeated multiplication.

202
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,820
I mean, what does it mean to multiply 2 by itself half of a time, or negative 1 of a time?

203
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,100
So we do something very common throughout math,

204
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,720
and extend beyond the original definition, which only makes sense for counting numbers,

205
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
to something that applies to all sorts of numbers.

206
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
But we don't just do this randomly.

207
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,520
If you think back to how fractional and negative exponents are defined,

208
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,300
it's always motivated by trying to make sure that this property,

209
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,700
2 to the x plus y equals 2 to the x times 2 to the y, still holds.

210
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,380
To see what this might mean for complex exponents,

211
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,140
think about what this property is saying from a group theory light.

212
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,960
It's saying that adding the inputs corresponds with multiplying the outputs,

213
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,220
and that makes it very tempting to think of the inputs not merely as numbers,

214
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,800
but as members of the additive group of sliding actions.

215
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,820
And to think of the outputs not merely as numbers,

216
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,460
but as members of this multiplicative group of stretching and squishing actions.

217
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,720
Now, it is weird and strange to think about functions that take in one kind of action,

218
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,820
and spit out another kind of action.

219
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,020
But this is something that actually comes up all the time throughout group theory.

220
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,480
And this exponential property is very important for this association between groups.

221
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,380
It guarantees that if I compose two sliding actions,

222
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,720
maybe a slide by negative 1, and then a slide by positive 2,

223
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,400
it corresponds to composing the two output actions,

224
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,980
in this case, squishing by 2 to the negative 1, and then stretching by 2 squared.

225
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,040
Mathematicians would describe a property like this by saying that the function preserves the group structure,

226
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,740
in the sense that the arithmetic within a group is what gives it its structure,

227
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,700
and a function like this exponential plays nicely with that arithmetic.

228
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,740
Functions between groups that preserve the arithmetic like this are really important throughout group theory,

229
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,260
enough so that they've earned themselves a nice fancy name, homomorphisms.

230
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,040
Now, think about what all of this means for associating the additive group in the complex plane

231
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,200
with the multiplicative group in the complex plane.

232
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,200
We already know that when you plug in a real number to 2 to the x, you get out a real number,

233
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,940
a positive real number, in fact.

234
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,940
So this exponential function takes any purely horizontal slide,

235
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,560
and turns it into some pure stretching or squishing action.

236
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,940
So wouldn't you agree that it would be reasonable for this new dimension of additive actions,

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,240
slides up and down, to map directly into this new dimension of multiplicative actions, pure rotations?

238
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,040
Those vertical sliding actions correspond to points on this vertical axis,

239
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,080
and those rotating multiplicative actions correspond to points on the circle with radius 1.

240
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,460
So what it would mean for an exponential function like 2 to the x to map purely vertical slides into pure rotations

241
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:30,620
would be that complex numbers on this vertical line, multiples of i, get mapped to complex numbers on this unit circle.

242
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,700
In fact, for the function 2 to the x, the input i, a vertical slide of one unit,

243
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,840
happens to map to a rotation of about 0.693 radians,

244
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,240
that is, a walk around the unit circle that covers 0.693 units of distance.

245
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,140
With a different exponential function, say 5 to the x, that input i, a vertical slide of one unit,

246
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,700
would map to a rotation of about 1.609 radians,

247
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:08,040
a walk around the unit circle covering exactly 1.609 units of distance.

248
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,900
What makes the number e special is that when the exponential e to the x maps vertical slides to rotations,

249
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,940
a vertical slide of one unit, corresponding to i, maps to a rotation of exactly one radian,

250
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,780
a walk around the unit circle covering a distance of exactly one.

251
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,860
And so, a vertical slide of two units would map to a rotation of two radians.

252
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,100
A three unit slide up corresponds to a rotation of three radians.

253
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,260
And a vertical slide of exactly pi units up, corresponding to the input pi times i,

254
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,360
maps to a rotation of exactly pi radians, halfway around the circle.

255
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,300
And that's the multiplicative action associated with the number negative one.

256
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,280
Now you might ask, why e? Why not some other base?

257
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,160
Well, the full answer resides in calculus.

258
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,740
I mean, that's the birthplace of e and where it's even defined.

259
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,700
Again, I'll leave up another explanation on the screen if you're hungry for a fuller description

260
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,580
and if you're comfortable with the calculus.

261
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,700
But at a high level, I'll say that it has to do with the fact that all exponential functions

262
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,720
are proportional to their own derivative.

263
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,500
But e to the x alone is the one that's actually equal to its own derivative.

264
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,020
The important point that I want to make here, though, is that if you view things from the lens of group theory,

265
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,640
thinking of the inputs to an exponential function as sliding actions,

266
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,500
and thinking of the outputs as stretching and rotating actions,

267
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,220
it gives a very vivid way to read what a formula like this is even saying.

268
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,880
When you read it, you can think that exponentials in general map purely vertical slides,

269
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,360
the additive actions that are perpendicular to the real number line,

270
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,540
into pure rotations, which are in some sense perpendicular to the real number stretching actions.

271
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:07,220
And moreover, e to the x does this in the very special way that ensures that a vertical slide of pi units

272
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,940
corresponds to a rotation of exactly pi radians,

273
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,500
the 180 degree rotation associated with the number negative 1.

274
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,540
To finish things off here, I want to show a way that you can think about this function e to the x

275
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,720
as a transformation of the complex plane.

276
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,400
But before that, just two quick messages.

277
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,460
I've mentioned before just how thankful I am to you, the community, for making these videos possible through Patreon,

278
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,600
but in much the same way that numbers become more meaningful when you think of them as actions,

279
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,500
gratitude is also best expressed as an action.

280
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,020
So I've decided to turn off ads on new videos for their first month,

281
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,780
in the hopes of giving you all a better viewing experience.

282
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,220
This video was sponsored by Emerald Cloud Lab,

283
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,580
and actually I was the one to reach out to them on this one, since it's a company I find particularly inspiring.

284
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,460
Emerald is a very unusual startup, half software, half biotech.

285
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:10,000
The Cloud Lab that they're building essentially enables biologists and chemists to conduct research through a software platform,

286
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,620
instead of working in a lab.

287
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,700
Scientists can program experiments, which are then executed remotely and robotically,

288
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,140
in Emerald's industrialized research lab.

289
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,620
I know some of the people at the company, and the software challenges they're working on are really interesting.

290
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,440
Currently, they're looking to hire software engineers and web developers for their engineering team,

291
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,020
as well as applied mathematicians and computer scientists for their scientific computing team.

292
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,980
If you're interested in applying, whether that's now or a few months from now,

293
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,060
there are a couple special links in the description of this video,

294
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,560
and if you apply through those, it lets Emerald know that you heard about them through this channel.

295
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,400
Alright, so e to the x transforming the plane.

296
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,680
I like to imagine first rolling that plane into a cylinder, wrapping all those vertical lines into circles,

297
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,400
and then taking that cylinder and kind of smooshing it onto the plane around zero,

298
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:08,280
where each of those concentric circles, spaced out exponentially, correspond with what started off as vertical lines.

299
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:24,260
