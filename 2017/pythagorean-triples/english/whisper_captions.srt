1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:10,300
When you first learned about the Pythagorean theorem, that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides on a right triangle

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,920
always equals the square of its hypotenuse,

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm guessing that you came to be pretty familiar with a few examples, like the 3-4-5 triangle, or the 5-12-13 triangle.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,360
And I think it's easy to take for granted that these even exist,

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,380
examples where the sum of two perfect squares happens to be a perfect square.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,020
But keep in mind for comparison, if you were to change that exponent to any whole number bigger than 2,

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,340
you go from having many integer solutions to no solutions whatsoever.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,980
This is Fermat's famous last theorem.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,220
Now there's a special name for any triplet of whole numbers, ABC, where a2 plus b2 equals c2.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,340
It's called a Pythagorean triple.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,760
And what we're going to do here is find every single possible example.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,020
And moreover, we'll do so in a way where you can visualize how all of these triples fit together.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,260
This is an old question, pretty much as old as they come in math.

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,840
There are some Babylonian clay tablets from 1800 BC, more than a millennium before Pythagoras himself,

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,920
that just list these triples.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,120
And by the way, while we're talking about the Pythagorean theorem,

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,880
it would be a shame not to share my favorite proof, for anyone who hasn't already seen this.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,800
You start off by drawing a square on each side of the triangle,

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,380
and if you take that c square and add four copies of the original triangle around it,

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,740
you can get a big square whose side lengths are a plus b.

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,720
But you can also arrange the a square and the b square together with four copies of the original triangle

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,940
to get a big square whose side lengths are a plus b.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,100
What this means is that the negative space in each of these diagrams,

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,160
the area of that big square minus four times the area of the triangle,

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,760
is from one perspective clearly a squared plus b squared,

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,240
but from another perspective it's c squared.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,700
Anyway, back to the question of finding whole number solutions.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,620
Start by reframing the question slightly.

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,500
Among all of the points on the plane with integer coordinates,

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,020
that is, all of these lattice points where grid lines cross,

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,420
which ones are a whole number distance away from the origin?

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,220
For example, the point 3,4 is a distance 5 away from the origin,

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,700
and the point 12,5 is a distance 13 away from the origin.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,000
The question of finding Pythagorean triples is completely equivalent to finding lattice points

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,740
which are a whole number distance away from the origin.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,160
Of course, for most points, like 2,1, the distance from the origin is not a whole number,

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,620
but it is at least the square root of a whole number.

38
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,040
In this case, 2 squared plus 1 squared is 5,

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,400
so that distance, that hypotenuse there, is the square root of 5.

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,240
Now, taking what might seem like a strange step,

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,620
but one which will justify itself in just a moment,

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,040
think of this as the complex plane,

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,440
so that every one of these points, like 2,1 here,

44
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,220
is actually an individual complex number, in this case 2 plus i.

45
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,160
What this gives is a surprisingly simple way to modify it

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,960
to get a new point whose distance away from the origin is guaranteed to be a whole number.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,460
Just square it.

48
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,240
Algebraically, when you square a complex number,

49
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,920
expanding out this product and matching up all of the like terms,

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,900
because everything here just involves multiplying and adding integers,

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,260
each component of the result is guaranteed to be an integer,

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,740
in this case you get 3 plus 4i.

53
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,080
But you can also think of complex multiplication more geometrically.

54
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,300
You take this line drawn from the origin to the number,

55
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,520
and consider the angle it makes with the horizontal axis,

56
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,200
as well as its length, which in this case is the square root of 5.

57
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,500
The effect of multiplying anything by this complex number

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,740
is to rotate it by that angle, and to stretch out by a factor equal to that length.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
So when you multiply the number by itself,

60
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
the effect is to double that angle, and importantly, to square its length.

61
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,680
Since the length started off as the square root of some whole number,

62
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,640
this resulting length is guaranteed to be a whole number, in this case 5.

63
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,660
Here, let's try it with another example.

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,580
Start off with some complex number that has integer coordinates, like 3 plus 2i.

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,100
In this case, the distance between this number and the origin

66
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,100
is the square root of 3 squared plus 2 squared, which is the square root of 13.

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,500
Now multiply this complex number by itself.

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,800
The real part comes out to 3 squared plus 2i squared, which is 9 minus 4,

69
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,180
and the imaginary part is 3 times 2 plus 2 times 3, so the result is 5 plus 12i,

70
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,600
and the magnitude of this new number is 13,

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,940
the square of the magnitude of our starting number, 3 plus 2i.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,860
So simply squaring our randomly chosen lattice point gives us the 512-13 triangle.

73
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,740
There's something kind of magical about actually watching this work.

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,220
It almost feels like cheating.

75
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,740
You can start with any randomly chosen lattice point, like 4 plus i,

76
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,640
and just by taking its square, you generate a pythagorean triple.

77
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,520
In this case, 4 plus i squared is 15 plus 8i, which has a distance 17 away from the origin.

78
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,100
If you play around with this, which I encourage you to do,

79
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,680
you'll find that some of the results are kind of boring.

80
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,340
If both the coordinates of your starting point are the same, or if one of them is zero,

81
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,320
then the triple at the end is going to include a zero.

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,380
For example, 2 plus 2i squared gives 8i,

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,020
and even though technically this is indeed a lattice point a whole number distance away from the origin,

84
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,760
the triple that it corresponds to is 0 squared plus 8 squared equals 8 squared,

85
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,520
which isn't exactly something to write home about.

86
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,380
But for the most part, this method of squaring complex numbers

87
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,940
is a surprisingly simple way to generate non-trivial pythagorean triples.

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,180
And you can even generalize it to get a nice formula.

89
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,700
If you write the coordinates of your initial point as u and v,

90
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,380
then when you work out u plus vi squared, the real part is u squared minus v squared,

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,540
and the imaginary part is 2 times uv.

92
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,820
The resulting distance from the origin is going to be u squared plus v squared.

93
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,880
It's kind of fun to work out this expression algebraically and see that it does indeed check out,

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,180
and it's also fun to plug in some random integers for u and v and get out a pythagorean triple.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,560
Essentially, we've created a machine where you give it any pair of integers,

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,080
and it gives you back some pythagorean triple.

97
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,460
A really nice way to visualize this, which will be familiar to any of you who watch the zeta

98
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,680
video, is to watch every point of z on the plane move over to the point z squared.

99
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,600
For example, the point 3 plus 2i is going to move over to 5 plus 12i.

100
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,820
The point i is going to rotate 90 degrees to its square, negative 1.

101
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,960
The point negative 1 is going to move over to 1, and so on.

102
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,700
Now when you do this to every single point on the plane, including the grid lines,

103
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,020
which I'll make more colorful so they're easier to follow,

104
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,420
here's what it looks like.

105
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,640
So the grid lines all get turned into these parabolic arcs,

106
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,600
and every point where these arcs intersect is a place where a lattice point landed,

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,500
so it corresponds to some pythagorean triple.

108
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,960
That is, if you draw a triangle whose hypotenuse is the line between any one of these points and

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,340
the origin, and whose legs are parallel to the axes, all three side lengths of that triangle

110
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,520
will be whole numbers.

111
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,560
What I love about this is that usually when you view pythagorean triples just on their own,

112
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,960
they seem completely random and unconnected, and you'd be tempted to say there's no pattern.

113
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,940
But here we have a lot of them sitting together really organized,

114
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,760
just sitting on the intersections of these nicely spaced curves.

115
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,500
Now you might ask if this accounts for every possible pythagorean triple.

116
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,780
Sadly, it does not.

117
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,400
For example, you will never get the point 6 plus 8i using this method,

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,960
even though 6 8 10 is a perfectly valid pythagorean triple.

119
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,680
There are simply no integers u and v where u plus vi squared is 6 plus 8i.

120
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480
Likewise, you will never hit 9 plus 12i.

121
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,320
But these don't really feel like anything new, do they,

122
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,900
since you can get each one of them by scaling up the familiar triple 3 4 5,

123
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,100
which is accounted for in our method.

124
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,440
In fact, for reasons that I'll explain shortly,

125
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,820
every possible pythagorean triple we miss is just some multiple of a different triple we hit.

126
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,880
To give another example, we miss the point 4 plus 3i.

127
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,660
There are no integers u and v, so that u plus vi squared is 4 plus 3i.

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,060
In fact, you'll never hit any points whose imaginary component is odd.

129
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,820
However, we do hit 8 plus 6i, that's 3 plus i squared.

130
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,620
So even though we miss 4 plus 3i, it's just one half times the point we do hit.

131
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
And by the way, you'll never have to scale down by anything smaller than one half.

132
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,660
A nice way to think about these multiples that we miss

133
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,420
is to take each point that we get using this squaring method

134
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,760
and draw a line from the origin through that point out to infinity.

135
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,400
Marking all of the lattice points that this line hits

136
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,880
will account for any multiples of these points that we might have missed.

137
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,220
Doing this for all possible points, you'll account for every possible pythagorean triple.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Every right triangle that you ever have seen or ever will see

139
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,180
that has whole number side lengths is accounted for somewhere in this diagram.

140
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,620
To see why, we'll now shift to a different view of the pythagorean triple problem,

141
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,880
one that involves finding points on a unit circle that have rational coordinates.

142
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,340
If you take the expression a squared plus b squared equals c squared

143
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:44,380
and divide out by that c squared, what you get is a over c squared plus b over c squared equals 1.

144
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,360
This gives us some point on the unit circle x squared plus y squared equals 1

145
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
whose coordinates are each rational numbers.

146
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,680
This is what we call a rational point of the unit circle.

147
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,580
And going the other way around, if you find some rational point on the unit circle

148
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,340
when you multiply out by a common denominator for each of those coordinates,

149
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,560
what you'll land on is a point that has integer coordinates

150
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,420
and whose distance from the origin is also an integer.

151
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,100
With that in mind, consider our diagram, where we squared every possible lattice point

152
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,700
and then drew these radial lines through each one

153
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,220
to account for any multiples that we might have missed.

154
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,200
If you project all of these points onto the unit circle,

155
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,280
each one moving along its corresponding radial line,

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,220
what you'll end up with is a whole bunch of rational points on that circle.

157
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,580
And keep in mind, by the way, I'm drawing only finitely many of these dots and lines,

158
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,100
but if I drew all infinitely many lines corresponding to every possible squared lattice point,

159
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,040
it would actually fill every single pixel of the screen.

160
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,520
Now if our method was incomplete, if we were missing a Pythagorean triple out there somewhere,

161
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,760
it would mean that there's some rational point on this circle

162
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,040
that we never hit once we project everything onto the circle.

163
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,100
And let me show you why that cannot happen.

164
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,720
Take any one of those rational points and draw a line between it and the point at negative 1.

165
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,680
When you compute the rise over run slope of this line,

166
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,240
the rise between the two points is rational and the run is also rational,

167
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,760
so the slope itself is just going to be some rational number.

168
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,720
So if we can show that our method of squaring complex numbers

169
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,940
accounts for every possible rational slope here,

170
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,420
it's going to guarantee that we hit every possible rational point of the unit circle, right?

171
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,580
Well, let's think through our method.

172
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,260
We start off with some point u plus vi that has integer coordinates,

173
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,160
and this number makes some angle off of the horizontal, which I'm going to call theta.

174
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,240
Squaring this number, the resulting angle off the horizontal,

175
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,220
is 2 times theta.

176
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,860
And of course, when you project that onto the unit circle,

177
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,040
it's along the same radial line,

178
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,020
so the corresponding rational point of the unit circle also has that same angle, 2 times theta.

179
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,700
And here, I'll bring in a nice little bit of circle geometry,

180
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,020
which is that any time you have an angle between two points

181
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,260
on the circumference of a circle and its center,

182
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,080
that turns out to be exactly two times the angle made by those same points

183
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,700
and any other point on the circle's circumference,

184
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,140
provided that that other point isn't between the original two points.

185
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,300
What this means for our situation is that the line between negative 1

186
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,360
and the rational point on the circle must make an angle theta with the horizontal.

187
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,500
In other words, that line has the same slope as the line between the origin

188
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,160
and our initial complex number, u plus vi.

189
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,480
But look at the rise over run slope of the line defined by our choice of integers, u and v.

190
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,220
The slope is v divided by u.

191
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,720
And of course, we can choose v and u to be whatever integers we want,

192
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,660
and therefore we do indeed account for every possible rational slope.

193
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,460
So there you go!

194
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,060
The radial lines from our method, determined by all possible choices of u and v,

195
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,840
must pass through every rational point on this circle.

196
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,400
And that means our method must hit every possible Pythagorean triple.

197
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,560
If you haven't already watched the video about pi hiding in prime regularities,

198
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,060
the topics there are highly related to the ones here.

199
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,300
Thank you!
