1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,982
When you first learned about the Pythagorean theorem, 

2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:11,095
that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides on a right triangle 

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:15,096
always equals the square of its hypotenuse, I'm guessing that you came 

4
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:18,927
to be pretty familiar with a few examples, like the 3-4-5 triangle, 

5
00:00:18,927 --> 00:00:20,280
or the 5-12-13 triangle.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,922
And I think it's easy to take for granted that these even exist, 

7
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:29,380
examples where the sum of two perfect squares happens to be a perfect square.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,338
But keep in mind for comparison, if you were to change that exponent to any whole number 

9
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:40,340
bigger than 2, you go from having many integer solutions to no solutions whatsoever.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,980
This is Fermat's famous last theorem.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,983
Now there's a special name for any triplet of whole numbers, 

12
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:51,220
ABC, where a2 plus b2 equals c2.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,340
It's called a Pythagorean triple.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,760
And what we're going to do here is find every single possible example.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,417
And moreover, we'll do so in a way where you can 

16
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:03,020
visualize how all of these triples fit together.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,260
This is an old question, pretty much as old as they come in math.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,072
There are some Babylonian clay tablets from 1800 BC, 

19
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:15,920
more than a millennium before Pythagoras himself, that just list these triples.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,528
And by the way, while we're talking about the Pythagorean theorem, 

21
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:22,988
it would be a shame not to share my favorite proof, 

22
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:24,880
for anyone who hasn't already seen this.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,298
You start off by drawing a square on each side of the triangle, 

24
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:34,375
and if you take that c square and add four copies of the original triangle around it, 

25
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,740
you can get a big square whose side lengths are a plus b.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,856
But you can also arrange the a square and the b square together with four copies 

27
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:46,940
of the original triangle to get a big square whose side lengths are a plus b.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,757
What this means is that the negative space in each of these diagrams, 

29
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:55,648
the area of that big square minus four times the area of the triangle, 

30
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,828
is from one perspective clearly a squared plus b squared, 

31
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:01,240
but from another perspective it's c squared.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,700
Anyway, back to the question of finding whole number solutions.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,620
Start by reframing the question slightly.

34
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,738
Among all of the points on the plane with integer coordinates, 

35
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:16,106
that is, all of these lattice points where grid lines cross, 

36
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:19,420
which ones are a whole number distance away from the origin?

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,719
For example, the point 3,4 is a distance 5 away from the origin, 

38
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,700
and the point 12,5 is a distance 13 away from the origin.

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,382
The question of finding Pythagorean triples is completely equivalent to 

40
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:37,740
finding lattice points which are a whole number distance away from the origin.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,276
Of course, for most points, like 2,1, the distance from the origin is not a whole number, 

42
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:47,620
but it is at least the square root of a whole number.

43
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,383
In this case, 2 squared plus 1 squared is 5, so that distance, 

44
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:55,400
that hypotenuse there, is the square root of 5.

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,003
Now, taking what might seem like a strange step, 

46
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:05,325
but one which will justify itself in just a moment, think of this as the complex plane, 

47
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:08,349
so that every one of these points, like 2,1 here, 

48
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,220
is actually an individual complex number, in this case 2 plus i.

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,808
What this gives is a surprisingly simple way to modify it to get a new 

50
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:20,960
point whose distance away from the origin is guaranteed to be a whole number.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,460
Just square it.

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,658
Algebraically, when you square a complex number, 

53
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:30,429
expanding out this product and matching up all of the like terms, 

54
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:34,484
because everything here just involves multiplying and adding integers, 

55
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:37,969
each component of the result is guaranteed to be an integer, 

56
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,740
in this case you get 3 plus 4i.

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,080
But you can also think of complex multiplication more geometrically.

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,600
You take this line drawn from the origin to the number, 

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,911
and consider the angle it makes with the horizontal axis, as well as its length, 

60
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,200
which in this case is the square root of 5.

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,627
The effect of multiplying anything by this complex number is to rotate it by that angle, 

62
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,740
and to stretch out by a factor equal to that length.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,306
So when you multiply the number by itself, the effect is to double that angle, 

64
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:12,840
and importantly, to square its length.

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,443
Since the length started off as the square root of some whole number, 

66
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:21,640
this resulting length is guaranteed to be a whole number, in this case 5.

67
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,660
Here, let's try it with another example.

68
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,580
Start off with some complex number that has integer coordinates, like 3 plus 2i.

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,219
In this case, the distance between this number and the origin is the 

70
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:38,100
square root of 3 squared plus 2 squared, which is the square root of 13.

71
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,500
Now multiply this complex number by itself.

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,051
The real part comes out to 3 squared plus 2i squared, which is 9 minus 4, 

73
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:54,500
and the imaginary part is 3 times 2 plus 2 times 3, so the result is 5 plus 12i, 

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,506
and the magnitude of this new number is 13, the square of the magnitude of our starting 

75
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:02,940
number, 3 plus 2i.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,860
So simply squaring our randomly chosen lattice point gives us the 512-13 triangle.

77
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,740
There's something kind of magical about actually watching this work.

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,220
It almost feels like cheating.

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,672
You can start with any randomly chosen lattice point, like 4 plus i, 

80
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:23,640
and just by taking its square, you generate a pythagorean triple.

81
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,444
In this case, 4 plus i squared is 15 plus 8i, 

82
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:30,520
which has a distance 17 away from the origin.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,186
If you play around with this, which I encourage you to do, 

84
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:36,680
you'll find that some of the results are kind of boring.

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,281
If both the coordinates of your starting point are the same, 

86
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:44,320
or if one of them is zero, then the triple at the end is going to include a zero.

87
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,425
For example, 2 plus 2i squared gives 8i, and even though technically 

88
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:54,296
this is indeed a lattice point a whole number distance away from the origin, 

89
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:59,356
the triple that it corresponds to is 0 squared plus 8 squared equals 8 squared, 

90
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:02,520
which isn't exactly something to write home about.

91
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,060
But for the most part, this method of squaring complex numbers is a 

92
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,940
surprisingly simple way to generate non-trivial pythagorean triples.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,180
And you can even generalize it to get a nice formula.

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,559
If you write the coordinates of your initial point as u and v, 

95
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:25,838
then when you work out u plus vi squared, the real part is u squared minus v squared, 

96
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,540
and the imaginary part is 2 times uv.

97
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,820
The resulting distance from the origin is going to be u squared plus v squared.

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,269
It's kind of fun to work out this expression algebraically and 

99
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,671
see that it does indeed check out, and it's also fun to plug in 

100
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:46,180
some random integers for u and v and get out a pythagorean triple.

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,536
Essentially, we've created a machine where you give it any pair of integers, 

102
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,080
and it gives you back some pythagorean triple.

103
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,599
A really nice way to visualize this, which will be familiar to any of you who watch the 

104
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,680
zeta video, is to watch every point of z on the plane move over to the point z squared.

105
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,600
For example, the point 3 plus 2i is going to move over to 5 plus 12i.

106
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,820
The point i is going to rotate 90 degrees to its square, negative 1.

107
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,960
The point negative 1 is going to move over to 1, and so on.

108
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,574
Now when you do this to every single point on the plane, including the grid lines, 

109
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:30,420
which I'll make more colorful so they're easier to follow, here's what it looks like.

110
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,937
So the grid lines all get turned into these parabolic arcs, 

111
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:43,861
and every point where these arcs intersect is a place where a lattice point landed, 

112
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:46,500
so it corresponds to some pythagorean triple.

113
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,965
That is, if you draw a triangle whose hypotenuse is the line between 

114
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:55,244
any one of these points and the origin, and whose legs are parallel to the axes, 

115
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:58,520
all three side lengths of that triangle will be whole numbers.

116
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,475
What I love about this is that usually when you view pythagorean 

117
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:05,793
triples just on their own, they seem completely random and unconnected, 

118
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,960
and you'd be tempted to say there's no pattern.

119
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,176
But here we have a lot of them sitting together really organized, 

120
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:15,760
just sitting on the intersections of these nicely spaced curves.

121
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,500
Now you might ask if this accounts for every possible pythagorean triple.

122
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,780
Sadly, it does not.

123
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,138
For example, you will never get the point 6 plus 8i using this method, 

124
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:39,960
even though 6 8 10 is a perfectly valid pythagorean triple.

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,680
There are simply no integers u and v where u plus vi squared is 6 plus 8i.

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480
Likewise, you will never hit 9 plus 12i.

127
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,761
But these don't really feel like anything new, do they, 

128
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:59,024
since you can get each one of them by scaling up the familiar triple 3 4 5, 

129
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,100
which is accounted for in our method.

130
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,121
In fact, for reasons that I'll explain shortly, 

131
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:09,349
every possible pythagorean triple we miss is just some multiple of a 

132
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,820
different triple we hit.

133
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,880
To give another example, we miss the point 4 plus 3i.

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,660
There are no integers u and v, so that u plus vi squared is 4 plus 3i.

135
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,060
In fact, you'll never hit any points whose imaginary component is odd.

136
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,820
However, we do hit 8 plus 6i, that's 3 plus i squared.

137
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,620
So even though we miss 4 plus 3i, it's just one half times the point we do hit.

138
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
And by the way, you'll never have to scale down by anything smaller than one half.

139
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,893
A nice way to think about these multiples that we miss is to 

140
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:49,214
take each point that we get using this squaring method and 

141
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,760
draw a line from the origin through that point out to infinity.

142
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,635
Marking all of the lattice points that this line hits will 

143
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:59,880
account for any multiples of these points that we might have missed.

144
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,220
Doing this for all possible points, you'll account for every possible pythagorean triple.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,148
Every right triangle that you ever have seen or ever will see that has 

146
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:18,180
whole number side lengths is accounted for somewhere in this diagram.

147
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,375
To see why, we'll now shift to a different view of the pythagorean triple problem, 

148
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:31,880
one that involves finding points on a unit circle that have rational coordinates.

149
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,763
If you take the expression a squared plus b squared equals c squared and divide out 

150
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:44,380
by that c squared, what you get is a over c squared plus b over c squared equals 1.

151
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,600
This gives us some point on the unit circle x squared plus y 

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
squared equals 1 whose coordinates are each rational numbers.

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,680
This is what we call a rational point of the unit circle.

154
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,692
And going the other way around, if you find some rational point on 

155
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,112
the unit circle when you multiply out by a common denominator for 

156
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:06,584
each of those coordinates, what you'll land on is a point that has 

157
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:10,420
integer coordinates and whose distance from the origin is also an integer.

158
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,873
With that in mind, consider our diagram, where we squared every 

159
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:18,046
possible lattice point and then drew these radial lines through 

160
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,220
each one to account for any multiples that we might have missed.

161
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,176
If you project all of these points onto the unit circle, 

162
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:28,092
each one moving along its corresponding radial line, 

163
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:32,220
what you'll end up with is a whole bunch of rational points on that circle.

164
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,012
And keep in mind, by the way, I'm drawing only finitely many of these dots and lines, 

165
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:42,265
but if I drew all infinitely many lines corresponding to every possible squared 

166
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:46,040
lattice point, it would actually fill every single pixel of the screen.

167
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,522
Now if our method was incomplete, if we were missing a Pythagorean triple 

168
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:55,229
out there somewhere, it would mean that there's some rational point on 

169
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:59,040
this circle that we never hit once we project everything onto the circle.

170
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,100
And let me show you why that cannot happen.

171
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,950
Take any one of those rational points and draw 

172
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,720
a line between it and the point at negative 1.

173
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,935
When you compute the rise over run slope of this line, 

174
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:17,772
the rise between the two points is rational and the run is also rational, 

175
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:21,760
so the slope itself is just going to be some rational number.

176
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,682
So if we can show that our method of squaring complex numbers accounts 

177
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:30,726
for every possible rational slope here, it's going to guarantee that 

178
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:34,420
we hit every possible rational point of the unit circle, right?

179
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,580
Well, let's think through our method.

180
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,266
We start off with some point u plus vi that has integer coordinates, 

181
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:48,160
and this number makes some angle off of the horizontal, which I'm going to call theta.

182
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,220
Squaring this number, the resulting angle off the horizontal, is 2 times theta.

183
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,586
And of course, when you project that onto the unit circle, 

184
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:03,245
it's along the same radial line, so the corresponding rational 

185
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:07,020
point of the unit circle also has that same angle, 2 times theta.

186
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,358
And here, I'll bring in a nice little bit of circle geometry, 

187
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,836
which is that any time you have an angle between two points on the 

188
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,522
circumference of a circle and its center, that turns out to be exactly 

189
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:22,312
two times the angle made by those same points and any other point on the 

190
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:26,101
circle's circumference, provided that that other point isn't between the 

191
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:27,140
original two points.

192
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,762
What this means for our situation is that the line between negative 1 and 

193
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:37,360
the rational point on the circle must make an angle theta with the horizontal.

194
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,324
In other words, that line has the same slope as the line 

195
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:46,160
between the origin and our initial complex number, u plus vi.

196
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,978
But look at the rise over run slope of the line defined by our choice of integers, 

197
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:52,480
u and v.

198
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,220
The slope is v divided by u.

199
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,390
And of course, we can choose v and u to be whatever integers we want, 

200
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,660
and therefore we do indeed account for every possible rational slope.

201
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,460
So there you go!

202
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,336
The radial lines from our method, determined by all possible choices of u and v, 

203
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:15,840
must pass through every rational point on this circle.

204
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,400
And that means our method must hit every possible Pythagorean triple.

205
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:42,409
If you haven't already watched the video about pi hiding in prime regularities, 

206
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:52,260
the topics there are highly related to the ones here.
