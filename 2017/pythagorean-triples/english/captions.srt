1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
When you first learned about the Pythagorean theorem, that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides on a right triangle

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,200
always equals the square of its hypotenuse,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm guessing that you came to be pretty familiar with a few examples, like the 3-4-5 triangle, or the 5-12-13 triangle.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,600
And I think it's easy to take for granted that these even exist,

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,720
examples where the sum of two perfect squares happens to be a perfect square.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,320
But keep in mind for comparison, if you were to change that exponent to any whole number bigger than 2,

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,720
you go from having many integer solutions to no solutions whatsoever.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,320
This is Fermat's famous last theorem.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,520
Now there's a special name for any triplet of whole numbers, ABC, where a2 plus b2 equals c2.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,720
It's called a Pythagorean triple.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,120
And what we're going to do here is find every single possible example.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,120
And moreover, we'll do so in a way where you can visualize how all of these triples fit together.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
This is an old question, pretty much as old as they come in math.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,120
There are some Babylonian clay tablets from 1800 BC, more than a millennium before Pythagoras himself,

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,120
that just list these triples.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,520
And by the way, while we're talking about the Pythagorean theorem,

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,120
it would be a shame not to share my favorite proof, for anyone who hasn't already seen this.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,120
You start off by drawing a square on each side of the triangle.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,320
And if you take that c square and add four copies of the original triangle around it,

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,120
you can get a big square whose side lengths are a plus b.

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,920
But you can also arrange the a square and the b square together with four copies of the original triangle

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,120
to get a big square whose side lengths are a plus b.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,320
What this means is that the negative space in each of these diagrams,

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
the area of that big square minus four times the area of the triangle,

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,520
is from one perspective clearly a squared plus b squared, but from another perspective it's c squared.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,920
Anyway, back to the question of finding whole number solutions.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
Start by reframing the question slightly.

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Among all of the points on the plane with integer coordinates,

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,320
that is, all of these lattice points where grid lines cross,

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,720
which ones are a whole number distance away from the origin?

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,320
For example, the point 3,4 is a distance 5 away from the origin.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
And the point 12,5 is a distance 13 away from the origin.

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,120
The question of finding Pythagorean triples is completely equivalent to finding lattice points

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
which are a whole number distance away from the origin.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,120
Of course, for most points, like 2,1, the distance from the origin is not a whole number.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,720
But it is at least the square root of a whole number.

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,120
In this case, 2 squared plus 1 squared is 5,

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,520
so that distance, that hypotenuse there, is the square root of 5.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Now, taking what might seem like a strange step, but one which will justify itself in just a moment,

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
think of this as the complex plane,

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,320
so that every one of these points, like 2,1 here, is actually an individual complex number,

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,320
in this case 2 plus i.

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,120
What this gives is a surprisingly simple way to modify it

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,920
to get a new point whose distance away from the origin is guaranteed to be a whole number.

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
Just square it.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,320
Algebraically, when you square a complex number,

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,120
expanding out this product and matching up all of the like terms,

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,120
because everything here just involves multiplying and adding integers,

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
each component of the result is guaranteed to be an integer.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,920
In this case, you get 3 plus 4i.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,120
But you can also think of complex multiplication more geometrically.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,320
You take this line drawn from the origin to the number,

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,520
and consider the angle it makes with the horizontal axis,

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,320
as well as its length, which in this case is the square root of 5.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,520
The effect of multiplying anything by this complex number

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,720
is to rotate it by that angle, and to stretch out by a factor equal to that length.

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,320
So when you multiply the number by itself,

58
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,920
the effect is to double that angle, and importantly, to square its length.

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,720
Since the length started off as the square root of some whole number,

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,720
this resulting length is guaranteed to be a whole number, in this case 5.

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Here, let's try it with another example.

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Start off with some complex number that has integer coordinates, like 3 plus 2i.

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
In this case, the distance between this number and the origin

64
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,320
is the square root of 3 squared plus 2 squared, which is the square root of 13.

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,720
Now multiply this complex number by itself.

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,920
The real part comes out to 3 squared plus 2i squared, which is 9 minus 4,

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,120
and the imaginary part is 3 times 2 plus 2 times 3.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,320
So the result is 5 plus 12i.

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,720
And the magnitude of this new number is 13,

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,920
the square of the magnitude of our starting number, 3 plus 2i.

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,920
So simply squaring our randomly chosen lattice point gives us the 512-13 triangle.

72
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,320
There's something kind of magical about actually watching this work.

73
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
It almost feels like cheating.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,320
You can start with any randomly chosen lattice point, like 4 plus i,

75
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,320
and just by taking its square, you generate a pythagorean triple.

76
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,320
In this case, 4 plus i squared is 15 plus 8i, which has a distance 17 away from the origin.

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
If you play around with this, which I encourage you to do,

78
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
you'll find that some of the results are kind of boring.

79
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,320
If both the coordinates of your starting point are the same, or if one of them is zero,

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,320
then the triple at the end is going to include a zero.

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,320
For example, 2 plus 2i squared gives 8i.

82
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,920
And even though technically this is indeed a lattice point a whole number distance away from the origin,

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,720
the triple that it corresponds to is 0 squared plus 8 squared equals 8 squared,

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,320
which isn't exactly something to write home about.

85
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
But for the most part, this method of squaring complex numbers

86
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,920
is a surprisingly simple way to generate non-trivial pythagorean triples.

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
And you can even generalize it to get a nice formula.

88
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,920
If you write the coordinates of your initial point as u and v,

89
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,920
then when you work out u plus vi squared, the real part is u squared minus v squared,

90
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
and the imaginary part is 2 times uv.

91
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,520
The resulting distance from the origin is going to be u squared plus v squared.

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,520
It's kind of fun to work out this expression algebraically and see that it does indeed check out.

93
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,520
And it's also fun to plug in some random integers for u and v and get out a pythagorean triple.

94
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Essentially, we've created a machine where you give it any pair of integers

95
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
and it gives you back some pythagorean triple.

96
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,520
A really nice way to visualize this, which will be familiar to any of you

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
watching the zeta function video, is to watch every point of z on the plane

98
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
move over to the point z squared.

99
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,520
So for example, the point 3 plus 2i is going to move over to 5 plus 12i.

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,520
The point i is going to rotate 90 degrees to its square, negative 1.

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
The point negative 1 is going to move over to 1, and so on.

102
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Now when you do this to every single point on the plane,

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
including the gridlines, which I'll make more colorful so they're easier to follow,

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
here's what it looks like.

105
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
So the gridlines all get turned into these parabolic arcs,

106
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
and every point where these arcs intersect is a place where a lattice point landed,

107
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
so it corresponds to some pythagorean triple.

108
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
That is, if you draw a triangle whose hypotenuse is the line between any one of these points

109
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120
and the origin, and whose legs are parallel to the axes,

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
all three side lengths of that triangle will be whole numbers.

111
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
What I love about this is that usually when you view pythagorean triples just on their own,

112
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,120
they seem completely random and unconnected, and you'd be tempted to say there's no pattern.

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,120
But here, we have a lot of them sitting together really organized,

114
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,120
just sitting on the inner sections of these nicely spaced curves.

115
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Now you might ask if this accounts for every possible pythagorean triple.

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Sadly, it does not.

117
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,720
For example, you will never get the point 6 plus 8i using this method,

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
even though 6, 8, 10 is a perfectly valid pythagorean triple.

119
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,720
There are simply no integers u and v where u plus vi squared is 6 plus 8i.

120
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Likewise, you will never hit 9 plus 12i.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,320
But these don't really feel like anything new, do they?

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Since you can get each one of them by scaling up the familiar triple, 3, 4, 5,

123
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
which is accounted for in our method.

124
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
In fact, for reasons that I'll explain shortly,

125
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,320
every possible pythagorean triple that we miss is just some multiple of a different triple that we hit.

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,320
To give another example, we miss the point 6 plus 8i,

127
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,920
there are no integers u and v so that u plus vi squared is 4 plus 3i.

128
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,920
In fact, you'll never hit any points whose imaginary component is odd.

129
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,920
However, we do hit 8 plus 6i, that's 3 plus i squared.

130
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,920
So even though we miss 4 plus 3i, it's just one half times the point we do hit.

131
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
And by the way, you'll never have to scale down by anything smaller than one half.

132
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
A nice way to think about these multiples that we miss

133
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,520
is to take each point that we get using this squaring method

134
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,520
and draw a line from the origin through that point out to infinity.

135
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Marking all of the lattice points that this line hits

136
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,520
will account for any multiples of these points that we might have missed.

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Doing this for all possible points,

138
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
you'll account for every possible point that you miss.

139
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Every possible Pythagorean triple,

140
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,520
every right triangle that you ever have seen or ever will see

141
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
that has whole number side lengths

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
is accounted for somewhere in this diagram.

143
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,520
To see why, we'll now shift to a different view of the Pythagorean triple problem,

144
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,520
one that involves finding points on a unit circle that have rational coordinates.

145
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
If you take the expression a squared plus b squared equals c squared

146
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
and divide out by that c squared,

147
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,120
what you get is a over c squared plus b over c squared equals one.

148
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
This gives us some point on the unit circle,

149
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
x squared plus y squared equals one,

150
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
whose coordinates are each rational numbers.

151
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
This is what we call a rational point of the unit circle.

152
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
And going the other way around,

153
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
if you find some rational point on the unit circle

154
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,120
when you multiply out by a common denominator for each of those coordinates,

155
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
what you'll land on is a point that has integer coordinates

156
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
and whose distance from the origin is also an integer.

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
With that in mind, consider our diagram

158
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
where we squared every possible lattice point

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
and then drew these radial lines through each one

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
to account for any multiples that we might have missed.

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720
If you project all of these points onto the unit circle,

162
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
each one moving along its corresponding radial line,

163
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
what you'll end up with is a whole bunch of rational points on that circle.

164
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Keep in mind, by the way,

165
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm drawing only finitely many of these dots and lines,

166
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
but if I drew all infinitely many lines

167
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
corresponding to every possible squared lattice point,

168
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
it would actually fill every single pixel of the screen.

169
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
If our method was incomplete,

170
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
if we were missing a Pythagorean triple out there somewhere,

171
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
it would mean that there's some rational point on this circle

172
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,320
that we never hit once we project everything onto the circle.

173
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
And let me show you why that cannot happen.

174
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Take any one of those rational points

175
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
and draw a line between it and the point at negative one.

176
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
When you compute the rise over run slope of this line,

177
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
the rise between the two points is rational

178
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
and the run is also rational,

179
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
so the slope itself is just going to be some rational number.

180
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
So if we can show that our method of squaring complex numbers

181
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
accounts for every possible rational slope here,

182
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,520
it's going to guarantee that we hit every possible rational point of the unit circle, right?

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Well, let's think through our method.

184
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,520
We start off with some point u plus vi that has integer coordinates,

185
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
and this number makes some angle off of the horizontal,

186
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
which I'm going to call theta.

187
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Squaring this number,

188
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
the resulting angle off the horizontal is 2 times theta.

189
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
And of course when you project that onto the unit circle,

190
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
it's along the same radial line,

191
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
so the corresponding rational point of the unit circle

192
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
also has that same angle, 2 times theta.

193
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
And here I'll bring in a nice little bit of circle geometry,

194
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
which is that any time you have an angle between two points

195
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
on the circumference of a circle and its center,

196
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
that turns out to be exactly 2 times the angle made by those same points

197
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
and any other point on the circle.

198
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
What this means for our situation

199
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
is that the line between negative 1 and the rational point on the circle

200
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
must make an angle theta with the horizontal.

201
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
In other words, that line has the same slope

202
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
as the line between the origin and our initial complex number, u plus vi.

203
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
But look at the rise over run slope,

204
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
which is the same as the line between the original and the original.

205
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
So the rise over run slope is the same as the line between the original

206
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
and the original,

207
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
but look at the rise over run slope of the line

208
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
defined by our choice of integers, u and v.

209
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
The slope is v divided by u.

210
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
And of course, we can choose v and u to be whatever integers we want,

211
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
and therefore we do indeed account for every possible rational slope.

212
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
So there you go!

213
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
The radial lines from our method,

214
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
determined by all possible choices of u and v,

215
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
must pass through every rational point on this circle,

216
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,920
and that means our method must hit every possible Pythagorean triple.

217
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,920
If you haven't already watched the video about pi hiding in prime regularities,

218
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
the topics there are highly related to the ones here.

219
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,920
Thank you for watching!
