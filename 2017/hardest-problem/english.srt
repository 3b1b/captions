1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Do you guys know about the Putnam? It's a math competition for undergraduate students.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,600
It's a six-hour long test that just has 12 questions broken up into two different

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,920
three-hour sessions. And each one of those questions is scored 1 to 10, so the highest

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,440
possible score would be 120. And yet, despite the fact that the only students taking this

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,500
thing each year are those who clearly are already pretty interested in math, the median

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,800
score is around 1 or 2. So it's a hard test. And on each one of those sections of six questions,

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,360
the problems tend to get harder as you go from 1 to 6, although of course difficulty

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,980
is in the eye of the beholder. But the thing about those fives and sixes is that even though

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,660
they're positioned as the hardest problems on a famously hard test, quite often these

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,020
are the ones with the most elegant solutions available, some subtle shift in perspective

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,180
that transforms it from very challenging to doable.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,380
Here I'm going to share with you one problem that came up as the sixth question on one

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,320
of these tests a while back. And those of you who follow the channel know that rather

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,440
than just jumping straight to the solution, which in this case would be surprisingly short,

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,380
when possible I like to take the time to walk you through how you might have stumbled across

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,020
the solution yourself, where the insight comes from. That is, make a video more about the

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,820
problem-solving process than about the problem used to exemplify it.

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,960
So anyway, here's the question. If you choose four random points on a sphere, and consider

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,500
the tetrahedron with these points as its vertices, what is the probability that the center of

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,300
the sphere is inside that tetrahedron? Go ahead, take a moment and kind of digest this

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,060
question. You might start thinking about which of these tetrahedra contain the sphere's

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,400
center, which ones don't, how you might systematically distinguish the two. And how

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,920
do you approach a problem like this? Where do you even start?

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,580
Well, it's usually a good idea to think about simpler cases, so let's knock things

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,200
down to two dimensions, where you'll choose three random points on a circle, and it's

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,360
always helpful to name things so let's call these guys P1, P2, and P3. The question is,

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,760
what's the probability that the triangle formed by these points contains the center

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
of the circle?

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:19,160
I think you'll agree it's way easier to visualize now, but it's still a hard question.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,360
So again, you ask, is there a way to simplify what's going on, get ourselves to some kind

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,020
of foothold that we can build up from? Well, maybe you imagine fixing P1 and P2 in place,

32
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,100
and only letting that third point vary. And when you do this, and play around with it

33
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,380
in your mind, you might notice that there's a special region, a certain arc, where when

34
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,860
P3 is in that arc, the triangle contains the center, otherwise not. Specifically, if

35
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,980
you draw lines from P1 and P2 through the center, these lines divide up the circle into

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,820
four different arcs, and if P3 happens to be in the one on the opposite side as P1 and

37
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,340
P2, the triangle has the center. If it's in any of the other arcs though, no luck.

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,380
We're assuming here that all of the points of the circle are equally likely. So what

39
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,620
is the probability that P3 lands in that arc? It's the length of that arc divided

40
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,940
by the full circumference of the circle, the proportion of the circle that this arc makes

41
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,340
up. So what is that proportion? Obviously that depends on where you put the first two

42
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,580
points. I mean, if they're 90 degrees apart from each other, then the relevant arc is

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,980
one quarter of the circle. But if those two points were farther apart, that proportion

44
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,980
would be something closer to a half, and if they were really close together, that proportion

45
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,860
gets closer to zero. So think about this for a moment. P1 and P2 are chosen randomly,

46
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,820
with every point on the circle being equally likely. So what is the average size of this

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,720
relevant arc? Maybe you imagine fixing P1 in place, and just considering all the places

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,000
that P2 might be. All of the possible angles between these two lines, every angle from

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,040
zero degrees up to 180 degrees, is equally likely. So every proportion between zero and

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,920
0.5 is equally likely, and that means that the average proportion is 0.25. So, if the

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,480
average size of this arc is a quarter of the full circle, the average probability that

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,080
the third point lands in it is a quarter, and that means that the overall probability

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:28,060
that our triangle contains the center is a quarter. But can we extend this into the

54
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,640
three-dimensional case? If you imagine three out of those four points just being fixed

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,900
in place, which points of the sphere can the fourth one be on so that the tetrahedron that

56
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,040
they form contain the center of the sphere? Just like before, let's go ahead and draw

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,560
some lines from each of those fixed three points through the center of the sphere, and

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,280
here it's also helpful if we draw some planes that are determined by any pair of these lines.

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,400
Now what these planes do, you might notice, is divide the sphere into eight different

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,120
sections, each of which is a sort of spherical triangle. And our tetrahedron is only going

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,260
to contain the center of the sphere if the fourth point is in the spherical triangle

62
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,420
on the opposite side as the first three. Now, unlike the 2D case, it's pretty difficult

63
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:21,420
to think about the average size of this section as we let the initial three points vary. Those

64
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,860
of you with some multivariable calculus under your belt might think, let's just try a

65
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,340
surface integral, and by all means, pull out some paper and give it a try. But it's not

66
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,500
easy. And of course it should be difficult, I mean, this is the sixth problem on a Putnam,

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,900
what do you expect? And what do you even do with that? Well, one thing you can do is back

68
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,180
up to the 2D case and contemplate if there is a different way to think about the same

69
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,920
answer we got. That answer, 1 fourth, looks suspiciously clean, and raises the question

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,700
of what that 4 represents. One of the main reasons I wanted to make a video about this

71
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,860
particular problem is that what's about to happen carries with it a broader lesson for

72
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,820
mathematical problem solving. Think about those two lines we drew for P1 and P2 through

73
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,060
the origin. They made the problem a lot easier to think about, and in general, whenever you've

74
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,540
added something to the problem setup that makes it conceptually easier, see if you can

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,840
reframe the entire question in terms of those things you just added. In this case, rather

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,880
than thinking about choosing three points randomly, start by saying, choose two random

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,140
lines that pass through the circle's center. For each line, there's two possible points

78
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,060
that it could correspond to, so just flip a coin for each one to choose which of the

79
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,860
end points is going to be P1, and likewise for the other, which end point is going to

80
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,260
be P2. Choosing a random line and flipping a coin like this is the same thing as choosing

81
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,020
a random point on the circle, it just feels a little convoluted at first. But the reason

82
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,900
for thinking about the random process this way is that things are actually about to become

83
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,940
easier. We'll still think about that third point, P3, as just being a random point on

84
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,700
the circle, but imagine that it was chosen before you do the two coin flips. Because

85
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,500
you see, once the two lines and the third point are set in stone, there's only four

86
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,220
possibilities for where P1 and P2 might end up, based on those coin flips, each one being

87
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,080
equally likely. But one and only one of those four outcomes leaves P1 and P2 on the opposite

88
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,540
side of the circle as P3, with the triangle they form containing the center. So no matter

89
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,760
where those two lines end up and where that P3 ends up, it's always a one-fourth chance

90
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,760
that the coin flips leave us with a triangle containing the center.

91
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,800
Now that's very subtle. Just by reframing how we think about the random process for

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,440
choosing points, the answer ¼ popped out in a very different way from how it did before.

93
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,280
And importantly, this style of argument generalizes seamlessly up into three dimensions. Again,

94
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,320
instead of starting off by picking four random points, imagine choosing three random lines

95
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,920
through the center of the sphere, and then some random point for P4. That first line

96
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,000
passes through the sphere at two points, so flip a coin to decide which of those two points

97
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,200
is going to be P1. Likewise, for each of the other lines, flip a coin to decide where P2

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,280
and P3 end up. There's eight equally likely outcomes of those coin flips, but one and

99
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,880
only one of them is going to place P1, P2, and P3 on the opposite side of the center

100
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,680
as P4. So one and only one of these eight equally likely outcomes gives us a tetrahedron

101
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,840
that contains the center. Again, it's kind of subtle how that pops out to us, but isn't

102
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,880
that elegant?

103
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,120
This is a valid solution to the problem, but admittedly the way I've stated it so far

104
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,160
rests on some visual intuition. If you're curious about how you might write it up in

105
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,720
a way that doesn't rely on visual intuition, I've left a link in the description to one

106
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
such write-up in the language of linear algebra, if you're curious. And this is pretty common

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,560
in math, where having the key insight and understanding is one thing, but having the

108
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,760
relevant background to articulate that understanding more formally is almost a separate muscle

109
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,000
entirely, one that undergraduate math students kind of spend most of their time building

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,440
up. But the main takeaway here is not the solution itself, but how you might find that

111
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,920
key insight if it was put in front of you and you were just left to solve it. Namely,

112
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,480
just keep asking simpler versions of the question until you can get some kind of foothold.

113
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,520
And then when you do, if there's any kind of added construct that proves to be useful,

114
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,680
see if you can reframe the whole question around that new construct.

115
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,200
To close things off here, I've got another probability puzzle, one that comes from this

116
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,920
video sponsor, brilliant.org. Suppose you have eight students sitting in a circle taking

117
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,780
the Putnam. It's a hard test, so each student tries to cheat off of his neighbor, choosing

118
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,240
randomly which neighbor to cheat from. Now circle all of the students that don't have

119
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,300
somebody cheating off of their test. What is the expected number of such circled students?

120
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,960
It's an interesting question, right? Brilliant.org is a site where you can practice your problem-solving

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,960
abilities with questions like this and many many more, and that really is the best way

122
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,080
to learn. You're going to find countless interesting questions curated in a pretty

123
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,360
thoughtful way so that you really do come away better at problem solving. If you want

124
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,200
more probability, they have a really good course on probability, but they've got all

125
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,580
sorts of other math and science as well, so you're almost certainly going to find something

126
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,480
that interests you. Me, I've been a fan for a while, and if you go to brilliant.org

127
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,560
slash 3b1b, it lets them know that you came from here, and the first 256 of you to visit

130
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,360
tactic in probability that's useful in a lot of other circumstances, I also left a link

131
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,660
in the description that just jumps you straight to the solution.
