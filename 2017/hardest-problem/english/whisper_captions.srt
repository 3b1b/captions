1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,160
Do you guys know about the Putnam? It's a math competition for undergraduate students.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,580
It's a six-hour long test that just has 12 questions broken up into two different

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,900
three-hour sessions. And each one of those questions is scored 1 to 10, so the highest

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,500
possible score would be 120. And yet, despite the fact that the only students taking this

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,480
thing each year are those who clearly are already pretty interested in math, the median

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,340
score is around 1 or 2. So it's a hard test. And on each one of those sections of six questions,

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,360
the problems tend to get harder as you go from 1 to 6, although of course difficulty

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,060
is in the eye of the beholder. But the thing about those fives and sixes is that even though

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,720
they're positioned as the hardest problems on a famously hard test, quite often these

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,000
are the ones with the most elegant solutions available, some subtle shift in perspective

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,060
that transforms it from very challenging to doable. Here I'm going to share with you

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,460
one problem that came up as the sixth question on one of these tests a while back. And those

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,920
of you who follow the channel know that rather than just jumping straight to the solution,

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,260
which in this case would be surprisingly short, when possible I like to take the time to walk

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,680
you through how you might have stumbled across the solution yourself, where the insight comes

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
from. That is, make a video more about the problem-solving process than about the problem

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,520
used to exemplify it. So anyway, here's the question. If you choose four random points

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,620
on a sphere, and consider the tetrahedron with these points as its vertices, what is

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,020
the probability that the center of the sphere is inside that tetrahedron? Go ahead, take

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,420
a moment and kind of digest this question. You might start thinking about which of these

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,820
tetrahedra contain the sphere's center, which ones don't, how you might systematically distinguish

22
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:51,240
the two, and how do you approach a problem like this? Where do you even start? Well,

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,820
it's usually a good idea to think about simpler cases, so let's knock things down

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,300
to two dimensions, where you'll choose three random points on a circle, and it's always

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,480
helpful to name things so let's call these guys P1, P2, and P3. The question is, what's

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,400
the probability that the triangle formed by these points contains the center of the circle?

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,680
I think you'll agree it's way easier to visualize now, but it's still a hard question.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,420
So again, you ask, is there a way to simplify what's going on, get ourselves to some kind

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,740
of foothold that we can build up from? Well, maybe you imagine fixing P1 and P2 in place,

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,160
and only letting that third point vary. And when you do this, and play around with it

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,500
in your mind, you might notice that there's a special region, a certain arc, where when

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,940
P3 is in that arc, the triangle contains the center, otherwise not. Specifically, if

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,060
you draw lines from P1 and P2 through the center, these lines divide up the circle into

34
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,460
four different arcs, and if P3 happens to be in the one on the opposite side as P1 and

35
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,180
P2, the triangle has the center. If it's in any of the other arcs though, no luck.

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,400
We're assuming here that all of the points of the circle are equally likely. So what

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,600
is the probability that P3 lands in that arc? It's the length of that arc divided

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,880
by the full circumference of the circle, the proportion of the circle that this arc makes

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,460
up. So what is that proportion? Obviously that depends on where you put the first two

40
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,720
points. I mean, if they're 90 degrees apart from each other, then the relevant arc is

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,960
one quarter of the circle. But if those two points were farther apart, that proportion

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,980
would be something closer to a half, and if they were really close together, that proportion

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,520
gets closer to zero. So think about this for a moment. P1 and P2 are chosen randomly,

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,860
with every point on the circle being equally likely. So what is the average size of this

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,700
relevant arc? Maybe you imagine fixing P1 in place, and just considering all the places

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,080
that P2 might be. All of the possible angles between these two lines, every angle from

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,620
0 degrees up to 180 degrees, is equally likely. So every proportion between 0 and 0.5 is equally

48
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:10,020
likely, and that means that the average proportion is 0.25. So, if the average size of this arc

49
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,520
is a quarter of the full circle, the average probability that the third point lands in

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,780
it is a quarter, and that means that the overall probability that our triangle contains the

51
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:30,360
center is a quarter. But can we extend this into the three-dimensional case? If you imagine

52
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,940
three out of those four points just being fixed in place, which points of the sphere

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,200
can the fourth one be on so that the tetrahedron that they form contain the center of the sphere?

54
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,280
Just like before, let's go ahead and draw some lines from each of those fixed three

55
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,720
points through the center of the sphere. It's also helpful if we draw some planes

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,140
that are determined by any pair of these lines. What these planes do, you might notice, is

57
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,460
divide the sphere into eight different sections, each of which is a sort of spherical triangle.

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,200
And our tetrahedron is only going to contain the center of the sphere if the fourth point

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,880
is in the spherical triangle on the opposite side as the first three. Now, unlike the 2D

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,820
case, it's pretty difficult to think about the average size of this section, as we let

61
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,440
the initial three points vary. Those of you with some multivariable calculus under your

62
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,160
belt might think, let's just try a surface integral. And by all means, pull out some

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,440
paper and give it a try. But it's not easy. And of course it should be difficult. I mean,

64
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,240
this is the sixth problem on a Putnam, what do you expect? And what do you even do with

65
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,880
that? Well, one thing you can do is back up to the two-dimensional case and contemplate

66
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,860
if there is a different way to think about the same answer we got. That answer, one-fourth,

67
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,140
looks suspiciously clean, and raises the question of what that four represents. One of the main

68
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,520
reasons I wanted to make a video about this particular problem is that what's about

69
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,120
to happen carries with it a broader lesson for mathematical problem solving. Think about

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,220
those two lines we drew for p1 and p2 through the origin. They made the problem a lot easier

71
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,060
to think about. And in general, whenever you've added something to the problem setup that

72
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,020
makes it conceptually easier, see if you can reframe the entire question in terms of those

73
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,860
things you just added. In this case, rather than choosing three points randomly, start

74
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,000
by saying, choose two random lines that pass through the circle's center. For each line,

75
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,540
there's two possible points it could correspond to, so just flip a coin for each one to choose

76
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,520
which of the endpoints is going to be p1, and likewise for the other, which endpoint

77
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,300
is going to be p2. Choosing a random line and flipping a coin like this is the same

78
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,060
thing as choosing a random point on the circle, it just feels a little bit convoluted at first.

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,380
But the reason for thinking about the random process this way is that things are actually

80
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,120
about to become easier. We'll still think about that third point, p3, as just being

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,360
a random point on the circle, but imagine that it was chosen before you do the two coin

82
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,180
flips. Once the two lines and the third point are set in stone, there's only four possibilities

83
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,060
for where p1 and p2 might end up, based on those coin flips, each one being equally likely.

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,640
But one and only one of those four outcomes leaves p1 and p2 on the opposite side of the

85
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,820
circle as p3, with the triangle they form containing the center. So no matter where

86
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,880
those two lines end up, and where that p3 ends up, it's always a 1 fourth chance that

87
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,740
the coin flips leave us with a triangle containing the center.

88
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,860
Now that's very subtle. Just by reframing how we think about the random process for

89
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,140
choosing points, the answer 1 quarter popped out in a very different way from how it did

90
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,560
before. And importantly, this style of argument generalizes seamlessly up into three dimensions.

91
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,180
Again, instead of starting off by picking four random points, imagine choosing three

92
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,700
random lines through the center of the sphere, and then some random point for p4. That first

93
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,700
line passes through the sphere at two points, so flip a coin to decide which of those two

94
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,200
points is going to be p1. Likewise, for each of the other lines, flip a coin to decide

95
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,940
where p2 and p3 end up. There's eight equally likely outcomes of those coin flips, but one

96
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,700
and only one of them is going to place p1, p2, and p3 on the opposite side of the center

97
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,480
as p4. So one and only one of these eight equally likely outcomes gives us a tetrahedron

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,860
that contains the center. Again, it's kind of subtle how that pops out to us, but isn't

99
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,340
that elegant?

100
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,960
This is a valid solution to the problem, but admittedly the way I've stated it so far

101
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
rests on some visual intuition. If you're curious about how you might write it up in

102
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,760
a way that doesn't rely on visual intuition, I've left a link in the description to one

103
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,140
such write-up in the language of linear algebra, if you're curious. And this is pretty common

104
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,680
in math, where having the key insight and understanding is one thing, but having the

105
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,700
relevant background to articulate that understanding more formally is almost a separate muscle

106
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,880
entirely, one that undergraduate math students kind of spend most of their time building

107
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,500
up. But the main takeaway here is not the solution itself, but how you might find that

108
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,680
key insight if it was put in front of you and you were just left to solve it. Namely,

109
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,500
just keep asking simpler versions of the question until you can get some kind of foothold. And

110
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,780
then when you do, if there's any kind of added construct that proves to be useful,

111
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,540
see if you can reframe the whole question around that new construct.

112
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,260
To close things off here, I've got another probability puzzle, one that comes from this

113
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,960
video sponsor, brilliant.org. Suppose you have eight students sitting in a circle taking

114
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,820
the Putnam. It's a hard test, so each student tries to cheat off of his neighbor, choosing

115
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,320
randomly which neighbor to cheat from. Now circle all of the students that don't have

116
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,980
somebody cheating off of their test. What is the expected number of such circled students?

117
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,720
It's an interesting question, right? Brilliant.org is a site where you can practice your problem

118
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,700
solving abilities with questions like this and many, many more. And that really is the

119
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,840
best way to learn. You're going to find countless interesting questions curated in

120
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,180
a pretty thoughtful way so that you really do come away better at problem solving. If

121
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,960
you want more probability, they have a really good course on probability, but they've

122
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,120
got all sorts of other math and science as well, so you're almost certainly going to

123
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,460
find something that interests you. Me? I've been a fan for a while, and if you go to brilliant.org

124
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:36,580
slash 3b1b, it lets them know that you came from here, and the first 256 of you to visit

125
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,820
that link can get 20% off their premium membership, which is the one I use, if you want to upgrade.

126
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,160
Also if you're just itching to see a solution to this puzzle, which by the way uses a certain

127
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,300
tactic in probability that's useful in a lot of other circumstances, I also left a

128
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,620
link in the description that just jumps you straight to the solution.
