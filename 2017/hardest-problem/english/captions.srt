1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,320
Do you guys know about the Putnam?

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,160
It's a math competition for undergraduate students.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,203
It's a six-hour long test that just has 12 questions 

4
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:13,500
broken up into two different three-hour sessions.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,696
And each one of those questions is scored 1 to 10, 

6
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:18,920
so the highest possible score would be 120.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,060
And yet, despite the fact that the only students taking this thing each year are those 

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,360
who clearly are already pretty interested in math, the median score is around 1 or 2.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,740
So it's a hard test.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,965
And on each one of those sections of six questions, 

11
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,679
the problems tend to get harder as you go from 1 to 6, 

12
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,640
although of course difficulty is in the eye of the beholder.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,783
But the thing about those fives and sixes is that even though they're 

14
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,975
positioned as the hardest problems on a famously hard test, 

15
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:50,911
quite often these are the ones with the most elegant solutions available, 

16
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,380
some subtle shift in perspective that transforms it from very challenging to doable.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,440
Here I'm going to share with you one problem that came up 

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,760
as the sixth question on one of these tests a while back.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,560
And those of you who follow the channel know that rather than just jumping 

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,776
straight to the solution, which in this case would be surprisingly short, 

21
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,906
when possible I like to take the time to walk you through how you might 

22
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:14,080
have stumbled across the solution yourself, where the insight comes from.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,175
That is, make a video more about the problem-solving 

24
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,800
process than about the problem used to exemplify it.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,460
So anyway, here's the question.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,348
If you choose four random points on a sphere, and consider the 

27
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,025
tetrahedron with these points as its vertices, 

28
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:32,640
what is the probability that the center of the sphere is inside that tetrahedron?

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,640
Go ahead, take a moment and kind of digest this question.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,118
You might start thinking about which of these tetrahedra contain the sphere's center, 

31
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,786
which ones don't, how you might systematically distinguish the two, 

32
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:48,160
and how do you approach a problem like this?

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,500
Where do you even start?

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,322
Well, it's usually a good idea to think about simpler cases, 

35
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,599
so let's knock things down to two dimensions, where you'll choose three random 

36
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,364
points on a circle, and it's always helpful to name things so let's call these guys P1, 

37
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:03,960
P2, and P3.

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,455
The question is, what's the probability that the triangle 

39
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:10,400
formed by these points contains the center of the circle?

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,680
I think you'll agree it's way easier to visualize now, but it's still a hard question.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,021
So again, you ask, is there a way to simplify what's going on, 

42
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:25,180
get ourselves to some kind of foothold that we can build up from?

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,800
Well, maybe you imagine fixing P1 and P2 in place, and only letting that third point vary.

44
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,422
And when you do this, and play around with it in your mind, 

45
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,576
you might notice that there's a special region, a certain arc, 

46
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:41,480
where when P3 is in that arc, the triangle contains the center, otherwise not.

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,338
Specifically, if you draw lines from P1 and P2 through the center, 

48
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:49,683
these lines divide up the circle into four different arcs, 

49
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:53,652
and if P3 happens to be in the one on the opposite side as P1 and P2, 

50
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,240
the triangle has the center.

51
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,180
If it's in any of the other arcs though, no luck.

52
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,180
We're assuming here that all of the points of the circle are equally likely.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,700
So what is the probability that P3 lands in that arc?

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,707
It's the length of that arc divided by the full circumference of the circle, 

55
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:15,360
the proportion of the circle that this arc makes up.

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,860
So what is that proportion?

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,820
Obviously that depends on where you put the first two points.

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,674
I mean, if they're 90 degrees apart from each other, 

59
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:24,940
then the relevant arc is one quarter of the circle.

60
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,077
But if those two points were farther apart, that proportion would be something closer 

61
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,980
to a half, and if they were really close together, that proportion gets closer to zero.

62
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,400
So think about this for a moment.

63
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,900
P1 and P2 are chosen randomly, with every point on the circle being equally likely.

64
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,640
So what is the average size of this relevant arc?

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,566
Maybe you imagine fixing P1 in place, and just 

66
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:50,800
considering all the places that P2 might be.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,563
All of the possible angles between these two lines, 

68
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:58,260
every angle from 0 degrees up to 180 degrees, is equally likely.

69
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,841
So every proportion between 0 and 0.5 is equally likely, 

70
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:06,440
and that means that the average proportion is 0.25.

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,015
So, if the average size of this arc is a quarter of the full circle, 

72
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:16,003
the average probability that the third point lands in it is a quarter, 

73
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:20,216
and that means that the overall probability that our triangle contains the 

74
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,339
center is a quarter.

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,140
But can we extend this into the three-dimensional case?

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,653
If you imagine three out of those four points just being fixed in place, 

77
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:37,032
which points of the sphere can the fourth one be on so that the 

78
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:40,200
tetrahedron that they form contain the center of the sphere?

79
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,382
Just like before, let's go ahead and draw some lines from each 

80
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,980
of those fixed three points through the center of the sphere.

81
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,180
It's also helpful if we draw some planes that are determined by any pair of these lines.

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,724
What these planes do, you might notice, is divide the sphere into 

83
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:00,460
eight different sections, each of which is a sort of spherical triangle.

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,705
And our tetrahedron is only going to contain the center of the sphere if the 

85
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:10,460
fourth point is in the spherical triangle on the opposite side as the first three.

86
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,846
Now, unlike the 2D case, it's pretty difficult to think about the 

87
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:18,480
average size of this section, as we let the initial three points vary.

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,233
Those of you with some multivariable calculus under your belt might think, 

89
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,600
let's just try a surface integral.

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,200
And by all means, pull out some paper and give it a try.

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,620
But it's not easy.

92
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,100
And of course it should be difficult.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,000
I mean, this is the sixth problem on a Putnam, what do you expect?

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,520
And what do you even do with that?

95
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,342
Well, one thing you can do is back up to the two-dimensional case and 

96
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,000
contemplate if there is a different way to think about the same answer we got.

97
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,644
That answer, one-fourth, looks suspiciously clean, 

98
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:52,580
and raises the question of what that four represents.

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,377
One of the main reasons I wanted to make a video about this particular problem is that 

100
00:05:57,377 --> 00:06:01,120
what's about to happen carries with it a broader lesson for mathematical problem solving.

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,360
Think about those two lines we drew for p1 and p2 through the origin.

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,900
They made the problem a lot easier to think about.

103
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,601
And in general, whenever you've added something to the problem 

104
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,976
setup that makes it conceptually easier, see if you can reframe 

105
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:18,140
the entire question in terms of those things you just added.

106
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,615
In this case, rather than choosing three points randomly, start by saying, 

107
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:27,580
choose two random lines that pass through the circle's center.

108
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,662
For each line, there's two possible points it could correspond to, 

109
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:35,724
so just flip a coin for each one to choose which of the endpoints is going to be p1, 

110
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:38,640
and likewise for the other, which endpoint is going to be p2.

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,344
Choosing a random line and flipping a coin like this is the same thing as choosing 

112
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:47,060
a random point on the circle, it just feels a little bit convoluted at first.

113
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,064
But the reason for thinking about the random process this 

114
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:52,440
way is that things are actually about to become easier.

115
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,287
We'll still think about that third point, p3, as just being a random point on the circle, 

116
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,720
but imagine that it was chosen before you do the two coin flips.

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,885
Once the two lines and the third point are set in stone, 

118
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:09,735
there's only four possibilities for where p1 and p2 might end up, 

119
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:13,060
based on those coin flips, each one being equally likely.

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,581
But one and only one of those four outcomes leaves p1 and p2 on the opposite 

121
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:23,420
side of the circle as p3, with the triangle they form containing the center.

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,617
So no matter where those two lines end up, and where that p3 ends up, 

123
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:32,159
it's always a 1 fourth chance that the coin flips leave us with a triangle containing 

124
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,740
the center.

125
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,460
Now that's very subtle.

126
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,761
Just by reframing how we think about the random process for choosing points, 

127
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:44,580
the answer 1 quarter popped out in a very different way from how it did before.

128
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,560
And importantly, this style of argument generalizes seamlessly up into three dimensions.

129
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,173
Again, instead of starting off by picking four random points, 

130
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:59,162
imagine choosing three random lines through the center of the sphere, 

131
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,100
and then some random point for p4.

132
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,797
That first line passes through the sphere at two points, 

133
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:09,160
so flip a coin to decide which of those two points is going to be p1.

134
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Likewise, for each of the other lines, flip a coin to decide where p2 and p3 end up.

135
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,942
There's eight equally likely outcomes of those coin flips, 

136
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:22,486
but one and only one of them is going to place p1, p2, 

137
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:25,580
and p3 on the opposite side of the center as p4.

138
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,403
So one and only one of these eight equally likely 

139
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:32,760
outcomes gives us a tetrahedron that contains the center.

140
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,340
Again, it's kind of subtle how that pops out to us, but isn't that elegant?

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,505
This is a valid solution to the problem, but admittedly 

142
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:46,780
the way I've stated it so far rests on some visual intuition.

143
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,252
If you're curious about how you might write it up in a way that doesn't 

144
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,985
rely on visual intuition, I've left a link in the description to one 

145
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,640
such write-up in the language of linear algebra, if you're curious.

146
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,731
And this is pretty common in math, where having the key insight and 

147
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:03,618
understanding is one thing, but having the relevant background to articulate 

148
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:07,201
that understanding more formally is almost a separate muscle entirely, 

149
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,340
one that undergraduate math students kind of spend most of their time building up.

150
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,861
But the main takeaway here is not the solution itself, 

151
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:18,693
but how you might find that key insight if it was put in front of you and you 

152
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,020
were just left to solve it.

153
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,520
Namely, just keep asking simpler versions of the 

154
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,740
question until you can get some kind of foothold.

155
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,986
And then when you do, if there's any kind of added construct that proves to be useful, 

156
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,540
see if you can reframe the whole question around that new construct.

157
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,464
To close things off here, I've got another probability puzzle, 

158
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,920
one that comes from this video sponsor, brilliant.org.

159
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,400
Suppose you have eight students sitting in a circle taking the Putnam.

160
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,569
It's a hard test, so each student tries to cheat off of his neighbor, 

161
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,060
choosing randomly which neighbor to cheat from.

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,080
Now circle all of the students that don't have somebody cheating off of their test.

163
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,980
What is the expected number of such circled students?

164
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,760
It's an interesting question, right?

165
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,880
Brilliant.org is a site where you can practice your problem 

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,400
solving abilities with questions like this and many, many more.

167
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
And that really is the best way to learn.

168
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,270
You're going to find countless interesting questions curated in a pretty 

169
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,560
thoughtful way so that you really do come away better at problem solving.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,139
If you want more probability, they have a really good course on probability, 

171
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,626
but they've got all sorts of other math and science as well, 

172
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,480
so you're almost certainly going to find something that interests you.

173
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,220
Me?

174
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,600
I've been a fan for a while, and if you go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b, 

175
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,361
it lets them know that you came from here, and the first 256 of you to visit that 

176
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:40,484
link can get 20% off their premium membership, which is the one I use, 

177
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:41,820
if you want to upgrade.

178
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,436
Also if you're just itching to see a solution to this puzzle, 

179
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,837
which by the way uses a certain tactic in probability that's useful in a lot of 

180
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:52,196
other circumstances, I also left a link in the description that just jumps you 

181
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:53,260
straight to the solution.
