00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
This is a video I've been excited to make for a while now. The story here braids together

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,920
prime numbers, complex numbers, and pi in a very pleasing trio. Quite often in modern

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,760
math, especially that which flirts with the Riemann zeta function, these three seemingly

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,440
unrelated objects show up in unison, and I want to give you a little peek at one instance

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,240
where this happens, one of the few that doesn't require too heavy a technical background.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,160
That's not to say this is easy, in fact this is probably one of the most intricate

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,040
videos I've ever done, but the culmination is worth it. What we'll end up with is a

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,400
formula for pi, a certain alternating infinite sum. This formula is actually written on the

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,940
mug I'm drinking coffee from right now as I write this. And a fun but almost certainly

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,320
apocryphal story is that the beauty of this formula is what inspired Leibniz to quit being

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,360
a lawyer and instead pursue math. Whenever you see pi show up in math, there's always

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,720
going to be a circle hiding somewhere, sometimes very sneakily. So the goal here is not just

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,700
to discover this sum, but to really understand the circle hiding behind it. You see, there

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,840
is another way you can prove the same result that you and I are going to spend some meaningful

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,200
time building up to, but with just a few lines of calculus. And this is one of those proofs

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,520
that leaves you thinking, okay, I suppose that's true, but not really getting a sense

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,160
for why, or where the hidden circle is. On the path you and I will take, though, what

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,080
you'll see is that the fundamental truth behind this sum and the circle it hides is

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,680
a certain regularity in the way that prime numbers behave when you put them inside the

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,920
complex numbers. To start the story, imagine yourself with nothing more than a pencil,

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,040
paper, and a desire to find a formula for computing pi. There are countless ways you

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,880
could approach this, but as a broad outline for the plotline, you'll start by asking

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,840
how many lattice points of the plane sit inside a big circle. That will lead to asking about

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,160
how to express numbers as the sum of two squares, which in turn will lead us to factoring integers

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,080
inside the complex plane. From there we'll bring in a special function named chi, which

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,080
will give us a formula for pi that at first seems to involve a crazy complicated pattern

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,960
dependent on the distribution of primes, but a slight shift in perspective will simplify

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,400
it dramatically and expose the ultimate gold nugget. It's a lot, but good math takes

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,920
time and we'll take it step by step. When I say lattice point, what I mean is a

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,180
point AB on the plane where A and B are both integers, a spot where the grid lines cross.

31
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,180
If you draw a circle centered at the origin, let's say with radius 10, how many lattice

32
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,560
points would you guess are inside that circle? Well, there's one lattice point for each

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,680
unit of area, so the answer should be approximately equal to the area of the circle, pi r squared,

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,980
which in this case is pi times 10 squared. And if it was a really big circle, like radius

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,840
1 million, you would expect this to be a much more accurate estimate, in the sense that

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,800
the percent error between the estimate pi r squared and the actual count of lattice

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,680
points should get smaller. What we're going to try to do is find a

38
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,960
second way to answer this same question, how many lattice points are inside the circle,

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,780
because that can lead to another way to express the area of a circle, and hence another way

40
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,920
to express pi. And so you play, and you wonder, and maybe,

41
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,880
especially if you just watched a certain calculus video, you might try looking through every

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,800
possible ring that a lattice point could sit on.

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Now if you think about it, for each one of these lattice points AB, its distance from

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,920
the origin is the square root of a squared plus b squared. And since a and b are both

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,200
integers, a squared plus b squared is also some integer, so you only have to consider

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,880
rings whose radii are the square roots of some whole number. A radius of 0 just gives

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,640
you that single origin point. If you look at the radius 1, that hits 4 lattice points.

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,140
Radius square root of 2, well that also hits 4 lattice points.

49
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,880
Radius square root of 3 doesn't actually hit anything.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,360
Square root of 4 again hits 4 lattice points. A radius square root of 5 actually hits 8

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,400
lattice points. And what we want is a systematic way to count

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
how many lattice points are on a given one of these rings, a given distance from the

53
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,280
origin, and then tally them all up. And if you pause and try this for a moment,

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,640
what you'll find is that the pattern seems really chaotic, just very hard to find order

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,680
under here. And that's a good sign that some very interesting

56
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,900
math is about to come into play. In fact, as you'll see, this pattern is

57
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,160
rooted in the distribution of primes. As an example, let's look at the ring with

58
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,840
radius square root of 25. It hits the point 5,0, since 5 squared plus

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,840
0 squared is 25. It also hits 4,3, since 4 squared plus 3 squared

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,840
gives 25. And likewise it hits 3,4, and also 0,5.

61
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,120
And what's really happening here is that you're counting how many pairs of integers,

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,600
a,b, have the property that a squared plus b squared equals 25.

63
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,880
And looking at this circle, it looks like there's a total of 12 of them.

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,760
As another example, take a look at the ring with radius square root of 11.

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,520
It doesn't hit any lattice points, and that corresponds to the fact that you cannot find

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,520
two integers whose squares add up to 11. Try it.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,320
Many times in math, when you see a question that has to do with the 2d plane, it can be

68
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,560
surprisingly fruitful to just ask what it looks like when you think of this plane as

69
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,540
the set of all complex numbers. So instead of this lattice point here as the

70
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,280
pair of integer coordinates, 3,4, instead think of it as the single complex number,

71
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,800
3 plus 4i. That way, another way to think about the sum

72
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,240
of the squares of its coordinates, 3 squared plus 4 squared, is to multiply this number

73
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,040
by 3 minus 4i. This is called its complex conjugate, it's

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,360
what you get by reflecting over the real axis, replacing i with negative i.

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,320
And this might seem like a strange step if you don't have much of a history with complex

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,820
numbers, but describing this distance as a product can be unexpectedly useful.

77
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,260
It turns our question into a factoring problem, which is ultimately why patterns among prime

78
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,420
numbers will come into play. Algebraically, this relation is straightforward

79
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,760
enough to verify. You get a 3 squared, and then the 3 times minus 4i cancels out with

80
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,760
the 4i times 3, and then you have negative 4i squared, which because i squared is negative

81
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,740
1, becomes plus 4 squared. This is also quite nice to see geometrically,

82
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,740
and if you're a little rusty with how complex multiplication works, I do have another video

83
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,980
that goes more into detail about why complex multiplication looks the way it does.

84
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,620
The way you might think about a case like this is that the number 3 plus 4i has a magnitude

85
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,620
of 5 and some angle off the horizontal, and what it means to multiply it by 3 minus 4i

86
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,400
is to rotate by that same angle in the opposite direction, putting it on the positive real

87
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,660
axis, and then to stretch out by a factor of 5, which in this case lands you on the

88
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,660
output 25, the square of the magnitude. The collection of all these lattice points,

89
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,700
a plus bi, where a and b are integers, has a special name, they're called the Gaussian

90
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,140
integers, named after Martin Sheen. Geometrically, you'll still be asking the

91
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,700
same question, how many of these lattice points, Gaussian integers, are a given distance away

92
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,780
from the origin, like square root of 25? But we'll be phrasing it in a slightly more

93
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,380
algebraic way, how many Gaussian integers have the property that multiplying by their

94
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:19,380
complex conjugate gives you 25? This might seem needlessly complex, but it's

95
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,940
the key to understanding the seemingly random pattern for how many lattice points are a

96
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,000
given distance away from the origin. To see why, we first need to understand how

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers. As a refresher, among ordinary integers, every

98
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:44,100
number can be factored as some unique collection of prime numbers. For example, 2250 can be

99
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,740
factored as 2 times 3 squared times 5 cubed, and there is no other collection of prime

100
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,740
numbers that also multiplies to make 2250. Unless you let negative numbers into the picture,

101
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,680
in which case you could just make some of the primes in this factorization negative.

102
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,480
So really, within the integers, factorization is not perfectly unique, it's almost unique,

103
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,040
with the exception that you can get a different looking product by multiplying some of the

104
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,860
factors by negative 1. The reason I bring that up is that factoring

105
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,820
works very similarly inside the Gaussian integers. Some numbers, like 5, can be factored into

106
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,860
smaller Gaussian integers, which in this case is 2 plus i times 2 minus i. This Gaussian

107
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,580
integer, 2 plus i, cannot be factored into anything smaller, so we call it a Gaussian

108
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:46,580
prime. Again, this factorization is almost unique, but this time not only can you multiply

109
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,660
each one of those factors by negative 1 to get a factorization that looks different,

110
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,460
you can also be extra sneaky and multiply one of these factors by i, and the other one

111
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:06,460
by negative i. This will give you a different way to factor 5 into two distinct Gaussian

112
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,180
primes. But other than the things you can get by multiplying some of these factors by

113
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:19,180
negative 1, or i, or negative i, factorization within the Gaussian integers is unique.

114
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,980
And if you can figure out how ordinary prime numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers,

115
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,900
that will be enough to tell us how any other natural number factors inside these Gaussian

116
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,440
integers. And so here we pull in a crucial and pretty surprising fact. Prime numbers

117
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,440
that are one above a multiple of 4, like 5, or 13, or 17, can always be factored into

118
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,440
exactly two distinct Gaussian primes. This corresponds with the fact that rings with

119
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,040
a radius equal to the square root of one of these prime numbers always hit some lattice

120
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,640
points. In fact, they always hit exactly 8 lattice points, as you'll see in just a

121
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,640
moment. On the other hand, prime numbers that are 3 above a multiple of 4, like 3, or 7,

122
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:12,640
or 11, cannot be factored further inside the Gaussian integers. Not only are they primes

123
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,240
in the normal numbers, but they're also Gaussian primes, unsplittable even when i

124
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,240
is in the picture. This corresponds with the fact that a ring whose radius is the square

125
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,240
root of one of those primes will never hit any lattice points.

126
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:36,240
This pattern right here is the regularity within prime numbers that we're going to

127
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,920
ultimately exploit. In a later video I might explain why on earth this is true, why a prime

128
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,920
number's remainder when divided by 4 has anything to do with whether or not it factors

129
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,960
inside the Gaussian integers, or said differently, whether or not it can be expressed as the

130
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,120
sum of two squares. But here, and now, we'll just have to take it as a given. The prime

131
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,680
number 2, by the way, is a little special, because it does factor, you can write it as

132
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,520
1 plus i times 1 minus i, but these two Gaussian primes are a 90 degree rotation away from

133
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,720
each other, so you can multiply one of them by i to get the other. And that fact is going

134
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,720
to make us want to treat the prime number 2 a little bit differently for where all of

135
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,920
this stuff is going, so just keep that in the back of your mind.

136
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,280
Remember, our goal here is to count how many lattice points are a given distance away from

137
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,440
the origin, and doing this systematically for all distances square root of n can lead

138
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,280
us to a formula for pi. And counting the number of lattice points with a given magnitude,

139
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,040
like square root of 25, is the same as asking how many Gaussian integers have the special

140
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,080
property that multiplying them by their complex conjugate gives you 25.

141
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,040
So here's the recipe for finding all Gaussian integers that have this property.

142
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,880
Step 1, factor 25, which inside the ordinary integers looks like 5 squared, but since 5

143
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,040
factors even further, as 2 plus i times 2 minus i, 25 breaks down as these four Gaussian

144
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,760
primes. Step 2, organize these into two different

145
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,440
columns, with conjugate pairs sitting right next to each other.

146
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Once you do that, multiply what's in each column, and you'll come out with two different

147
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,700
Gaussian integers on the bottom. Because everything on the right is a conjugate

148
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,720
with everything on the left, what comes out is a complex conjugate pair which multiplies

149
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,680
to 25. Picking an arbitrary standard, let's say

150
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,080
that the product from the left column is the output of our recipe.

151
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,720
Notice, there are three choices for how you can divvy up the primes that can affect this

152
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,040
output. Pictured here, both copies of 2 plus i are

153
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,500
in the left column, and that gives us the product 3 plus 4i.

154
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,360
You could also have chosen to have only one copy of 2 plus i in the left column, in which

155
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,920
case the product would be 5. Or you could have both copies of 2 plus i in

156
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,200
the right column, in which case the output of our recipe would have been 3 minus 4i.

157
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,500
And those three possible outputs are all different lattice points on a circle with radius square

158
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,720
root of 25. But why does this recipe not yet capture all

159
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,120
12 of the lattice points? Remember how I mentioned that a factorization

160
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,000
into Gaussian primes can look different if you multiply some of them by i, or –1, or

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,880
–i? In this case, you could write the factorization

162
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,740
of 25 differently, maybe splitting up one of those 5s as –1 plus 2i times –1 minus

163
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,560
2i. And if you do that, running through the same

164
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,080
recipe, it can affect the result, you'll get a different product out of that left column.

165
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,960
The only effect this will have is to multiply the total output by i, or –1, or –i.

166
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,920
So as a final step for our recipe, let's say you have to make one of four choices.

167
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Take that product from the left column, and choose to multiply it by 1, i, –1, or –i,

168
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,000
corresponding to rotations that are some multiple of 90 degrees.

169
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
That will account for all 12 different ways of constructing a Gaussian integer whose product

170
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,440
with its own conjugate is 25. This process is a little complicated, so I

171
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,000
think the best way to get a feel for it is to try it out with more examples.

172
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,720
Let's say instead we were looking at 125, which is 5 cubed.

173
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,920
In that case, we would have four different choices for how to divvy up the prime conjugate

174
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,800
pairs into these two columns. You can either have zero copies of 2 plus i

175
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:58,320
in the left column, one copy in there, two copies in there, or all three of them in the

176
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,880
left column. Those four choices, multiplied by the final

177
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,640
four choices of multiplying the product from the left column by 1, i, –1, or –i, would

178
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,120
suggest that there are a total of 16 lattice points a distance square root of 125 away

179
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,920
from the origin. Indeed, if you draw that circle out and count,

180
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,100
what you'll find is that it hits exactly 16 lattice points.

181
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,240
But what if you introduce a factor like 3, which doesn't break down as the product

182
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,060
of two conjugate Gaussian primes? Well that really mucks up the whole system.

183
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,200
When you're divvying up the primes between the two columns, there's no way you can

184
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,240
split up this 3. No matter where you put it, it leaves the

185
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,900
columns imbalanced. And what that means is that when you take

186
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,680
the product of all the numbers in each column, you're not going to end up with a conjugate

187
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,160
pair. So for a number like this, 3 times 5 cubed,

188
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,280
which is 375, there's actually no lattice point you'll hit, no Gaussian integer whose

189
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,280
product with its own conjugate gives you 375. However, if you introduce a second factor

190
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,800
of 3, then you have an option. You can throw one 3 in the left column, and

191
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,680
the other 3 in the right column. Since 3 is its own complex conjugate, this

192
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,160
leaves things balanced, in the sense that the products of the left and right columns

193
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:32,160
will indeed be a complex conjugate pair. But it doesn't add any new options. There's

194
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,920
still going to be a total of 4 choices for how to divvy up those factors of 5, multiplied

195
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
by the final 4 choices of multiplying by 1, i, negative 1, or negative i.

196
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,560
So just like the square root of 125 circle, this guy is also going to end up hitting exactly

197
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,120
16 lattice points. Let's just sum up where we are.

198
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,760
When you're counting up how many lattice points lie on a circle with a radius square

199
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,760
root of n, the first step is to factor n. And for prime numbers like 5, or 13, or 17,

200
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,920
which factor further into a complex conjugate pair of Gaussian primes, the number of choices

201
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,920
they give you will always be one more than the exponent that shows up with that factor.

202
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,220
On the other hand, for prime factors like 3, or 7, or 11, which are already Gaussian

203
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,360
primes and cannot be split, if they show up with an even power, you have one and only

204
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,720
one choice with what to do with them. But if it's an odd exponent, you're screwed,

205
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,960
and you have zero choices. And always, no matter what, you have those final 4 choices

206
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,280
at the end.

207
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,360
By the way, I do think this process right here is the most complicated part of the video.

208
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,840
It took me a couple times to think through that yes, this is a valid way to count lattice

209
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,880
points, so don't be shy if you want to pause and scribble things down to get a feel for

210
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,960
it.

211
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,320
The one last thing to mention about this recipe is how factors of 2 affect the count. If your

212
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,320
number is even, then that factor of 2 breaks down as 1 plus i times 1 minus i, so you can

213
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,300
divvy up that complex conjugate pair between the two columns. At first, it might look like

214
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,520
this doubles your options, depending on how you choose to place those two Gaussian primes

215
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,040
between the columns. However, since multiplying one of these guys by i gives you the other

216
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,080
one, when you swap them between the columns, the effect that has on the output from the

217
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,000
left column is to just multiply it by i, or by negative i. So that's actually redundant

218
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,520
with the final step, where we take the product of this left column and choose to multiply

219
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,880
it by either 1, i, negative 1, or negative i. What this means is that a factor of 2,

220
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,960
or any power of 2, doesn't actually change the count at all. It doesn't hurt, but it

221
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,320
doesn't help. For example, a circle with radius square root of 5 hits 8 lattice points,

222
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,220
and if you grow that radius to square root of 10, you also hit 8 lattice points, and

223
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,960
square root of 20 also hits 8 lattice points, as does square root of 40. Factors of 2 just

224
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,600
don't make a difference. Now what's about to happen is number theory

225
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,780
at its best. We have this complicated recipe telling us how many lattice points sit on

226
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,620
a circle with radius square root of n, and it depends on the prime factorization of n.

227
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,660
To turn this into something simpler, something we can actually deal with, we're going to

228
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:38,100
exploit the regularity of primes that those which are 1 above a multiple of 4 split into

229
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,420
distinct Gaussian prime factors, while those that are 3 above a multiple of 4 cannot be

230
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,820
split. To do this, let's introduce a simple function,

231
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,680
one which I'll label with the Greek letter chi. For inputs that are 1 above a multiple

232
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:59,360
of 4, the output of chi is 1. If it takes in an input 3 above a multiple of 4, the output

233
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:09,760
of chi is negative 1. And then on all even numbers, it gives 0.

234
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,880
So if you evaluate chi on the natural numbers, it gives this very nice cyclic pattern, 1,

235
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:23,840
0, negative 1, 0, and then repeat indefinitely. And this cyclic function chi has a very special

236
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,120
property, it's what's called a multiplicative function. If you evaluate it on two different

237
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,200
numbers and multiply the results, like chi of 3 times chi of 5, it's the same as if you

238
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,240
evaluate chi on the product of those two numbers, in this case chi of 15. Likewise, chi of 5

239
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,160
times chi of 5 is equal to chi of 25. And no matter what two natural numbers you put

240
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,320
in there, this property will hold. Go ahead, try it if you want.

241
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,720
So for our central question of counting lattice points in this way that involves factoring

242
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,360
a number, what I'm going to do is write down the number of choices we have but using

243
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,440
chi in what at first seems like a much more complicated way, but this has the benefit

244
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,400
of treating all prime factors equally. For each prime power, like 5 cubed, what you

245
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,800
write down is chi of 1 plus chi of 5 plus chi of 5 squared plus chi of 5 cubed. You

246
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,840
add up the value of chi on all the powers of this prime up to the one that shows up

247
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,400
inside the factorization. In this case, since 5 is 1 above a multiple of 4, all of these

248
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,640
are just 1, so this sum comes out to be 4, which reflects the fact that a factor of 5

249
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,920
cubed gives you 4 options for how to divvy up the two Gaussian prime factors between

250
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:50,680
the columns. For a factor like 3 to the 4th, what you write down looks totally similar,

251
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,400
chi of 1 plus chi of 3 on and on up to chi of 3 to the 4th. But in this case, since chi

252
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:04,840
of 3 is negative 1, this sum oscillates, 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 plus 1. If it's

253
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,600
an even power, like 4 in this case, the sum comes out to be 1, which encapsulates the

254
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,320
fact that there is only one choice for what to do with those unsplittable 3's. But if

255
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,800
it's an odd power, that sum comes out to be 0, indicating that you're screwed, you

256
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,440
can't place that unsplittable 3. When you do this for a power of 2, what it looks like

257
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,520
is 1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 on and on, since chi is always 0 on even numbers. And this

258
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,800
reflects the fact that a factor of 2 doesn't help and it doesn't hurt, you always have

259
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,200
just one option for what to do with it. And as always, we keep a 4 in front to indicate

260
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,320
that final choice of multiplying by 1, i, negative 1, or negative i. We're getting

261
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,440
close to the culmination now, things are starting to look organized, so pause and ponder,

262
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,600
make sure everything feels good up to this point.

263
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,900
Take the number 45 as an example. This guy factors as 3 squared times 5, so the expression

264
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,360
for the total number of lattice points is 4 times chi of 1 plus chi of 3 plus chi of

265
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,620
3 squared times chi of 1 plus chi of 5. You can think about this as 4 times the one choice

266
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,700
for what to do with the 3's times 2 choices for how to divvy up the Gaussian prime factors

267
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,780
of 5. It might seem like expanding out this sum is really complicated, because it involves

268
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:33,620
all possible combinations of these prime factors, and it kind of is. However, because chi is

269
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,380
multiplicative, each one of those combinations corresponds to a divisor of 45. In this case

270
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:48,100
what we get is 4 times chi of 1 plus chi of 3 plus chi of 5 plus chi of 9 plus chi

271
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,640
of 15 plus chi of 45. What you'll notice is that this covers every number that divides

272
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,020
evenly into 45, once and only once. And it works like this for any number, there's

273
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,740
nothing special about 45.

274
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,280
And that to me is pretty interesting, and I think wholly unexpected. This question of

275
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,320
counting the number of lattice points a distance square root of n away from the origin involves

276
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,320
adding up the value of this relatively simple function over all the divisors of n.

277
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,600
To bring it all together, remember why we're doing this. The total number of lattice points

278
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,020
inside a big circle with radius r should be about pi times r squared. But on the other

279
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,080
hand we can count those same lattice points by looking through all the numbers n between

280
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,800
0 and r squared, and counting how many lattice points are a distance square root of n from

281
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,240
the origin. Let's ignore that origin dot with radius 0, it doesn't follow the pattern

282
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,680
of the rest, and one little dot isn't going to make a difference as we let r grow towards

283
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,480
infinity.

284
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,160
From all this Gaussian integer and factoring and chi function stuff we've been doing,

285
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,920
the answer for each n looks like adding up the value of chi on every divisor of n, and

286
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,280
multiplying by 4. And for now let's just take that 4 and put it in the corner, and

287
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,800
remember to bring it back later.

288
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,800
At first, adding up the values for each one of these rows seems super random, right? I

289
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,100
mean numbers with a lot of factors have a lot of divisors, whereas prime numbers will

290
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,200
always only have two divisors, so it initially seems like you would have to have perfect

291
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,220
knowledge of the distribution of primes to get anything useful out of this.

292
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,260
But if instead you organize these into columns, the puzzle starts to fit together. How many

293
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:48,340
numbers between 1 and r2 have 1 as a divisor? All of them. So our sum should include r2

294
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,300
times chi of 1. How many of them have 2 as a divisor? About half of them. So that would

295
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,860
account for r2 over 2 times chi of 2. About a third of these rows have chi of 3, so we

296
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,060
can put in r2 divided by 3 times chi of 3. Keep in mind we're being approximate, since

297
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,820
r2 might not perfectly divide 2 or 3, but as r grows towards infinity, this approximation

298
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,380
will get better. And when you keep going like this, you get a pretty organized expression

299
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:27,020
for the total number of lattice points. And if you factor out that r2 and bring back the

300
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,060
4 that needs to be multiplied in, what it means is that the total number of lattice

301
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:39,620
points inside this big circle is approximately 4 times r2 times this sum. And because chi

302
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:46,140
is 0 on every even number, and it oscillates between 1 and negative 1 for odd numbers,

303
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:53,180
this sum looks like 1 minus 1 third plus a fifth minus 1 seventh and so on. And this

304
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,100
is exactly what we wanted! What we have here is an alternate expression for the total number

305
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,140
of lattice points inside a big circle, which we know should be around pi times r2. And

306
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,340
the bigger r is, the more accurate both of these estimates are, so the percent error

307
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,980
between the left hand side and the right hand side can get arbitrarily small. So divide

308
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,580
out by that r2, and this gives us an infinite sum that should converge to pi. And keep in

309
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,460
mind, I just think this is really cool, the reason this sum came out to be so simple,

310
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,220
and requiring relatively low information to describe, ultimately stems from the regular

311
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,540
pattern in how prime numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers.

312
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,100
If you're curious, there are two main branches of number theory, algebraic number theory

313
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:48,520
and analytic number theory. Very loosely speaking, the former deals with new number systems,

314
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,820
things like these Gaussian integers that you and I looked at, and a lot more, and the latter

315
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,620
deals with things like the Riemann zeta function, or its cousins called L-functions, which involve

316
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,700
multiplicative functions like this central character chi from our story. And the path

317
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,460
we just walked is a little glimpse at where those two fields intersect. And both of these

318
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,060
are pretty heavy duty fields with a lot of active research and unsolved problems. So

319
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,220
if all of this feels like something that takes time to mentally digest, like there's more

320
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,660
patterns to be uncovered and understood, it's because it is, and there are.
