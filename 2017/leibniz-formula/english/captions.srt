00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,080
This is a video I've been excited to make for a while now.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,401
The story here braids together prime numbers, complex numbers, 

3
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,360
and pi in a very pleasing trio.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,592
Quite often in modern math, especially that which flirts with the Riemann zeta function, 

5
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:21,571
these three seemingly unrelated objects show up in unison, 

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:25,256
and I want to give you a little peek at one instance where this happens, 

7
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:28,740
one of the few that doesn't require too heavy a technical background.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,985
That's not to say this is easy, in fact this is probably one of the 

9
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:36,820
most intricate videos I've ever done, but the culmination is worth it.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,720
What we'll end up with is a formula for pi, a certain alternating infinite sum.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,015
This formula is actually written on the mug I'm drinking coffee from right now as 

12
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:51,620
I write this, and a fun but almost certainly apocryphal story is that the beauty of 

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,280
this formula is what inspired Leibniz to quit being a lawyer and instead pursue math.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,629
Whenever you see pi show up in math, there's always going 

15
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,040
to be a circle hiding somewhere, sometimes very sneakily.

16
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,402
So the goal here is not just to discover this sum, 

17
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:10,460
but to really understand the circle hiding behind it.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,132
You see, there is another way you can prove the same result that you and I are going 

19
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:18,900
to spend some meaningful time building up to, but with just a few lines of calculus.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,051
And this is one of those proofs that leaves you thinking, okay, I suppose that's true, 

21
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:29,260
but not really getting a sense for why, or where the hidden circle is.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,305
On the path you and I will take, though, what you'll see is that the fundamental 

23
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:38,588
truth behind this sum and the circle it hides is a certain regularity in the 

24
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:42,760
way that prime numbers behave when you put them inside the complex numbers.

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,403
To start the story, imagine yourself with nothing more than a pencil, 

26
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:50,560
some paper, and a desire to find a formula for computing pi.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,268
There are countless ways you could approach this, 

28
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:58,965
but as a broad outline for the plotline, you'll start by asking how many lattice points 

29
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,940
of the plane sit inside a big circle.

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,909
That will lead to asking about how to express numbers as the sum of two squares, 

31
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,560
which in turn will lead us to factoring integers inside the complex plane.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,656
From there we'll bring in a special function called chi, 

33
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:20,150
which will give us a formula for pi that at first seems to involve a crazy 

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,806
complicated pattern dependent on the distribution of primes, 

35
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:28,301
but a slight shift in perspective will simplify it dramatically and expose 

36
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:29,800
the ultimate gold nugget.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,420
It's a lot, but good math takes time, and we'll take it step by step.

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,585
When I say lattice point, what I mean is a point AB on the plane 

39
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:43,880
where A and B are both integers, a spot where the grid lines cross.

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,288
If you draw a circle centered at the origin, let's say with radius 10, 

41
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:52,200
how many lattice points would you guess are inside that circle?

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,910
Well, there's one lattice point for each unit of area, 

43
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,287
so the answer should be approximately equal to the area of the circle, 

44
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:04,740
pi r squared, which in this case is pi times 10 squared.

45
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,546
And if it was a really big circle, like radius 1 million, 

46
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:11,604
you would expect this to be a much more accurate estimate, 

47
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:15,648
in the sense that the percent error between the estimate pi r squared and the 

48
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:18,240
actual count of lattice points should get smaller.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,547
What we're going to try to do is find a second way to answer this same question, 

50
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,070
how many lattice points are inside the circle, 

51
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,827
because that can lead to another way to express the area of a circle, 

52
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,760
and hence another way to express pi.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,692
And so you play, and you wonder, and maybe, especially if you 

54
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:40,167
just watched a certain calculus video, you might try looking 

55
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:43,700
through every possible ring that a lattice point could sit on.

56
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,093
If you think about it, for each one of these lattice points AB, 

57
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:51,980
its distance from the origin is the square root of a squared plus b squared.

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,827
And since a and b are both integers, a squared plus b squared is also some integer, 

59
00:03:57,827 --> 00:04:03,260
so you only have to consider rings whose radii are the square roots of some whole number.

60
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,360
A radius of 0 just gives you that single origin point.

61
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,640
If you look at the radius 1, that hits 4 different lattice points.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,980
Radius square root of 2, well that also hits 4 lattice points.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,180
A radius square root of 3 doesn't actually hit anything.

64
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,180
Square root of 4 again hits 4 lattice points.

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,140
A radius square root of 5 actually hits 8 lattice points.

66
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,019
And what we want is a systematic way to count how many lattice points are on a 

67
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:36,960
given one of these rings, a given distance from the origin, and tally them all up.

68
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,338
And if you pause and try this for a moment, what you'll find is that 

69
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:45,220
the pattern seems really chaotic, just very hard to find order under here.

70
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,260
And that's a good sign that some very interesting math is about to come into play.

71
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,980
In fact, as you'll see, this pattern is rooted in the distribution of primes.

72
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,880
As an example, let's look at the ring with radius square root of 25.

73
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,180
It hits the point 5,0, since 5 squared plus 0 squared is 25.

74
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,740
It also hits 4,3, since 4 squared plus 3 squared gives 25.

75
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,580
And likewise it hits 3,4, and also 0,5.

76
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,725
And what's really happening here is that you're counting how many pairs of integers, 

77
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:27,480
a,b, have the property that a squared plus b squared equals 25.

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,000
And looking at this circle, it looks like there's a total of 12 of them.

79
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,980
As another example, take a look at the ring with radius square root of 11.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
It doesn't hit any lattice points.

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,754
And that corresponds to the fact that you cannot 

82
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:44,560
find two integers whose squares add up to 11.

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,820
Try it.

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,648
Now, many times in math, when you see a question that has to do with the 2D plane, 

85
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:56,259
it can be surprisingly fruitful to just ask what it looks like when 

86
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,340
you think of this plane as the set of all complex numbers.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,514
So instead of thinking of this lattice point here as the pair of integer coordinates, 

88
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:09,380
3,4, instead think of it as the single complex number, 3 plus 4i.

89
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,724
That way, another way to think about the sum of the squares of its coordinates, 

90
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:20,000
3 squared plus 4 squared, is to multiply this number by 3 minus 4i.

91
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,480
This is called its complex conjugate.

92
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,300
It's what you get by reflecting over the real axis, replacing i with negative i.

93
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,365
And this might seem like a strange step if you 

94
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:32,520
don't have much of a history with complex numbers.

95
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,060
But describing this distance as a product can be unexpectedly useful.

96
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,034
It turns our question into a factoring problem, 

97
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:43,840
which is ultimately why patterns among prime numbers are going to come into play.

98
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,280
Algebraically, this relation is straightforward enough to verify.

99
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,180
You get a 3 squared, and then the 3 times minus 4i cancels out with the 4i times 3.

100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,279
And then you have negative 4i squared, which, because i squared is negative 1, 

101
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,840
becomes plus 4 squared.

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
This is also quite nice to see geometrically.

103
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,900
And if you're a little rusty with how complex multiplication works, 

104
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,294
I do have another video that goes more into detail about why complex multiplication looks 

105
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:15,320
the way that it does.

106
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,631
The way you might think about a case like this is that the number 

107
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:23,600
3 plus 4i has a magnitude of 5 and some angle off of the horizontal.

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,726
And what it means to multiply it by 3 minus 4i is to rotate by that same angle in the 

109
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:33,197
opposite direction, putting it on the positive real axis, 

110
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:38,524
and then to stretch out by a factor of 5, which in this case lands you on the output 25, 

111
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,200
the square of the magnitude.

112
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,125
The collection of all of these lattice points, 

113
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,860
a plus bi, where a and b are integers, has a special name.

114
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,720
They're called the Gaussian integers, named after Martin Sheen.

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,820
Geometrically, you'll still be asking the same question.

116
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,341
How many of these lattice points, Gaussian integers, 

117
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,980
are a given distance away from the origin, like square root of 25?

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,760
But we'll be phrasing it in a slightly more algebraic way.

119
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,210
How many Gaussian integers have the property that 

120
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,800
multiplying by their complex conjugate gives you 25?

121
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,053
This might seem needlessly complex, but it's the key to understanding the seemingly 

122
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:25,620
random pattern for how many lattice points are a given distance away from the origin.

123
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,220
To see why, we first need to understand how numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers.

124
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,784
As a refresher, among ordinary integers, every number 

125
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,679
can be factored as some unique collection of prime numbers.

126
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:48,320
For example, 2250 can be factored as 2 times 3 squared times 5 cubed.

127
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,600
And there is no other collection of prime numbers that also multiplies to make 2250.

128
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,312
Unless you let negative numbers into the picture, 

129
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:02,600
in which case you could just make some of the primes in this factorization negative.

130
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,820
So really, within the integers, factorization is not perfectly unique.

131
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,301
It's almost unique, with the exception that you can get a different 

132
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,400
looking product by multiplying some of the factors by negative 1.

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,579
The reason I bring that up is that factoring works 

134
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,840
very similarly inside the Gaussian integers.

135
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,529
Some numbers, like 5, can be factored into smaller Gaussian integers, 

136
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,880
which in this case is 2 plus i times 2 minus i.

137
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,025
This Gaussian integer here, 2 plus i, cannot be factored into anything smaller, 

138
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,020
so we call it a Gaussian prime.

139
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,946
Again, this factorization is almost unique, but this time not only 

140
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:50,739
can you multiply each one of those factors by negative 1 to get a 

141
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:55,750
factorization that looks different, you can also be extra sneaky and 

142
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,980
multiply one of these factors by i and then the other one by negative i.

143
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,440
This will give you a different way to factor 5 into two distinct Gaussian primes.

144
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,341
But other than the things that you can get by multiplying some of these factors by 

145
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:18,440
negative 1, or i, or negative i, factorization within the Gaussian integers is unique.

146
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,067
And if you can figure out how ordinary prime numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers, 

147
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:28,256
that'll be enough to tell us how any other natural number 

148
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:30,400
factors inside these Gaussian integers.

149
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,040
And so here, we pull in a crucial and pretty surprising fact.

150
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,521
Prime numbers that are 1 above a multiple of 4, like 5, or 13, or 17, 

151
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:47,560
these guys can always be factored into exactly two distinct Gaussian primes.

152
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,310
This corresponds with the fact that rings with a radius equal to the 

153
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,960
square root of one of these prime numbers always hit some lattice points.

154
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,440
In fact, they always hit exactly 8 lattice points, as you'll see in just a moment.

155
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,394
On the other hand, prime numbers that are 3 above a multiple of 4, like 3, 

156
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:13,680
or 7, or 11, these guys cannot be factored further inside the Gaussian integers.

157
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,180
Not only are they primes in the normal numbers, 

158
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,320
but they're also Gaussian primes, unsplittable even when i is in the picture.

159
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,540
And this corresponds with the fact that a ring whose radius is the 

160
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,980
square root of one of those primes will never hit any lattice points.

161
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,030
And this pattern right here is the regularity within 

162
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,880
prime numbers that we're going to ultimately exploit.

163
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,273
And in a later video, I might explain why on earth this is true, 

164
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:47,054
why a prime number's remainder when divided by 4 has anything to do 

165
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:50,667
with whether or not it factors inside the Gaussian integers, or, 

166
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:55,060
said differently, whether or not it can be expressed as the sum of two squares.

167
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,580
But here, and now, we'll just have to take it as a given.

168
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,542
The prime number 2, by the way, is a little special, because it does factor, 

169
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:09,910
you can write it as 1 plus i times 1 minus i, but these two Gaussian primes are a 90 

170
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,088
degree rotation away from each other, so you can multiply one of them by i to get 

171
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:15,720
the other.

172
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,194
And that fact is going to make us want to treat the prime number 2 a little bit 

173
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:22,466
differently for where all of this stuff is going, 

174
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,420
so just keep that in the back of your mind.

175
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,476
Remember, our goal here is to count how many lattice points are a 

176
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:34,148
given distance away from the origin, and doing this systematically 

177
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:37,820
for all distances square root of n can lead us to a formula for pi.

178
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,914
And counting the number of lattice points with a given magnitude, 

179
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:47,333
like square root of 25, is the same as asking how many Gaussian integers 

180
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:52,660
have the special property that multiplying them by their complex conjugate gives you 25.

181
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So here's the recipe for finding all Gaussian integers that have this property.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,030
Step 1, factor 25, which inside the ordinary integers looks like 5 squared, 

183
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,029
but since 5 factors even further, as 2 plus i times 2 minus i, 

184
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:12,600
25 breaks down as these four Gaussian primes.

185
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,414
Step 2, organize these into two different columns, 

186
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,500
with conjugate pairs sitting right next to each other.

187
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,929
And once you do that, multiply what's in each column, 

188
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:26,440
and you'll come out with two different Gaussian integers on the bottom.

189
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,553
And because everything on the right is a conjugate with everything on the left, 

190
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:36,540
what comes out is going to be a complex conjugate pair which multiplies to 25.

191
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,368
Picking an arbitrary standard, let's say that the 

192
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:43,140
product from that left column is the output of our recipe.

193
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,415
Now notice, there are three choices for how you 

194
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:50,380
can divvy up the primes that can affect this output.

195
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,224
Pictured right here, both copies of 2 plus i are in the left column, 

196
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:57,500
and that gives us the product 3 plus 4i.

197
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,925
You could also have chosen to have only one copy of 2 plus i in this left column, 

198
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,940
in which case the product would be 5.

199
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,422
Or you could have both copies of 2 plus i in that right column, 

200
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:13,240
in which case the output of our recipe would have been 3 minus 4i.

201
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,923
And those three possible outputs are all different 

202
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:22,280
lattice points on a circle with radius square root of 25.

203
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,120
But why does this recipe not yet capture all 12 of the lattice points?

204
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,012
Remember how I mentioned that a factorization into Gaussian primes can 

205
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:38,060
look different if you multiply some of them by i or negative 1, negative i?

206
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,978
In this case, you could write the factorization of 25 differently, 

207
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:48,240
maybe splitting up one of those fives as negative 1 plus 2i times negative 1 minus 2i.

208
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,500
And if you do that, running through the same recipe, it can affect the result.

209
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,980
You'll get a different product out of that left column.

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,369
But the only effect that this is going to have is to multiply that total output by i, 

211
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:03,180
or negative 1, or negative i.

212
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,140
So as a final step for our recipe, let's say that you have to make one of four choices.

213
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,304
Take that product from the left column and choose to multiply it by 1, i, negative 1, 

214
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:19,360
or negative i, corresponding to rotations that are some multiple of 90 degrees.

215
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,071
That will account for all 12 different ways of constructing 

216
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,720
a Gaussian integer whose product with its own conjugate is 25.

217
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,240
This process is a little complicated, so I think the best way 

218
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,960
to get a feel for it is to just try it out with more examples.

219
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Let's say instead we were looking at 125, which is 5 cubed.

220
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,250
In that case, we would have four different choices for how 

221
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,860
to divvy up the prime conjugate pairs into these two columns.

222
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,110
You can either have zero copies of 2 plus i in the left column, 

223
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,920
one copy in there, two copies in there, or all three of them in that left column.

224
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,560
Those four choices multiplied by the final four choices of multiplying the product from 

225
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,651
the left column by 1, or by i, or negative 1, or negative i, 

226
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:15,283
would suggest that there are a total of 16 lattice points a distance square root of 

227
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,960
125 away from the origin.

228
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,874
And indeed, if you draw that circle out and count, 

229
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:25,200
what you'll find is that it hits exactly 16 lattice points.

230
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,041
But what if you introduce a factor like 3, which doesn't 

231
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,520
break down as the product of two conjugate Gaussian primes?

232
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,440
Well that really mucks up the whole system.

233
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,928
When you're divvying up the primes between the two columns, 

234
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:42,120
there's no way that you can split up this 3.

235
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,620
No matter where you put it, it leaves the columns imbalanced.

236
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,558
And what that means is that when you take the product of all of the 

237
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:53,100
numbers in each column, you're not going to end up with a conjugate pair.

238
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,752
So for a number like this, 3 times 5 cubed, which is 375, 

239
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:01,280
there's actually no lattice point that you'll hit.

240
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,680
No Gaussian integer whose product with its own conjugate gives you 375.

241
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,420
However, if you introduce a second factor of 3, then you have an option.

242
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,200
You can throw one 3 in the left column, and the other 3 in the right column.

243
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,388
Since 3 is its own complex conjugate, this leaves things balanced, 

244
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:26,702
in the sense that the product of the left and right columns will indeed be a complex 

245
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:27,640
conjugate pair.

246
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,520
But it doesn't add any new options.

247
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,752
There's still going to be a total of 4 choices for how to divvy up those factors of 5, 

248
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:41,400
multiplied by the final 4 choices of multiplying by 1, i, negative 1, or negative i.

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,894
So just like the square root of 125 circle, this guy is 

250
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:49,720
also going to end up hitting exactly 16 lattice points.

251
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,620
Let's just sum up where we are.

252
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,382
When you're counting up how many lattice points lie on a circle 

253
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:59,640
with a radius square root of n, the first step is to factor n.

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,435
And for prime numbers like 5, or 13, or 17, which factor further into a 

255
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:10,056
complex conjugate pair of Gaussian primes, the number of choices they give 

256
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:14,800
you will always be one more than the exponent that shows up with that factor.

257
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,462
On the other hand, for prime factors like 3, or 7, or 11, 

258
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:23,556
which are already Gaussian primes and cannot be split, 

259
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:27,437
if they show up with an even power, you have one and only one choice 

260
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,900
with what to do with them.

261
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,240
But if it's an odd exponent, you're screwed, and you just have zero choices.

262
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,640
And always, no matter what, you have those final 4 choices at the end.

263
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,280
By the way, I do think that this process right 

264
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,700
here is the most complicated part of the video.

265
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,996
It took me a couple times to think through that, yes, 

266
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,953
this is a valid way to count lattice points, so don't be shy 

267
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:54,200
if you want to pause and scribble things down to get a feel for it.

268
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,080
The one last thing to mention about this recipe is how factors of 2 affect the count.

269
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,680
If your number is even, then that factor of 2 breaks down as 1 plus i times 1 minus i.

270
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,820
So you can divvy up that complex conjugate pair between the two columns.

271
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,052
And at first, it might look like this doubles your options, 

272
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:20,580
depending on how you choose to place those two Gaussian primes between the columns.

273
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,156
However, since multiplying one of these guys by i gives you the other one, 

274
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:30,665
when you swap them between the columns, the effect that that has on the 

275
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:35,300
output from the left column is to just multiply it by i, or by negative i.

276
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,464
So that's actually redundant with the final step, 

277
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:43,844
where we take the product of this left column and choose to multiply it by either 1, 

278
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,680
i, negative 1, or negative i.

279
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,506
What this means is that a factor of 2, or any power of 2, 

280
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:53,240
doesn't actually change the count at all.

281
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,620
It doesn't hurt, but it doesn't help.

282
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,860
For example, a circle with radius square root of 5 hits 8 lattice points.

283
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,620
And if you grow that radius to square root of 10, then you also hit 8 lattice points.

284
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,160
And square root of 20 also hits 8 lattice points, as does square root of 40.

285
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,080
Factors of 2 just don't make a difference.

286
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,320
Now what's about to happen is number theory at its best.

287
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,513
We have this complicated recipe telling us how many lattice points sit on a circle 

288
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,720
with radius square root of n, and it depends on the prime factorization of n.

289
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,013
To turn this into something simpler, something we can actually deal with, 

290
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:36,016
we're going to exploit the regularity of primes that those which are 

291
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:39,961
1 above a multiple of 4 split into distinct Gaussian prime factors, 

292
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:43,500
while those that are 3 above a multiple of 4 cannot be split.

293
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,530
To do this, let's introduce a simple function, 

294
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,760
one which I'll label with the Greek letter chi.

295
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,820
For inputs that are 1 above a multiple of 4, the output of chi is just 1.

296
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,900
If it takes in an input 3 above a multiple of 4, then the output of chi is negative 1.

297
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,240
And then on all even numbers, it gives 0.

298
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,827
So if you evaluate chi on the natural numbers, it gives this very nice cyclic pattern, 

299
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:19,360
1, 0, negative 1, 0, and then repeat indefinitely.

300
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,160
And this cyclic function chi has a very special property.

301
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,660
It's what's called a multiplicative function.

302
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,940
If you evaluate it on two different numbers and multiply the results, 

303
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,829
like chi of 3 times chi of 5, it's the same as if you evaluate 

304
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,780
chi on the product of those two numbers, in this case chi of 15.

305
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,713
Likewise, chi of 5 times chi of 5 is equal to chi of 25, 

306
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:50,160
and no matter what two natural numbers you put in there, this property will hold.

307
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,880
Go ahead, try it if you want.

308
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,837
So for our central question of counting lattice points in this way that 

309
00:21:56,837 --> 00:22:01,022
involves factoring a number, what I'm going to do is write down the number 

310
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:06,044
of choices we have but using chi in what at first seems like a much more complicated way, 

311
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:09,560
but this has the benefit of treating all prime factors equally.

312
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,029
For each prime power, like 5 cubed, what you write down is chi 

313
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,260
of 1 plus chi of 5 plus chi of 5 squared plus chi of 5 cubed.

314
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,586
You add up the value of chi on all the powers of this 

315
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:26,220
prime up to the one that shows up inside the factorization.

316
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,327
In this case, since 5 is 1 above a multiple of 4, all of these are just 1, 

317
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:37,648
so this sum comes out to be 4, which reflects the fact that a factor of 5 cubed 

318
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:43,167
gives you 4 options for how to divvy up the two Gaussian prime factors between the 

319
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:43,700
columns.

320
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,164
For a factor like 3 to the 4th, what you write down looks totally similar, 

321
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:54,960
chi of 1 plus chi of 3 on and on up to chi of 3 to the 4th.

322
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,862
But in this case, since chi of 3 is negative 1, 

323
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:03,720
this sum oscillates, it goes 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 plus 1.

324
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,400
And if it's an even power, like 4 in this case, 

325
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,187
the total sum comes out to be 1, which encapsulates the fact 

326
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:15,720
that there is only one choice for what to do with those unsplittable 3's.

327
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,037
But if it's an odd power, that sum comes out to 0, 

328
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:22,820
indicating that you're screwed, you can't place that unsplittable 3.

329
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,945
When you do this for a power of 2, what it looks like is 1 plus 

330
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:33,380
0 plus 0 plus 0 on and on, since chi is always 0 on even numbers.

331
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,151
And this reflects the fact that a factor of 2 doesn't help and it doesn't hurt, 

332
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:41,060
you always have just one option for what to do with it.

333
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,410
And as always, we keep a 4 in front to indicate that final choice of multiplying by 1, 

334
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,900
i, negative 1, or negative i.

335
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,700
We're getting close to the culmination now.

336
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,522
Things are starting to look organized, so take a moment, 

337
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:56,440
pause and ponder, make sure everything feels good up to this point.

338
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,460
Take the number 45 as an example.

339
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,285
This guy factors as 3 squared times 5, so the expression for 

340
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:08,362
the total number of lattice points is 4 times chi of 1 plus 

341
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:12,440
chi of 3 plus chi of 3 squared times chi of 1 plus chi of 5.

342
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,237
You can think about this as 4 times the one choice for what to do with the 

343
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:21,260
3's times two choices for how to divvy up the Gaussian prime factors of 5.

344
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,822
It might seem like expanding out this sum is really complicated, 

345
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:29,860
because it involves all possible combinations of these prime factors.

346
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,380
And it kind of is.

347
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,547
However, because chi is multiplicative, each one of 

348
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:38,940
those combinations corresponds to a divisor of 45.

349
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,868
In this case, we get 4 times chi of 1 plus chi of 3 plus 

350
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:50,380
chi of 5 plus chi of 9 plus chi of 15 plus chi of 45.

351
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,868
What you'll notice is that this covers every number that divides evenly into 45, 

352
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:58,160
once and only once.

353
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,480
And it works like this for any number, there's nothing special about 45.

354
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,760
And that to me is pretty interesting, and I think wholly unexpected.

355
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,117
This question of counting the number of lattice points a distance 

356
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:14,628
square root of n away from the origin, involves adding up the 

357
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:18,480
value of this relatively simple function over all the divisors of n.

358
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,720
To bring it all together, remember why we're doing this.

359
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,241
The total number of lattice points inside a big circle 

360
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,040
with radius r should be about pi times r squared.

361
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,910
But on the other hand, we can count those same lattice points by looking 

362
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,773
through all of the numbers n between 0 and r squared, 

363
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:40,280
and counting how many lattice points are a distance square root of n from the origin.

364
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,342
Let's go ahead and just ignore that origin dot with radius 0, 

365
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,812
it doesn't really follow the pattern of the rest, 

366
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:51,060
and one little dot isn't going to make a difference as we let r grow towards infinity.

367
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,846
Now from all of this Gaussian integer and factoring and chi function 

368
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:01,493
stuff that we've been doing, the answer for each n looks like adding 

369
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:06,140
up the value of chi on every divisor of n, and then multiplying by 4.

370
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,974
And for now let's just take that 4 and put it in the corner, 

371
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,600
and remember to bring it back later.

372
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,340
At first, adding up the values for each one of these rows seems super random, right?

373
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,507
I mean, numbers with a lot of factors have a lot of divisors, 

374
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:25,880
whereas prime numbers will always only have two divisors.

375
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,591
So it initially seems like you would have to have perfect knowledge 

376
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:33,140
of the distribution of primes to get anything useful out of this.

377
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,040
But if instead you organize these into columns, the puzzle starts to fit together.

378
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,920
How many numbers between 1 and r squared have 1 as a divisor?

379
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,400
Well, all of them.

380
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,200
So our sum should include r squared times chi of 1.

381
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,320
How many of them have 2 as a divisor?

382
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,320
Well, about half of them.

383
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,520
So that would account for about r squared over 2 times chi of 2.

384
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,120
About a third of these rows have chi of 3, so we 

385
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,120
can put in r squared divided by 3 times chi of 3.

386
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,120
And keep in mind we're being approximate since r squared might not perfectly 

387
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,540
divide 2 or 3, but as r grows towards infinity, this approximation will get better.

388
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,607
And when you keep going like this, you get a pretty 

389
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,200
organized expression for the total number of lattice points.

390
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,919
And if you factor out that r squared and then bring back the 4 that needs 

391
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,126
to be multiplied in, what it means is that the total number of lattice points 

392
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:38,000
inside this big circle is approximately 4 times r squared times this sum.

393
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:45,708
And because chi is 0 on every even number, and it oscillates between 1 and negative 1 for 

394
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:52,600
odd numbers, this sum looks like 1 minus 1 third plus a fifth minus 1 seventh and so on.

395
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,360
And this is exactly what we wanted.

396
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,883
What we have here is an alternate expression for the total number of lattice 

397
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:03,060
points inside a big circle, which we know should be around pi times r squared.

398
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,826
And the bigger r is, the more accurate both of these estimates are, 

399
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:12,327
so the percent error between the left-hand side and the right-hand side can get 

400
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:13,340
arbitrarily small.

401
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,086
So divide out by that r squared, and this gives 

402
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:20,140
us an infinite sum that should converge to pi.

403
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,160
And keep in mind, I just think this is really cool.

404
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,424
The reason that this sum came out to be so simple, 

405
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:29,369
requiring relatively low information to describe, 

406
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:33,139
ultimately stems from the regular pattern and how prime numbers 

407
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,260
factor inside the Gaussian integers.

408
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,496
If you're curious, there are two main branches of number theory, 

409
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:43,600
algebraic number theory and analytic number theory.

410
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,825
Very loosely speaking, the former deals with new number systems, 

411
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:51,860
things like these Gaussian integers that you and I looked at, and a lot more.

412
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,728
And the latter deals with things like the Riemann zeta function, 

413
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:59,176
or its cousins, called L-functions, which involve multiplicative 

414
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:02,200
functions like this central character chi from our story.

415
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,300
And the path that we just walked is a little glimpse at where those two fields intersect.

416
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,046
And both of these are pretty heavy-duty fields 

417
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:12,400
with a lot of active research and unsolved problems.

418
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,058
So if all this feels like something that takes time to mentally digest, 

419
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:21,510
like there's more patterns to be uncovered and understood, it's because it is, 

420
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,300
and there are.
