00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,780
This is a video I've been excited to make for a while now. The story here braids together

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,940
prime numbers, complex numbers, and pi in a very pleasing trio. Quite often in modern

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,720
math, especially that which flirts with the Riemann zeta function, these three seemingly

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,380
unrelated objects show up in unison, and I want to give you a little peek at one instance

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,740
where this happens, one of the few that doesn't require too heavy a technical background.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,100
That's not to say this is easy, in fact this is probably one of the most intricate

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,200
videos I've ever done, but the culmination is worth it. What we'll end up with is a

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,540
formula for pi, a certain alternating infinite sum. This formula is actually written on the

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,000
mug I'm drinking coffee from right now as I write this, and a fun but almost certainly

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,380
apocryphal story is that the beauty of this formula is what inspired Leibniz to quit being

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,280
a lawyer and instead pursue math.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,120
Whenever you see pi show up in math, there's always going to be a circle hiding somewhere,

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,960
sometimes very sneakily. So the goal here is not just to discover this sum, but to really

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,480
understand the circle hiding behind it. You see, there is another way you can prove the

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,600
same result that you and I are going to spend some meaningful time building up to, but with

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,160
just a few lines of calculus. And this is one of those proofs that leaves you thinking,

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,520
okay, I suppose that's true, but not really getting a sense for why, or where the hidden

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,620
circle is. On the path you and I will take, though, what you'll see is that the fundamental

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,360
truth behind this sum and the circle it hides is a certain regularity in the way that prime

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,760
numbers behave when you put them inside the complex numbers.

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,800
To start the story, imagine yourself with nothing more than a pencil, some paper, and

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,500
a desire to find a formula for computing pi. There are countless ways you could approach

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,780
this, but as a broad outline for the plotline, you'll start by asking how many lattice

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,580
points of the plane sit inside a big circle. That will lead to asking about how to express

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,560
numbers as the sum of two squares, which in turn will lead us to factoring integers inside

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,300
the complex plane. From there we'll bring in a special function called chi, which will

27
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,400
give us a formula for pi that at first seems to involve a crazy complicated pattern dependent

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,700
on the distribution of primes, but a slight shift in perspective will simplify it dramatically

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,260
and expose the ultimate gold nugget. It's a lot, but good math takes time, and we'll

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,080
take it step by step. When I say lattice point, what I mean is a

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,880
point AB on the plane where A and B are both integers, a spot where the grid lines cross.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,900
If you draw a circle centered at the origin, let's say with radius 10, how many lattice

33
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,640
points would you guess are inside that circle? Well, there's one lattice point for each

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,120
unit of area, so the answer should be approximately equal to the area of the circle, pi r squared,

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,780
which in this case is pi times 10 squared. And if it was a really big circle, like radius

36
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,880
1 million, you would expect this to be a much more accurate estimate, in the sense that

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,580
the percent error between the estimate pi r squared and the actual count of lattice

38
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,800
points should get smaller. What we're going to try to do is find a

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,320
second way to answer this same question, how many lattice points are inside the circle,

40
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,840
because that can lead to another way to express the area of a circle, and hence another way

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,440
to express pi. And so you play, and you wonder, and maybe,

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,960
especially if you just watched a certain calculus video, you might try looking through every

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,700
possible ring that a lattice point could sit on.

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,400
If you think about it, for each one of these lattice points AB, its distance from the origin

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,980
is the square root of a squared plus b squared. And since a and b are both integers, a squared

46
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,400
plus b squared is also some integer, so you only have to consider rings whose radii are

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,020
the square roots of some whole number. A radius of 0 just gives you that single origin

48
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,620
point. If you look at the radius 1, that hits 4

49
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,980
different lattice points. Radius square root of 2, well that also hits

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,520
4 lattice points. A radius square root of 3 doesn't actually

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,180
hit anything. Square root of 4 again hits 4 lattice points.

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,140
A radius square root of 5 actually hits 8 lattice points.

53
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,440
And what we want is a systematic way to count how many lattice points are on a given one

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,960
of these rings, a given distance from the origin, and tally them all up.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,060
And if you pause and try this for a moment, what you'll find is that the pattern seems

56
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,220
really chaotic, just very hard to find order under here.

57
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,260
And that's a good sign that some very interesting math is about to come into play.

58
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,980
In fact, as you'll see, this pattern is rooted in the distribution of primes.

59
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,880
As an example, let's look at the ring with radius square root of 25.

60
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,180
It hits the point 5,0, since 5 squared plus 0 squared is 25.

61
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,740
It also hits 4,3, since 4 squared plus 3 squared gives 25.

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,580
And likewise it hits 3,4, and also 0,5.

63
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,960
And what's really happening here is that you're counting how many pairs of integers,

64
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,480
a,b, have the property that a squared plus b squared equals 25.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,000
And looking at this circle, it looks like there's a total of 12 of them.

66
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,980
As another example, take a look at the ring with radius square root of 11.

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
It doesn't hit any lattice points.

68
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,560
And that corresponds to the fact that you cannot find two integers whose squares add up to 11.

69
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,820
Try it.

70
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,460
Now, many times in math, when you see a question that has to do with the 2D plane,

71
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,080
it can be surprisingly fruitful to just ask what it looks like

72
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,340
when you think of this plane as the set of all complex numbers.

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,700
So instead of thinking of this lattice point here as the pair of integer coordinates, 3,4,

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,380
instead think of it as the single complex number, 3 plus 4i.

75
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,880
That way, another way to think about the sum of the squares of its coordinates, 3 squared plus 4 squared,

76
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,000
is to multiply this number by 3 minus 4i.

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,480
This is called its complex conjugate.

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,300
It's what you get by reflecting over the real axis, replacing i with negative i.

79
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,520
And this might seem like a strange step if you don't have much of a history with complex numbers.

80
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,060
But describing this distance as a product can be unexpectedly useful.

81
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,960
It turns our question into a factoring problem,

82
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,840
which is ultimately why patterns among prime numbers are going to come into play.

83
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,280
Algebraically, this relation is straightforward enough to verify.

84
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,180
You get a 3 squared, and then the 3 times minus 4i cancels out with the 4i times 3.

85
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,840
And then you have negative 4i squared, which, because i squared is negative 1, becomes plus 4 squared.

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
This is also quite nice to see geometrically.

87
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,340
And if you're a little rusty with how complex multiplication works,

88
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,320
I do have another video that goes more into detail about why complex multiplication looks the way that it does.

89
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,600
The way you might think about a case like this is that the number 3 plus 4i has a magnitude of 5 and some angle off of the horizontal.

90
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,880
And what it means to multiply it by 3 minus 4i is to rotate by that same angle in the opposite direction,

91
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,680
putting it on the positive real axis, and then to stretch out by a factor of 5,

92
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,200
which in this case lands you on the output 25, the square of the magnitude.

93
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,860
The collection of all of these lattice points, a plus bi, where a and b are integers, has a special name.

94
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,720
They're called the Gaussian integers, named after Martin Sheen.

95
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,820
Geometrically, you'll still be asking the same question.

96
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,980
How many of these lattice points, Gaussian integers, are a given distance away from the origin, like square root of 25?

97
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,760
But we'll be phrasing it in a slightly more algebraic way.

98
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,800
How many Gaussian integers have the property that multiplying by their complex conjugate gives you 25?

99
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,160
This might seem needlessly complex, but it's the key to understanding the seemingly random pattern

100
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,620
for how many lattice points are a given distance away from the origin.

101
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,220
To see why, we first need to understand how numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers.

102
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,680
As a refresher, among ordinary integers, every number can be factored as some unique collection of prime numbers.

103
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,320
For example, 2250 can be factored as 2 times 3 squared times 5 cubed.

104
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,600
And there is no other collection of prime numbers that also multiplies to make 2250.

105
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
Unless you let negative numbers into the picture,

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,600
in which case you could just make some of the primes in this factorization negative.

107
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,820
So really, within the integers, factorization is not perfectly unique.

108
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,400
It's almost unique, with the exception that you can get a different looking product by multiplying some of the factors by negative 1.

109
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,840
The reason I bring that up is that factoring works very similarly inside the Gaussian integers.

110
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:31,880
Some numbers, like 5, can be factored into smaller Gaussian integers, which in this case is 2 plus i times 2 minus i.

111
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,020
This Gaussian integer here, 2 plus i, cannot be factored into anything smaller, so we call it a Gaussian prime.

112
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:48,660
Again, this factorization is almost unique, but this time not only can you multiply each one of those factors by negative 1

113
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,180
to get a factorization that looks different,

114
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:00,980
you can also be extra sneaky and multiply one of these factors by i and then the other one by negative i.

115
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,440
This will give you a different way to factor 5 into two distinct Gaussian primes.

116
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,960
But other than the things that you can get by multiplying some of these factors by negative 1, or i, or negative i,

117
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,440
factorization within the Gaussian integers is unique.

118
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,280
And if you can figure out how ordinary prime numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers,

119
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,400
that'll be enough to tell us how any other natural number factors inside these Gaussian integers.

120
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,040
And so here, we pull in a crucial and pretty surprising fact.

121
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,780
Prime numbers that are 1 above a multiple of 4, like 5, or 13, or 17,

122
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,560
these guys can always be factored into exactly two distinct Gaussian primes.

123
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,920
This corresponds with the fact that rings with a radius equal to the square root of one of these prime numbers

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,960
always hit some lattice points.

125
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,440
In fact, they always hit exactly 8 lattice points, as you'll see in just a moment.

126
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,660
On the other hand, prime numbers that are 3 above a multiple of 4, like 3, or 7, or 11,

127
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,680
these guys cannot be factored further inside the Gaussian integers.

128
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,780
Not only are they primes in the normal numbers, but they're also Gaussian primes,

129
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,320
unsplittable even when i is in the picture.

130
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,660
And this corresponds with the fact that a ring whose radius is the square root of one of those primes

131
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,980
will never hit any lattice points.

132
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,880
And this pattern right here is the regularity within prime numbers that we're going to ultimately exploit.

133
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,760
And in a later video, I might explain why on earth this is true,

134
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:50,500
why a prime number's remainder when divided by 4 has anything to do with whether or not it factors inside the Gaussian integers,

135
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,060
or, said differently, whether or not it can be expressed as the sum of two squares.

136
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,580
But here, and now, we'll just have to take it as a given.

137
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,740
The prime number 2, by the way, is a little special, because it does factor,

138
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,320
you can write it as 1 plus i times 1 minus i,

139
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,080
but these two Gaussian primes are a 90 degree rotation away from each other,

140
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,720
so you can multiply one of them by i to get the other.

141
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,720
And that fact is going to make us want to treat the prime number 2 a little bit differently

142
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,420
for where all of this stuff is going, so just keep that in the back of your mind.

143
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,820
Remember, our goal here is to count how many lattice points are a given distance away from the origin,

144
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,820
and doing this systematically for all distances square root of n can lead us to a formula for pi.

145
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,280
And counting the number of lattice points with a given magnitude, like square root of 25,

146
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,520
is the same as asking how many Gaussian integers have the special property

147
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,660
that multiplying them by their complex conjugate gives you 25.

148
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So here's the recipe for finding all Gaussian integers that have this property.

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,400
Step 1, factor 25, which inside the ordinary integers looks like 5 squared,

150
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,920
but since 5 factors even further, as 2 plus i times 2 minus i,

151
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,600
25 breaks down as these four Gaussian primes.

152
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Step 2, organize these into two different columns, with conjugate pairs sitting right next to each other.

153
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
And once you do that, multiply what's in each column,

154
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,440
and you'll come out with two different Gaussian integers on the bottom.

155
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,960
And because everything on the right is a conjugate with everything on the left,

156
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,540
what comes out is going to be a complex conjugate pair which multiplies to 25.

157
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,140
Picking an arbitrary standard, let's say that the product from that left column is the output of our recipe.

158
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,380
Now notice, there are three choices for how you can divvy up the primes that can affect this output.

159
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,900
Pictured right here, both copies of 2 plus i are in the left column,

160
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,500
and that gives us the product 3 plus 4i.

161
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,620
You could also have chosen to have only one copy of 2 plus i in this left column,

162
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,940
in which case the product would be 5.

163
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,740
Or you could have both copies of 2 plus i in that right column,

164
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,240
in which case the output of our recipe would have been 3 minus 4i.

165
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,280
And those three possible outputs are all different lattice points on a circle with radius square root of 25.

166
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,120
But why does this recipe not yet capture all 12 of the lattice points?

167
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,200
Remember how I mentioned that a factorization into Gaussian primes can look different

168
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,060
if you multiply some of them by i or negative 1, negative i?

169
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,060
In this case, you could write the factorization of 25 differently,

170
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,240
maybe splitting up one of those fives as negative 1 plus 2i times negative 1 minus 2i.

171
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,500
And if you do that, running through the same recipe, it can affect the result.

172
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,980
You'll get a different product out of that left column.

173
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,180
But the only effect that this is going to have is to multiply that total output by i, or negative 1, or negative i.

174
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,140
So as a final step for our recipe, let's say that you have to make one of four choices.

175
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,640
Take that product from the left column and choose to multiply it by 1, i, negative 1, or negative i,

176
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,360
corresponding to rotations that are some multiple of 90 degrees.

177
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,720
That will account for all 12 different ways of constructing a Gaussian integer whose product with its own conjugate is 25.

178
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,960
This process is a little complicated, so I think the best way to get a feel for it is to just try it out with more examples.

179
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Let's say instead we were looking at 125, which is 5 cubed.

180
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:47,860
In that case, we would have four different choices for how to divvy up the prime conjugate pairs into these two columns.

181
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:58,920
You can either have zero copies of 2 plus i in the left column, one copy in there, two copies in there, or all three of them in that left column.

182
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:10,060
Those four choices multiplied by the final four choices of multiplying the product from the left column by 1, or by i, or negative 1, or negative i,

183
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,960
would suggest that there are a total of 16 lattice points a distance square root of 125 away from the origin.

184
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,200
And indeed, if you draw that circle out and count, what you'll find is that it hits exactly 16 lattice points.

185
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,520
But what if you introduce a factor like 3, which doesn't break down as the product of two conjugate Gaussian primes?

186
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,440
Well that really mucks up the whole system.

187
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,120
When you're divvying up the primes between the two columns, there's no way that you can split up this 3.

188
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,620
No matter where you put it, it leaves the columns imbalanced.

189
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,100
And what that means is that when you take the product of all of the numbers in each column, you're not going to end up with a conjugate pair.

190
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:01,280
So for a number like this, 3 times 5 cubed, which is 375, there's actually no lattice point that you'll hit.

191
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,680
No Gaussian integer whose product with its own conjugate gives you 375.

192
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,420
However, if you introduce a second factor of 3, then you have an option.

193
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,200
You can throw one 3 in the left column, and the other 3 in the right column.

194
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:27,640
Since 3 is its own complex conjugate, this leaves things balanced, in the sense that the product of the left and right columns will indeed be a complex conjugate pair.

195
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,520
But it doesn't add any new options.

196
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:41,400
There's still going to be a total of 4 choices for how to divvy up those factors of 5, multiplied by the final 4 choices of multiplying by 1, i, negative 1, or negative i.

197
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,720
So just like the square root of 125 circle, this guy is also going to end up hitting exactly 16 lattice points.

198
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,620
Let's just sum up where we are.

199
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,640
When you're counting up how many lattice points lie on a circle with a radius square root of n, the first step is to factor n.

200
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,300
And for prime numbers like 5, or 13, or 17, which factor further into a complex conjugate pair of Gaussian primes,

201
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,800
the number of choices they give you will always be one more than the exponent that shows up with that factor.

202
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,780
On the other hand, for prime factors like 3, or 7, or 11, which are already Gaussian primes and cannot be split,

203
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,900
if they show up with an even power, you have one and only one choice with what to do with them.

204
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,240
But if it's an odd exponent, you're screwed, and you just have zero choices.

205
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,640
And always, no matter what, you have those final 4 choices at the end.

206
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,700
By the way, I do think that this process right here is the most complicated part of the video.

207
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,940
It took me a couple times to think through that, yes, this is a valid way to count lattice points,

208
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,200
so don't be shy if you want to pause and scribble things down to get a feel for it.

209
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,080
The one last thing to mention about this recipe is how factors of 2 affect the count.

210
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,680
If your number is even, then that factor of 2 breaks down as 1 plus i times 1 minus i.

211
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,820
So you can divvy up that complex conjugate pair between the two columns.

212
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,740
And at first, it might look like this doubles your options,

213
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,580
depending on how you choose to place those two Gaussian primes between the columns.

214
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,280
However, since multiplying one of these guys by i gives you the other one,

215
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,740
when you swap them between the columns, the effect that that has on the output from the left column

216
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,300
is to just multiply it by i, or by negative i.

217
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,180
So that's actually redundant with the final step,

218
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:45,680
where we take the product of this left column and choose to multiply it by either 1, i, negative 1, or negative i.

219
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,240
What this means is that a factor of 2, or any power of 2, doesn't actually change the count at all.

220
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,620
It doesn't hurt, but it doesn't help.

221
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,860
For example, a circle with radius square root of 5 hits 8 lattice points.

222
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,620
And if you grow that radius to square root of 10, then you also hit 8 lattice points.

223
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,160
And square root of 20 also hits 8 lattice points, as does square root of 40.

224
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,080
Factors of 2 just don't make a difference.

225
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,320
Now what's about to happen is number theory at its best.

226
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:24,540
We have this complicated recipe telling us how many lattice points sit on a circle with radius square root of n,

227
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,720
and it depends on the prime factorization of n.

228
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,020
To turn this into something simpler, something we can actually deal with,

229
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:39,840
we're going to exploit the regularity of primes that those which are 1 above a multiple of 4 split into distinct Gaussian prime factors,

230
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,500
while those that are 3 above a multiple of 4 cannot be split.

231
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,760
To do this, let's introduce a simple function, one which I'll label with the Greek letter chi.

232
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,820
For inputs that are 1 above a multiple of 4, the output of chi is just 1.

233
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,900
If it takes in an input 3 above a multiple of 4, then the output of chi is negative 1.

234
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,240
And then on all even numbers, it gives 0.

235
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,780
So if you evaluate chi on the natural numbers, it gives this very nice cyclic pattern,

236
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,360
1, 0, negative 1, 0, and then repeat indefinitely.

237
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,160
And this cyclic function chi has a very special property.

238
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,660
It's what's called a multiplicative function.

239
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,280
If you evaluate it on two different numbers and multiply the results, like chi of 3 times chi of 5,

240
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,780
it's the same as if you evaluate chi on the product of those two numbers, in this case chi of 15.

241
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,800
Likewise, chi of 5 times chi of 5 is equal to chi of 25,

242
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,160
and no matter what two natural numbers you put in there, this property will hold.

243
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,880
Go ahead, try it if you want.

244
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,240
So for our central question of counting lattice points in this way that involves factoring a number,

245
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,820
what I'm going to do is write down the number of choices we have but using chi

246
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,180
in what at first seems like a much more complicated way,

247
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,560
but this has the benefit of treating all prime factors equally.

248
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:19,260
For each prime power, like 5 cubed, what you write down is chi of 1 plus chi of 5 plus chi of 5 squared plus chi of 5 cubed.

249
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,220
You add up the value of chi on all the powers of this prime up to the one that shows up inside the factorization.

250
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,240
In this case, since 5 is 1 above a multiple of 4, all of these are just 1,

251
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:39,400
so this sum comes out to be 4, which reflects the fact that a factor of 5 cubed gives you 4 options

252
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,700
for how to divvy up the two Gaussian prime factors between the columns.

253
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:54,960
For a factor like 3 to the 4th, what you write down looks totally similar, chi of 1 plus chi of 3 on and on up to chi of 3 to the 4th.

254
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:03,720
But in this case, since chi of 3 is negative 1, this sum oscillates, it goes 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 plus 1.

255
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,260
And if it's an even power, like 4 in this case, the total sum comes out to be 1,

256
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,720
which encapsulates the fact that there is only one choice for what to do with those unsplittable 3's.

257
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,820
But if it's an odd power, that sum comes out to 0, indicating that you're screwed, you can't place that unsplittable 3.

258
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:33,380
When you do this for a power of 2, what it looks like is 1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 on and on, since chi is always 0 on even numbers.

259
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,060
And this reflects the fact that a factor of 2 doesn't help and it doesn't hurt, you always have just one option for what to do with it.

260
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,900
And as always, we keep a 4 in front to indicate that final choice of multiplying by 1, i, negative 1, or negative i.

261
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,440
We're getting close to the culmination now. Things are starting to look organized, so take a moment, pause and ponder, make sure everything feels good up to this point.

262
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:12,440
Take the number 45 as an example. This guy factors as 3 squared times 5, so the expression for the total number of lattice points is 4 times chi of 1 plus chi of 3 plus chi of 3 squared times chi of 1 plus chi of 5.

263
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:21,260
You can think about this as 4 times the one choice for what to do with the 3's times two choices for how to divvy up the Gaussian prime factors of 5.

264
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:29,860
It might seem like expanding out this sum is really complicated, because it involves all possible combinations of these prime factors.

265
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:38,940
And it kind of is. However, because chi is multiplicative, each one of those combinations corresponds to a divisor of 45.

266
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:50,380
In this case, we get 4 times chi of 1 plus chi of 3 plus chi of 5 plus chi of 9 plus chi of 15 plus chi of 45.

267
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,160
What you'll notice is that this covers every number that divides evenly into 45, once and only once.

268
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,480
And it works like this for any number, there's nothing special about 45.

269
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,760
And that to me is pretty interesting, and I think wholly unexpected.

270
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,360
This question of counting the number of lattice points a distance square root of n away from the origin,

271
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,480
involves adding up the value of this relatively simple function over all the divisors of n.

272
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,720
To bring it all together, remember why we're doing this.

273
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,040
The total number of lattice points inside a big circle with radius r should be about pi times r squared.

274
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,500
But on the other hand, we can count those same lattice points by looking through all of the numbers n between 0 and r squared,

275
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,280
and counting how many lattice points are a distance square root of n from the origin.

276
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,780
Let's go ahead and just ignore that origin dot with radius 0, it doesn't really follow the pattern of the rest,

277
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,060
and one little dot isn't going to make a difference as we let r grow towards infinity.

278
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,480
Now from all of this Gaussian integer and factoring and chi function stuff that we've been doing,

279
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:06,140
the answer for each n looks like adding up the value of chi on every divisor of n, and then multiplying by 4.

280
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,600
And for now let's just take that 4 and put it in the corner, and remember to bring it back later.

281
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,340
At first, adding up the values for each one of these rows seems super random, right?

282
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,880
I mean, numbers with a lot of factors have a lot of divisors, whereas prime numbers will always only have two divisors.

283
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:33,140
So it initially seems like you would have to have perfect knowledge of the distribution of primes to get anything useful out of this.

284
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,040
But if instead you organize these into columns, the puzzle starts to fit together.

285
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,920
How many numbers between 1 and r squared have 1 as a divisor?

286
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,200
Well, all of them. So our sum should include r squared times chi of 1.

287
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,320
How many of them have 2 as a divisor?

288
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,520
Well, about half of them. So that would account for about r squared over 2 times chi of 2.

289
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,120
About a third of these rows have chi of 3, so we can put in r squared divided by 3 times chi of 3.

290
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:14,540
And keep in mind we're being approximate since r squared might not perfectly divide 2 or 3, but as r grows towards infinity, this approximation will get better.

291
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,200
And when you keep going like this, you get a pretty organized expression for the total number of lattice points.

292
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,620
And if you factor out that r squared and then bring back the 4 that needs to be multiplied in,

293
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:38,000
what it means is that the total number of lattice points inside this big circle is approximately 4 times r squared times this sum.

294
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:45,380
And because chi is 0 on every even number, and it oscillates between 1 and negative 1 for odd numbers,

295
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:52,600
this sum looks like 1 minus 1 third plus a fifth minus 1 seventh and so on.

296
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,360
And this is exactly what we wanted.

297
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,960
What we have here is an alternate expression for the total number of lattice points inside a big circle,

298
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,060
which we know should be around pi times r squared.

299
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,100
And the bigger r is, the more accurate both of these estimates are,

300
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,340
so the percent error between the left-hand side and the right-hand side can get arbitrarily small.

301
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,140
So divide out by that r squared, and this gives us an infinite sum that should converge to pi.

302
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,160
And keep in mind, I just think this is really cool.

303
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,000
The reason that this sum came out to be so simple, requiring relatively low information to describe,

304
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,260
ultimately stems from the regular pattern and how prime numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers.

305
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:43,600
If you're curious, there are two main branches of number theory, algebraic number theory and analytic number theory.

306
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,040
Very loosely speaking, the former deals with new number systems,

307
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,860
things like these Gaussian integers that you and I looked at, and a lot more.

308
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,720
And the latter deals with things like the Riemann zeta function, or its cousins, called L-functions,

309
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,200
which involve multiplicative functions like this central character chi from our story.

310
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,300
And the path that we just walked is a little glimpse at where those two fields intersect.

311
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,400
And both of these are pretty heavy-duty fields with a lot of active research and unsolved problems.

312
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,120
So if all this feels like something that takes time to mentally digest,

313
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,700
like there's more patterns to be uncovered and understood, it's because it is, and there are.
