00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
You guys know Henry from MinutePhysics, right?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,920
Well, he and I just made a video on a certain quantum mechanical topic, Bell's inequalities.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,720
It's a really mind-warping topic that not enough people know about, and even though

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,440
it's a quantum thing, it's based on some surprisingly simple math, and you should definitely

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
check it out.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,920
For this video, we have in mind those viewers who actually want to learn some quantum mechanics

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,080
more deeply.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,360
And obviously it's a huge topic, nowhere near the scope of a single video, but the

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,820
question we asked was what topic could we present that's not meant to be some eye-catching

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,320
piece of quantum weirdness, but which actually lays down some useful foundations for anyone

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,440
who wants to learn this field?

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,720
What topic would set the right intuitions for someone before they dove into, say, the

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Feynman lectures?

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,880
Well, a natural place to start, where quantum mechanics itself started, is light.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Specifically, if you want to learn quantum, you have to have an understanding of waves,

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,920
and how they're described mathematically.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,980
And what we'd like to build to here is the relationship between the energy in a purely

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,720
classical wave, and the probabilities that govern quantum behavior.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
In fact, we'll actually spend most of the time talking through the pre-quantum understanding

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,440
of light, since that sets up a lot of the relevant wave mechanics.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,600
The thing is, a lot of ideas from quantum mechanics, like describing states as superpositions

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,360
with various amplitudes and phases, come up in the context of classical waves in a way

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,280
that doesn't involve any of the quantum weirdness people might be familiar with.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
This also helps to appreciate what's actually different in quantum mechanics, namely certain

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,400
restrictions on how much energy these waves can have, how they behave when measured, and

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,240
quantum entanglement, though we won't cover entanglement in this video.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,680
So we'll start with the late 1800s understanding of light as waves in the electromagnetic field.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Here, let's break that down a bit.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,080
The electric field is a vector field, and that means every point in space has some arrow

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,760
attached to it indicating the direction and strength of the field.

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Now, the physical meaning of those arrows is that if you have some charged particle

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,920
in space, there's going to be a force on that particle in the direction of the arrow, and

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
it's proportional to the length of the arrow and the specific charge of the particle.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,740
Likewise, the magnetic field is another vector field, where now the physical meaning of each

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,640
arrow is that when a charged particle is moving through that space, there's going to be a

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,460
force perpendicular to both its direction of motion and to the direction of the magnetic

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:28,620
field, and the strength of that force is proportional to the charge of the particle, its velocity,

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,960
and the length of the magnetic field arrow.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,500
For example, a wire with a current of moving charges next to a magnet is either pushed

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,700
or pulled by that magnetic field.

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,680
A kind of culmination of the 19th century physics understanding of how these two fields

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,340
work are Maxwell's equations, which among other things describe how each of these fields

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,580
can cause a change to the other.

44
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,540
Specifically, what Maxwell's equations tell us is that when the electric field arrows

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,300
seem to be forming a loop around some region, the magnetic field will be increasing inside

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,580
that region perpendicular to the plane of the loop, and symmetrically, such a loop in

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,340
the magnetic field corresponds to a change in the electric field within it perpendicular

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,660
to the plane of the loop.

49
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,780
Now, the specifics for how exactly these equations work is really beautiful and worth a full

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,540
video on its own, but all you need to know for now is that one natural consequence of

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,380
this mutual interplay in how changes to one field cause changes to the other in its neighboring

52
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,860
regions is that you get these propagating waves where the electric field and magnetic

53
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,780
fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,420
propagation.

55
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,900
When you hear the term electromagnetic radiation, which refers to things like radio waves and

56
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,820
visible light, this is what it's talking about, propagating waves in both the electric

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,020
and magnetic fields.

58
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,540
Of course, it's now almost mainstream to know of light as electromagnetic radiation,

59
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,540
but it's neat to think about just how surprising this was in Maxwell's time, that these fields

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,460
that have to do with forces on charged particles and magnets not only have something to do

61
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,040
with light, but that what light is is a propagating wave as these two fields dance with each other

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,420
causing this mutual oscillation of increasing and decreasing field strength.

63
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,700
With this as a visual, let's take a moment to lay down the math used to describe waves.

64
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,340
It'll still be purely classical, but ideas that are core to quantum mechanics, like superposition,

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,540
amplitudes, phases, all of these come up in this context, and I would argue with a clearer

66
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,440
motivation for what they actually mean.

67
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,940
Take this wave and think of it as directed straight out of the screen, towards your face.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,740
And let's go ahead and ignore the magnetic field right now, just looking at how the electric

69
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,260
field oscillates.

70
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,020
And also we're only going to focus on one of these vectors oscillating in the plane

71
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,620
of the screen, which we'll think of as the xy plane.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,100
If it oscillates horizontally, like this, we say that the light is horizontally polarized.

73
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,240
So the y component of this electric field is 0 at all times, and we might write the

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,080
x component as something like cosine of 2 pi times ft, where f represents some frequency

75
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,160
and t is time.

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,680
So if f was 1, for example, that means it takes exactly 1 second for this cosine function

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,920
to go through a full cycle.

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,640
For a lower frequency, that would mean it takes more time for the cosine to go through

79
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,240
its full cycle.

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,620
As the value t increases, the inside of this cosine function increases more slowly.

81
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,980
Also we're going to include another term in here, phi, called the phase shift, which

82
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,680
tells us where this vector is in its cycle at time t equals 0.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
You'll see why that matters in just a moment.

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,340
By default, cosine only oscillates between negative 1 and 1, so let's put another term

85
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,820
in front, a, that gives us the amplitude of this wave.

86
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,780
One more thing, just to make things look a little more like they often do in quantum

87
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,020
mechanics, instead of writing it as a column vector, like this, I'm going to separate

88
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,120
it out into two different components using these symbols called kets.

89
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,020
This ket here indicates a unit vector in the horizontal direction, and this ket over here

90
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,180
represents a unit vector in the vertical direction.

91
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,580
If the light is vertically polarized, meaning the electric field is wiggling purely in the

92
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,780
up and down direction, its equation might look like this, where the horizontal component

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,260
is now 0, and the vertical component is a cosine with some frequency, amplitude, and

94
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,140
a phase shift.

95
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,640
Now if you have two distinct waves, two waves of wiggling through space over time that solve

96
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,600
Maxwell's equations, then adding both of these together gives another valid wave, at

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,240
least in a vacuum.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,760
That is, at each point in time, add these two vectors tip to tail to get a new vector.

99
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,200
Doing this at all points in space and all points in time gives a new, valid solution

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,000
to Maxwell's equations, at least this is all true in a vacuum.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,040
This is because Maxwell's equations in a vacuum are what's called linear equations.

102
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,480
They're essentially a combination of derivatives acting on the electric and magnetic fields

103
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,960
to give 0, so if one field f1 satisfies this equation and another field f2 satisfies it,

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,320
then their sum f1 plus f2 also satisfies it, since derivatives are linear.

105
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,360
So the sum of two or more solutions to Maxwell's equations is also a solution to Maxwell's

106
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,880
equations.

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,760
This new wave is called a superposition of the first two.

108
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,120
And here superposition essentially just means sum, or in some context weighted sum, since

109
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,120
if you include some kind of amplitude and phase shift in each of these components, it

110
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,480
can still be called a superposition of the two original vectors.

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,560
Right now, the resulting superposition is a wave wiggling in the diagonal direction,

112
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,920
but if the horizontal and vertical components were out of phase with each other, which might

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,520
happen if you increase the phase shift in one of them, their sum might instead trace

114
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,680
out some sort of ellipse, in the case where the phases are exactly 90 degrees out of sync

115
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,120
with each other, and the amplitudes are both equal, this is what we call circularly polarized

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
light.

117
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,680
This, by the way, is why it's important to keep track not just of the amplitude in

118
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:13,120
each direction, but also of the phase, it affects the way the two waves add together.

119
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,360
That's also an important idea that carries over to quantum, and underlies some of the

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,880
things that look confusing at first.

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,080
And here's another important idea, we're describing waves by adding together the horizontal

122
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
and vertical components, but we could also choose to describe everything with respect

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
to different directions.

124
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,400
I mean, you could describe waves as some superposition of the diagonal and the anti-diagonal directions.

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,780
In that case, vertically polarized light would actually be a superposition of these two diagonal

126
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,720
wiggling directions, at least when both are in phase with each other and have the same

127
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,440
magnitude.

128
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,080
The choice of which directions you write things in terms of is called a basis, and which basis

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,920
is nicest to work with, well, that typically depends on what you're doing with the light.

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,880
For example, if you have a polarizing filter, like that from a set of polarized sunglasses,

131
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,040
the way these work is by absorbing the energy from electromagnetic oscillations in some

132
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,760
particular direction.

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,240
A vertically oriented polarizer, for example, would absorb all of the energy from these

134
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,740
waves along the horizontal directions, at least classically that's how you might think

135
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
about it.

136
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,500
So, if you're analyzing light and it's passing through a filter like this, it's nice to describe

137
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,100
it with respect to the horizontal and vertical directions.

138
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,240
That way what you can say is that whatever light passes through the filter is just the

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
vertical component of the original wave.

140
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,540
But if you had a filter oriented, say, diagonally, well, then it would be convenient to describe

141
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,380
things as a superposition of that diagonal direction and its perpendicular anti-diagonal

142
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,580
direction.

143
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,060
These ideas will carry over almost word for word to the quantum case.

144
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,220
Quantum states, much like this wiggling direction of our wave, are described as a superposition

145
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,120
of multiple base states, where you have many choices for what base states to use.

146
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,700
And just like with classical waves, the components of such a superposition will have both an

147
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,340
amplitude and a phase of some kind.

148
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,620
And by the way, for those of you who do read more into quantum mechanics, you'll find that

149
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,620
these components are actually given using a single complex number rather than a cosine

150
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,380
expression like this one.

151
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,380
One way to think of this is that complex numbers are just a very convenient and natural mathematical

152
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,420
way to encode an amplitude and a phase with a single value.

153
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,580
That can make things a little confusing because it's hard to visualize a pair of complex numbers,

154
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,840
which is what would describe a superposition of two base states.

155
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,680
But you can think about the use of complex numbers throughout quantum mechanics as a

156
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,140
result of its underlying wavy nature, and this need to encapsulate the amplitude and

157
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,180
the phase for each direction.

158
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,900
Okay, just one quick point before getting into the quantum.

159
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,780
Look at one of these waves and focus just on the electric field portion like we were

160
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
before.

161
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,780
Classically, we think about the energy of a wave like this as being proportional to

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,220
the square of its amplitude.

163
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,980
And I want you to notice how well this lines up with the Pythagorean theorem.

164
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,660
If you were to describe this wave as a superposition of a horizontal component with amplitude Ax

165
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,260
and a vertical component with amplitude Ay, then its energy density is proportional to

166
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,360
Ax2 plus Ay2.

167
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,420
And you can think of this in two different ways.

168
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,020
Either it's because you're adding up the energies of each component in the superposition,

169
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,380
or it's just that you're figuring out the new amplitude using the Pythagorean theorem

170
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,740
and taking the square.

171
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,580
Isn't that nice?

172
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,100
In the classical understanding of light, you should be able to dial this energy up and

173
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,100
down continuously however you want by changing the amplitude of the wave.

174
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,940
But what physicists started to notice in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that

175
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,180
this energy actually seems to come in discrete amounts.

176
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,360
Specifically, the energy of one of these electromagnetic waves always seems to come as an integer multiple

177
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,340
of a specific constant times the frequency of that wave.

178
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,660
We now call this constant Planck's constant, commonly denoting it with the letter H. Physically,

179
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,940
what this means is that whenever this wave trades its energy with something else, like

180
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,860
an electron, the amount of energy it trades off is always an integer multiple of H times

181
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,100
its frequency.

182
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,620
Importantly, this means there is some minimal non-zero energy level for waves of a given

183
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,700
frequency – Hf.

184
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,240
If you have an electromagnetic wave with this frequency and energy, you cannot make it smaller

185
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,460
without eliminating it entirely.

186
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,380
That feels weird when the conception of a wave is a nice continuously oscillating vector

187
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
field.

188
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,900
But that's not how the universe works, as late 19th and early 20th century experiments

189
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,500
started to expose.

190
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,620
In fact, I've done a video about this called the Origin of Quantum Mechanics.

191
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,900
However, it's worth noting that this phenomenon is actually common in waves when they're

192
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,420
constrained in certain ways, like in pipes or instrument strings, and it's called harmonics.

193
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,820
What's weird is that electromagnetic waves do this in free space, even when they're

194
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,780
not constrained.

195
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,460
And what do we call an electromagnetic wave with this minimal possible energy?

196
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,460
A photon.

197
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,880
But like I said, the math used to describe classical electromagnetic waves carries over

198
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
to describing a photon.

199
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,360
It might have, say, a 45 degree diagonal polarization, which can be described as a superposition

200
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,800
of a purely horizontal state and a purely vertical state, where each one of these components

201
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,200
has some amplitude and phase.

202
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,120
And with a different choice in bases, that same state might be described as a superposition

203
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,100
of two other directions.

204
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,400
All of this is stuff you would see if you started reading more into quantum mechanics.

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,040
But this superposition has a different interpretation than before, and it has to.

206
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's say you were thinking of this diagonally polarized photon kind of classically, and

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,400
you said it has an amplitude of one unit for some appropriate unit system.

208
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,660
That would make the hypothetical amplitudes of its horizontal and vertical components

209
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,240
each the square root of one half.

210
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,720
And like Henry said, the energy of a photon is this special constant h times its frequency.

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,560
And because in a classical setting, energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude

212
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,000
of this wave, it's tempting to think of half of the energy as being in the horizontal

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,400
component, and half of it as being in the vertical component.

214
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,720
But waves of this frequency cannot have half the energy of a photon.

215
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,680
I mean, the whole novelty of quantum here is that energy comes in these discrete, indivisible

216
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
chunks.

217
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,040
So these components, with an imagined amplitude of one over the square root of two, could

218
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,640
not exist in isolation.

219
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,920
And you might wonder what exactly they mean.

220
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,040
Well, let's get experimental about it.

221
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,920
If you were to take a vertically oriented polarizing filter, and shoot this diagonally

222
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,040
polarized photon right at it, what do you think would happen?

223
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,080
Classically, the way you'd interpret this superposition is that the half of its energy

224
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,240
in the horizontal direction would be absorbed.

225
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,440
But because energy comes in these discrete photon packets, it either has to pass through

226
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
with all of its energy, or get absorbed entirely.

227
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,800
And if you actually did this experiment, about half the time the photon goes through entirely,

228
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,840
and about half the time it gets absorbed entirely.

229
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,840
And it appears to be random whether a given photon passes through or not.

230
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,680
If it does pass through, forcing it to make a decision like this actually changes it so

231
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,000
that its polarization is oriented along the filter's direction.

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,800
This is analogous to the classic Schrodinger's cat setup.

233
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,960
You have something that's in a superposition of two states, but once you make a measurement

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,840
of that superposition, forcing it to interact with an observer in a way where each of those

235
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,960
two states would behave differently, from the perspective of that observer, this superposition

236
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:40,400
collapses to be entirely in one state or entirely in another, dead or alive, horizontal or vertical.

237
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,760
One pretty neat way to see this in action, which Henry and I talk about in the other

238
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,280
video, is to take several polarized sunglasses, or some other form of polarizing filters,

239
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,080
and start by holding two of them between you and some light source.

240
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,560
If you rotate them to be 90 degrees off from each other, the light source is blacked out

241
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,200
completely, or at least with perfect filters it would be, because all of the photons passing

242
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,540
through that first one are polarized vertically, so they actually have a 0% chance of passing

243
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,440
a filter oriented horizontally.

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,520
But if you insert a third filter oriented at a 45 degree angle between the two, it actually

245
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,720
lets more light through.

246
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,400
And what's going on here is that 50% of the photons passing that vertical filter will

247
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,520
also pass through the diagonal filter, and once they do, they're going to be changed

248
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,000
to have a purely diagonal polarization, and then once they're in that state, they have

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,680
a 50-50 chance of passing through the filter oriented at 90 degrees.

250
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,740
So even though 0% of the photons passing through the first would pass through that

251
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,800
last if nothing was in between, by introducing another filter, 25% of them now pass through

252
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
all three.

253
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,760
That's something you couldn't explain unless that middle filter forces the photons

254
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,840
to change their states.

255
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,920
And that experiment, by the way, becomes all the weirder when you dig into the specific

256
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,100
probabilities for angles between 0 and 45 degrees, and that's actually what we talk

257
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,120
about in the other video.

258
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,120
For example, one specific value we focus on there is the probability that a photon whose

259
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:19,360
polarization is 22.5 degrees off the direction of a filter will pass through that filter.

260
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,320
Again, it's helpful to think of this wave as having an amplitude of 1, and then you'd

261
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,620
think of the horizontal component as having an amplitude sin of 22.5 degrees, which is

262
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:36,360
around 0.38, and the vertical component would have an amplitude cos of 22.5 degrees, which

263
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,480
is around 0.92.

264
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,840
Classically, you might think of its horizontal component as having energy proportional to

265
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,160
0.38 squared, which is around 0.15.

266
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,360
Likewise, you might think of the vertical component as having an energy proportional

267
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,240
to 0.92 squared, which comes out to be around 0.85.

268
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,960
And like we said before, classically, this would mean if you pass it through a vertical

269
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,280
filter, 15% of its energy is absorbed in the horizontal direction.

270
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,480
But because the energy of light comes in these discrete quanta that cannot be subdivided,

271
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,240
instead what you observe is that 85% of the time the photon passes through entirely, and

272
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,800
15% of the time it gets completely blocked.

273
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,060
Now I want to emphasize that the wave equations don't change.

274
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,900
The photon is still described as a superposition of two oscillating components, each with some

275
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,580
phase and amplitude, often encoded using a single complex number.

276
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,220
The difference is that classically the squares of the amplitudes of each component tell you

277
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,320
the amount of that wave's energy in each direction, but with quantized light at this

278
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,680
minimal non-zero energy level, the squares of those amplitudes tell you the probabilities

279
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,320
that a given photon is going to be found to have all of its energy in one direction

280
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
or not.

281
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,800
Also, these components could still have some kind of phase difference.

282
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,840
Just like with classical waves, photons can be circularly polarized, and there exist polarizing

283
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,920
filters that only let through photons that are polarized circularly, say in the clockwise

284
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,320
direction.

285
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,700
Or rather, they let through all photons probabilistically, where the probabilities are determined by

286
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,100
describing each one of those photons as a superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise

287
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,620
states, and then the square of the amplitude of the clockwise component gives you the desired

288
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,460
probability.

289
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,340
Photons are of course just one quantum phenomenon, one where we initially understood it as a

290
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,660
wave thanks to Maxwell's equations, and then as individual particles or quanta, hence

291
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,040
the name quantum mechanics.

292
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,380
But as many of you well know, there's a flip side to this where many things that were

293
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,180
understood to come in discrete little packets, like electrons, were discovered to be governed

294
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,960
by similar, wavy quantum mechanics.

295
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,940
In cases way more general than this one-photon polarization example, quantum mechanical states

296
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,220
are described as some superposition of multiple base states, and the superposition depends

297
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,060
on what basis you choose.

298
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,300
Each component in this superposition is given with an amplitude and a phase, often encoded

299
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,740
as a single complex number, and the need for this phase arises from the wave nature of

300
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,180
these objects.

301
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,780
As with the photon example, the choice of how to measure these objects can determine

302
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,480
a set of base states, where the probability of measuring a particle to be in one of these

303
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,900
base states is proportional to the squares of the amplitudes of these numbers.

304
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,820
It's funny to think though that if the wavy nature of electrons and other particles was

305
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,180
discovered first, we might instead refer to the whole subject as harmonic mechanics or

306
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,260
something like that, since the weirdness there is not that waves come in discrete units,

307
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,980
but that particles are governed by wave equations.

308
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,020
This video was supported in part by Brilliant, and as viewers of this channel know, what

309
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,540
I like about Brilliant is that they're a great complement to passively watching educational

310
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
videos.

311
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,260
All of you here want to learn more math, or physics, or the math that prepares you for

312
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,840
physics, and the only way to actually learn this stuff is to actively grapple with puzzles

313
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,500
and problem solving.

314
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Brilliant offers many really well curated sequences of problems that help you to master

315
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,700
all sorts of technical subjects.

316
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,620
You all like physics, clearly, so I think you would enjoy their courses on classical

317
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,940
mechanics and gravitational physics, and honestly group theory would give you a really good

318
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,980
foundation, but there are many other great courses too, especially in math.

319
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,300
If you go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b, that one lets them know you came from here, and

320
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,360
also the first 200 people that go to that link are going to get 20% off the annual Brilliant

321
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,220
Premium subscription.

322
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,380
That's the subscription I've been using, and it's actually really fun to have a bank

323
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,740
of these puzzles and problems.

324
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,800
But of course, for those of you who want some more passive viewing, don't forget that

325
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,580
Henry and I just put out a video on Bell's inequalities over on MinutePhysics.

326
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,980
If for some reason you haven't been following MinutePhysics these days, and I don't know

327
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,700
why you wouldn't have been, the videos there have been really top notch, so definitely

328
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,780
take a moment to poke around the rest of his channel.
