00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
You guys know Henry from MinutePhysics, right?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,360
Well, he and I just made a video on a certain quantum mechanical topic, Bell's inequalities.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,820
It's a really mind-warping topic that not enough people know about, and even though

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,380
it's a quantum thing, it's based on some surprisingly simple math, and you should definitely

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,120
check it out.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,920
For this video, we have in mind those viewers who actually want to learn some quantum mechanics

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,520
more deeply.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,480
And obviously it's a huge topic, nowhere near the scope of a single video, but the

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,820
question we asked was what topic could we present that's not meant to be some eye-catching

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,340
piece of quantum weirdness, but which actually lays down some useful foundations for anyone

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,700
who wants to learn this field?

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,880
What topic would set the right intuitions for someone before they dove into, say, the

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,520
Feynman lectures?

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,540
Well, a natural place to start, where quantum mechanics itself started, is light.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,600
Specifically, if you want to learn quantum, you have to have an understanding of waves

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
and how they're described mathematically.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,060
And what we'd like to build to here is the relationship between the energy in a purely

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,860
classical wave and the probabilities that govern quantum behavior.

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,880
In fact, we'll actually spend most of the time talking through the pre-quantum understanding

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,920
of light, since that sets up a lot of the relevant wave mechanics.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,620
The thing is, a lot of ideas from quantum mechanics, like describing states as superpositions

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,460
with various amplitudes and phases, come up in the context of classical waves in a way

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,840
that doesn't involve any of the quantum weirdness people might be familiar with.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,440
This also helps to appreciate what's actually different in quantum mechanics, namely certain

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,460
restrictions on how much energy these waves can have, how they behave when measured, and

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,520
quantum entanglement, though we won't cover entanglement in this video.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,520
So we'll start with the late 1800s understanding of light as waves in the electromagnetic field.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
Here, let's break that down a bit.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,180
The electric field is a vector field, and that means every point in space has some arrow

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,520
attached to it, indicating the direction and strength of the field.

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,760
Now, the physical meaning of those arrows is that if you have some charged particle

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,880
in space, there's going to be a force on that particle in the direction of the arrow, and

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,440
it's proportional to the length of the arrow and the specific charge of the particle.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,820
Likewise, the magnetic field is another vector field, where now the physical meaning of each

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,740
arrow is that when a charged particle is moving through that space, there's going to be a

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,460
force perpendicular to both its direction of motion and to the direction of the magnetic

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,960
field, and the strength of that force is proportional to the charge of the particle, its velocity,

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,460
and the length of the magnetic field arrow.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,420
For example, a wire with a current of moving charges next to a magnet is either pushed

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,220
or pulled by that magnetic field.

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,720
A kind of culmination of the 19th century physics understanding of how these two fields

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,380
work are Maxwell's equations, which among other things describe how each of these fields

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,060
can cause a change to the other.

44
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,460
Specifically, what Maxwell's equations tell us is that when the electric field arrows

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,300
seem to be forming a loop around some region, the magnetic field will be increasing inside

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,600
that region perpendicular to the plane of the loop, and symmetrically, such a loop in

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,140
the magnetic field corresponds to a change in the electric field within it perpendicular

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,360
to the plane of the loop.

49
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,880
Now, the specifics for how exactly these equations work is really beautiful and worth a full

50
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,600
video on its own, but all you need to know for now is that one natural consequence of

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,360
this mutual interplay in how changes to one field cause changes to the other in its neighboring

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,880
regions is that you get these propagating waves where the electric field and magnetic

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,880
fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,540
propagation.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
When you hear the term electromagnetic radiation, which refers to things like radio waves and

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,740
visible light, this is what it's talking about, propagating waves in both the electric

57
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,040
and magnetic fields.

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,080
Of course, it's now almost mainstream to know of light as electromagnetic radiation,

59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,560
but it's neat to think about just how surprising this was in Maxwell's time, that these fields

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,540
that have to do with forces on charged particles and magnets not only have something to do

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,120
with light, but that what light is is a propagating wave as these two fields dance with each other

62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,660
causing this mutual oscillation of increasing and decreasing field strength.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,600
With this as a visual, let's take a moment to lay down the math used to describe waves.

64
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,140
It'll still be purely classical, but ideas that are core to quantum mechanics, like superposition,

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,600
amplitudes, phases, all of these come up in this context, and I would argue with a clearer

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,460
motivation for what they actually mean.

67
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,280
Take this wave and think of it as directed straight out of the screen, towards your face.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,780
And let's go ahead and ignore the magnetic field right now, just looking at how the electric

69
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,680
field oscillates.

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
And also, we're only going to focus on one of these vectors oscillating in the plane

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
of the screen, which we'll think of as the xy plane.

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,320
If it oscillates horizontally, like this, we say that the light is horizontally polarized.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,320
So the y component of this electric field is 0 at all times, and we might write the

74
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,640
x component as something like cosine of 2 pi times ft, where f represents some frequency,

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,380
and t is time.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,660
So if f was 1, for example, that means it takes exactly 1 second for this cosine function

77
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,040
to go through a full cycle.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,700
For a lower frequency, that would mean it takes more time for the cosine to go through

79
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,440
its full cycle.

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,400
As the value t increases, the inside of this cosine function increases more slowly.

81
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,080
Also we're going to include another term in here, phi, called the phase shift, which

82
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,400
tells us where this vector is in its cycle at time t equals 0.

83
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,480
You'll see why that matters in just a moment.

84
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,400
By default, cosine only oscillates between negative 1 and 1, so let's put another term

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,760
in front, a, that gives us the amplitude of this wave.

86
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,800
One more thing, just to make things look a little more like they often do in quantum

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,020
mechanics, instead of writing it as a column vector, like this, I'm going to separate

88
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,360
it out into two different components using these symbols called kets.

89
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,440
This ket here indicates a unit vector in the horizontal direction, and this ket here represents

90
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,580
a unit vector in the vertical direction.

91
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,660
If the light is vertically polarized, meaning the electric field is wiggling purely in the

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,600
up and down direction, its equation might look like this, where the horizontal component

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,280
is now 0, and the vertical component is a cosine with some frequency, amplitude, and

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,940
phase shift.

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Now if you have two distinct waves, two ways of wiggling through space over time that solve

96
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,700
Maxwell's equations, then adding both of these together gives another valid wave, at

97
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,480
least in a vacuum.

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,020
That is, at each point in time, add these two vectors tip to tail to get a new vector.

99
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,180
Doing this at all points in space and all points in time gives a new, valid solution

100
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,260
to Maxwell's equations, at least this is all true in a vacuum.

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,060
This is because Maxwell's equations in a vacuum are what's called linear equations.

102
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,340
They're essentially a combination of derivatives acting on the electric and magnetic fields

103
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,680
to give 0, so if one field f1 satisfies this equation and another field f2 satisfies it,

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,780
then their sum, f1 plus f2, also satisfies it, since derivatives are linear.

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,980
So the sum of two or more solutions to Maxwell's equations is also a solution to Maxwell's equations.

106
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,540
This new wave is called a superposition of the first two.

107
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,140
And here, superposition essentially just means sum, or in some context, weighted sum, since

108
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,180
if you include some kind of amplitude and phase shift in each of these components, it

109
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,380
can still be called a superposition of the two original vectors.

110
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,000
Now right now, the resulting superposition is a wave wiggling in the diagonal direction,

111
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,980
but if the horizontal and vertical components were out of phase with each other, which might

112
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,620
happen if you increase the phase shift in one of them, their sum might instead trace

113
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,440
out some sort of ellipse, and in the case where the phases are exactly 90 degrees out

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,640
of sync with each other, and the amplitudes are both equal, this is what we call circularly

115
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,500
polarized light.

116
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,940
This by the way is why it's important to keep track not just of the amplitude in each

117
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,360
direction but also of the phase, it affects the way the two waves add together.

118
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,480
That's also an important idea that carries over to quantum, and underlies some of the

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,940
things that look confusing at first.

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,040
And here's another important idea, we're describing waves by adding together the horizontal

121
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,300
and vertical components, but we could also choose to describe everything with respect

122
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,440
to different directions.

123
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,660
I mean, you could describe waves as some superposition of the diagonal and the anti-diagonal directions.

124
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,820
In that case, vertically polarized light would actually be a superposition of these two diagonal

125
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,660
wiggling directions, at least when both are in phase with each other and have the same

126
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,160
magnitude.

127
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,140
The choice of which directions you write things in terms of is called a basis, and which basis

128
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,480
is nicest to work with, well that typically depends on what you're doing with the light.

129
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,240
For example, if you have a polarizing filter, like that from a set of polarized sunglasses,

130
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,180
the way these work is by absorbing the energy from electromagnetic oscillations in some

131
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
particular direction.

132
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,320
A vertically oriented polarizer, for example, would absorb all of the energy from these

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
waves along the horizontal directions, at least classically that's how you might think

134
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,400
about it.

135
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,520
So, if you're analyzing light and it's passing through a filter like this, it's nice to describe

136
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,400
it with respect to the horizontal and vertical directions.

137
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,380
That way, what you can say is that whatever light passes through the filter is just the

138
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,900
vertical component of the original wave.

139
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,580
But if you had a filter oriented, say, diagonally, well then it would be convenient to describe

140
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,380
things as a superposition of that diagonal direction and its perpendicular anti-diagonal

141
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,980
direction.

142
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,200
These ideas will carry over almost word for word to the quantum case.

143
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,160
Quantum states, much like this wiggling direction of our wave, are described as a superposition

144
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,600
of multiple base states, where you have many choices for what base states to use.

145
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,860
And just like with classical waves, the components of such a superposition will have both an

146
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,640
amplitude and a phase of some kind.

147
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,700
And by the way, for those of you who do read more into quantum mechanics, you'll find that

148
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,740
these components are actually given using a single complex number, rather than a cosine

149
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,860
expression like this one.

150
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
One way to think of this is that complex numbers are just a very convenient and natural mathematical

151
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,540
way to encode an amplitude and a phase with a single value.

152
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,980
That can make things a little confusing because it's hard to visualize a pair of complex

153
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,280
numbers, which is what would describe a superposition of two base states.

154
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,820
But you can think about the use of complex numbers throughout quantum mechanics as a

155
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,200
result of its underlying wavy nature, and this need to encapsulate the amplitude and

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,520
the phase for each direction.

157
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,260
Okay, just one quick point before getting into the quantum.

158
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,740
Look at one of these waves, and focus just on the electric field portion like we were

159
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,220
before.

160
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,860
Classically, we think about the energy of a wave like this as being proportional to

161
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,340
the square of its amplitude.

162
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,280
And I want you to notice how well this lines up with the Pythagorean theorem.

163
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,220
If you were to describe this wave as a superposition of a horizontal component with amplitude Ax,

164
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,620
and a vertical component with amplitude Ay, then its energy density is proportional to

165
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Ax2 plus Ay2.

166
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,060
And you can think of this in two different ways.

167
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,200
Either it's because you're adding up the energies of each component in the superposition,

168
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,080
or it's just that you're figuring out the new amplitude using the Pythagorean theorem

169
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,220
and taking the square.

170
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,400
Isn't that nice?

171
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,180
In the classical understanding of light, you should be able to dial this energy up and

172
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,500
down continuously however you want by changing the amplitude of the wave.

173
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,980
But what physicists started to notice in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that

174
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,800
this energy actually seems to come in discrete amounts.

175
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,340
Specifically, the energy of one of these electromagnetic waves always seems to come as an integer multiple

176
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,980
of a specific constant times the frequency of that wave.

177
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,600
We now call this constant Planck's constant, commonly denoting it with the letter h.

178
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,460
Physically what this means is that whenever this wave trades its energy with something

179
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,020
else like an electron, the amount of energy it trades off is always an integer multiple

180
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,600
of h times its frequency.

181
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,680
Importantly, this means there is some minimal non-zero energy level for waves of a given

182
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,180
frequency, hf.

183
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,180
If you have an electromagnetic wave with this frequency and energy, you cannot make it smaller

184
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,700
without eliminating it entirely.

185
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,760
That feels weird when the conception of a wave is a nice continuously oscillating vector field.

186
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,900
But that's not how the universe works as late 19th and early 20th century experiments

187
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,880
started to expose.

188
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,340
In fact I've done a video about this called the origin of quantum mechanics.

189
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,340
However, it's worth noting that this phenomenon is actually common in waves when they're

190
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,160
constrained in certain ways, like in pipes or instrument strings, and it's called harmonics.

191
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,920
What's weird is that electromagnetic waves do this in free space, even when they're

192
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,780
not constrained.

193
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,020
And what do we call an electromagnetic wave with this minimal possible energy?

194
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,100
A photon.

195
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,960
But like I said, the math used to describe classical electromagnetic waves carries over

196
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,140
to describing a photon.

197
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,180
It might have, say, a 45 degree diagonal polarization, which can be described as a superposition

198
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,760
of a purely horizontal state and a purely vertical state, where each one of these components

199
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,380
has some amplitude and phase.

200
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,980
And with a different choice in basis, that same state might be described as a superposition

201
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,420
of two other directions.

202
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,800
All of this is stuff you'd see if you started reading more into quantum mechanics.

203
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,400
But this superposition has a different interpretation than before, and it has to.

204
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's say you were thinking of this diagonally polarized photon kind of classically, and

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,580
you said it has an amplitude of one unit for some appropriate unit system.

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,340
That would make the hypothetical amplitudes of its horizontal and vertical components

207
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,360
each the square root of one half.

208
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,920
And like Henry said, the energy of a photon is this special constant h times its frequency.

209
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,560
And because in a classical setting energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude

210
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,000
of this wave, it's tempting to think of half of the energy as being in the horizontal component,

211
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,680
and half of it as being in the vertical component.

212
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,080
But waves of this frequency cannot have half the energy of a photon.

213
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,580
I mean, the whole novelty of quantum here is that energy comes in these discrete, indivisible

214
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,040
chunks.

215
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,080
So these components, with an imagined amplitude of one over the square root of two, could

216
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,560
not exist in isolation.

217
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,440
And you might wonder what exactly they mean.

218
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,480
Well, let's get experimental about it.

219
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,000
If you were to take a vertically oriented polarizing filter and shoot this diagonally

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,240
polarized photon right at it, what do you think would happen?

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,160
Classically, the way you'd interpret this superposition is that the half of its energy

222
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
in the horizontal direction would be absorbed.

223
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,500
But because energy comes in these discrete photon packets, it either has to pass through

224
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,060
with all of its energy or get absorbed entirely.

225
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,320
And if you actually did this experiment, about half the time the photon goes through entirely,

226
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,080
and about half the time it gets absorbed entirely.

227
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,740
And it appears to be random whether a given photon passes through or not.

228
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,740
If it does pass through, forcing it to make a decision like this actually changes it so

229
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,100
that its polarization is oriented along the filter's direction.

230
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,460
This is analogous to the classic Schrodinger's cat setup.

231
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,820
You have something that's in a superposition of two states, but once you make a measurement

232
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,920
of that superposition, forcing it to interact with an observer in a way where each of those

233
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,960
two states would behave differently, from the perspective of that observer, this superposition

234
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,860
collapses to be entirely in one state or entirely in another, dead or alive, horizontal or vertical.

235
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,740
One pretty neat way to see this in action, which Henry and I talk about in the other

236
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,680
video, is to take several polarized sunglasses, or some other form of polarizing filters,

237
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,320
and start by holding two of them between you and some light source.

238
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,500
If you rotate them to be 90 degrees off from each other, the light source is blacked out

239
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,220
completely, or at least with perfect filters it would be, because all of the photons passing

240
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,540
through that first one are polarized vertically, so they actually have a 0% chance of passing

241
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,440
a filter oriented horizontally.

242
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,540
But if you insert a third filter oriented at a 45 degree angle between the two, it actually

243
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,020
lets more light through.

244
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,460
What's going on here is that 50% of the photons passing that vertical filter will

245
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,320
also pass through the diagonal filter, and once they do, they're going to be changed

246
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,180
to have a purely diagonal polarization, and once they're in that state, they have a

247
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,220
50-50 chance of passing through the filter oriented at 90 degrees.

248
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,380
So even though 0% of the photons passing through the first would pass through that last if

249
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,360
nothing was in between, by introducing another filter, 25% of them now pass through all three.

250
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,720
Now that's something you could not explain unless that middle filter forces the photons

251
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,820
to change their states.

252
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,960
And that experiment, by the way, becomes all the weirder when you dig into the specific

253
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,140
probabilities for angles between 0 and 45 degrees, and that's actually what we talk

254
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,360
about in the other video.

255
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,160
For example, one specific value we focus on there is the probability that a photon whose

256
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,220
polarization is 22.5 degrees off the direction of a filter will pass through that filter.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Again, it's helpful to think of this wave as having an amplitude of 1, and then you'd

258
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,720
think of the horizontal component as having an amplitude sin of 22.5 degrees, which is

259
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,380
around 0.38, and the vertical component would have an amplitude cos of 22.5 degrees, which

260
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,740
is around 0.92.

261
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,860
Classically, you might think of its horizontal component as having energy proportional to

262
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,580
0.38 squared, which is around 0.15. Likewise, you might think of the vertical component

263
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,400
as having an energy proportional to 0.92 squared, which comes out to be around 0.85.

264
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,020
And like we said before, classically, this would mean if you pass it through a vertical

265
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,600
filter, 15% of its energy is absorbed in the horizontal direction.

266
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,900
But because the energy of light comes in these discrete quanta that cannot be subdivided,

267
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,240
instead what you observe is that 85% of the time the photon passes through entirely, and

268
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,980
15% of the time it gets completely blocked.

269
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,280
Now I want to emphasize that the wave equations don't change. The photon is still described

270
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,800
as a superposition of two oscillating components, each with some phase and amplitude, and these

271
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,880
are often encoded using a single complex number. The difference is that classically the squares

272
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,300
of the amplitudes of each component tells you the amount of that wave's energy in

273
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,980
each direction, but with quantized light at this minimal non-zero energy level, the squares

274
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,680
of those amplitudes tell you the probabilities that a given photon is going to be found to

275
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,820
have all of its energy in one direction or not.

276
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,560
Also, these components could still have some kind of phase difference. Just like with classical

277
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,980
waves, photons can be circularly polarized, and there exist polarizing filters that only

278
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,780
let through photons that are polarized circularly, say in the clockwise direction. Or rather,

279
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,800
they let through all photons probabilistically, where the probabilities are determined by

280
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,860
describing each one of those photons as a superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise

281
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,060
states, and then the square of the amplitude of the clockwise component gives you the desired

282
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,680
probability.

283
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,560
Photons are, of course, just one quantum phenomenon, one where we initially understood it as a

284
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,700
wave thanks to Maxwell's equations, and then as individual particles or quanta, hence

285
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,380
the name quantum mechanics. But as many of you well know, there's a flip side to this

286
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,100
where many things that were understood to come in discrete little packets, like electrons,

287
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,020
were discovered to be governed by similar, wavy quantum mechanics. In cases way more

288
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,480
general than this one-photon polarization example, quantum mechanical states are described

289
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,780
as some superposition of multiple base states, and the superposition depends on what basis

290
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,940
you choose. Each component in this superposition is given with an amplitude and a phase, often

291
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,460
encoded as a single complex number, and the need for this phase arises from the wave nature

292
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,180
of these objects. As with the photon example, the choice of how to measure these objects

293
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,800
can determine a set of base states, where the probability of measuring a particle to

294
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,740
be in one of these base states is proportional to the squares of the amplitudes of these

295
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,100
numbers. It's funny to think, though, that if the wavy nature of electrons and other

296
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,020
particles was discovered first, we might instead refer to the whole subject as harmonic mechanics,

297
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,040
or something like that, since the weirdness there is not that waves come in discrete units,

298
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,640
but that particles are governed by wave equations.

This video was supported in part by Brilliant, and as viewers of this channel know, what

300
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,260
I like about Brilliant is that they're a great complement to passively watching educational

301
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,740
videos. All of you here want to learn more math, or physics, or the math that prepares

302
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,380
you for physics, and the only way to actually learn this stuff is to actively grapple with

303
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,820
puzzles and problem solving. Brilliant offers many well-curated sequences of problems that

304
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,360
help you to master all sorts of technical subjects. You all like physics, clearly, so

305
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,500
I think you would enjoy their courses on classical mechanics and gravitational physics, and honestly

306
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,200
group theory would give you a really good foundation. But there are many other great

307
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,520
courses too, especially in math. If you go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b, that one lets

308
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,820
them know that you came from here, and also the first 200 people that go to that link

309
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,820
are going to get 20% off the annual Brilliant Premium subscription. That's the subscription

310
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,680
I've been using, and it's actually really fun to have a bank of these puzzles and problems.

311
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,920
But of course, for those of you who want some more passive viewing, don't forget that

312
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,820
Henry and I just put out a video on Bell's inequalities over on minute physics. If for

313
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,260
some reason you haven't been following minute physics these days, and I don't know why

314
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,720
you wouldn't have been, the videos there have been really top notch, so definitely

315
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,800
take a moment to poke around the rest of his channel.
