00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
You guys know Henry from MinutePhysics, right?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,403
Well, he and I just made a video on a certain quantum mechanical topic, 

3
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:09,360
Bell's inequalities.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,135
It's a really mind-warping topic that not enough people know about, 

5
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:17,206
and even though it's a quantum thing, it's based on some surprisingly simple math, 

6
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,120
and you should definitely check it out.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,028
For this video, we have in mind those viewers who 

8
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,520
actually want to learn some quantum mechanics more deeply.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,918
And obviously it's a huge topic, nowhere near the scope of a single video, 

10
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:32,916
but the question we asked was what topic could we present that's not meant 

11
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,688
to be some eye-catching piece of quantum weirdness, 

12
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:39,633
but which actually lays down some useful foundations for anyone who wants 

13
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:40,700
to learn this field?

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,207
What topic would set the right intuitions for someone before they dove into, 

15
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:46,520
say, the Feynman lectures?

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,540
Well, a natural place to start, where quantum mechanics itself started, is light.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,580
Specifically, if you want to learn quantum, you have to have an 

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,280
understanding of waves and how they're described mathematically.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,710
And what we'd like to build to here is the relationship between the energy 

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,860
in a purely classical wave and the probabilities that govern quantum behavior.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,287
In fact, we'll actually spend most of the time talking through the pre-quantum 

22
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:13,920
understanding of light, since that sets up a lot of the relevant wave mechanics.

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,942
The thing is, a lot of ideas from quantum mechanics, 

24
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:20,606
like describing states as superpositions with various amplitudes and phases, 

25
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:24,555
come up in the context of classical waves in a way that doesn't involve any of the 

26
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:26,840
quantum weirdness people might be familiar with.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,634
This also helps to appreciate what's actually different in quantum mechanics, 

28
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:33,743
namely certain restrictions on how much energy these waves can have, 

29
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:36,312
how they behave when measured, and quantum entanglement, 

30
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,520
though we won't cover entanglement in this video.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,739
So we'll start with the late 1800s understanding 

32
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:44,520
of light as waves in the electromagnetic field.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
Here, let's break that down a bit.

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,520
The electric field is a vector field, and that means every point in space has 

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,520
some arrow attached to it, indicating the direction and strength of the field.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,311
Now, the physical meaning of those arrows is that if you have some charged particle in 

37
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:03,233
space, there's going to be a force on that particle in the direction of the arrow, 

38
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,440
and it's proportional to the length of the arrow and the specific charge of the particle.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,138
Likewise, the magnetic field is another vector field, 

40
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:15,431
where now the physical meaning of each arrow is that when a charged particle is 

41
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:19,779
moving through that space, there's going to be a force perpendicular to both its 

42
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:23,214
direction of motion and to the direction of the magnetic field, 

43
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:27,400
and the strength of that force is proportional to the charge of the particle, 

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,460
its velocity, and the length of the magnetic field arrow.

45
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,142
For example, a wire with a current of moving charges next to 

46
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:37,220
a magnet is either pushed or pulled by that magnetic field.

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,021
A kind of culmination of the 19th century physics understanding of 

48
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,549
how these two fields work are Maxwell's equations, 

49
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:46,969
which among other things describe how each of these fields can cause 

50
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,060
a change to the other.

51
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,668
Specifically, what Maxwell's equations tell us is that when the electric 

52
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:55,907
field arrows seem to be forming a loop around some region, 

53
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:59,970
the magnetic field will be increasing inside that region perpendicular to 

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,143
the plane of the loop, and symmetrically, such a loop in the magnetic field 

55
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:08,152
corresponds to a change in the electric field within it perpendicular to 

56
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,360
the plane of the loop.

57
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,087
Now, the specifics for how exactly these equations work is really beautiful 

58
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:18,114
and worth a full video on its own, but all you need to know for now is that 

59
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:22,194
one natural consequence of this mutual interplay in how changes to one field 

60
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:26,221
cause changes to the other in its neighboring regions is that you get these 

61
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:30,407
propagating waves where the electric field and magnetic fields are oscillating 

62
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:34,540
perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,836
When you hear the term electromagnetic radiation, 

64
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:41,041
which refers to things like radio waves and visible light, 

65
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,464
this is what it's talking about, propagating waves in both the 

66
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:46,040
electric and magnetic fields.

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,969
Of course, it's now almost mainstream to know of light as electromagnetic radiation, 

68
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,529
but it's neat to think about just how surprising this was in Maxwell's time, 

69
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:58,598
that these fields that have to do with forces on charged particles and magnets not only 

70
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,620
have something to do with light, but that what light is is a propagating wave as these 

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,457
two fields dance with each other causing this mutual oscillation of increasing and 

72
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:07,660
decreasing field strength.

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,600
With this as a visual, let's take a moment to lay down the math used to describe waves.

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,403
It'll still be purely classical, but ideas that are core to quantum mechanics, 

75
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:21,592
like superposition, amplitudes, phases, all of these come up in this context, 

76
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:25,460
and I would argue with a clearer motivation for what they actually mean.

77
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,280
Take this wave and think of it as directed straight out of the screen, towards your face.

78
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,525
And let's go ahead and ignore the magnetic field right now, 

79
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,680
just looking at how the electric field oscillates.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,505
And also, we're only going to focus on one of these vectors oscillating 

81
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,960
in the plane of the screen, which we'll think of as the xy plane.

82
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,320
If it oscillates horizontally, like this, we say that the light is horizontally polarized.

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,395
So the y component of this electric field is 0 at all times, 

84
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:58,913
and we might write the x component as something like cosine of 2 pi times ft, 

85
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:02,380
where f represents some frequency, and t is time.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,489
So if f was 1, for example, that means it takes exactly 1 

87
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:10,040
second for this cosine function to go through a full cycle.

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,076
For a lower frequency, that would mean it takes more 

89
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,440
time for the cosine to go through its full cycle.

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,400
As the value t increases, the inside of this cosine function increases more slowly.

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,727
Also we're going to include another term in here, phi, called the phase shift, 

92
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:32,400
which tells us where this vector is in its cycle at time t equals 0.

93
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,480
You'll see why that matters in just a moment.

94
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,914
By default, cosine only oscillates between negative 1 and 1, 

95
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:43,760
so let's put another term in front, a, that gives us the amplitude of this wave.

96
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,038
One more thing, just to make things look a little more like they often do in 

97
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,272
quantum mechanics, instead of writing it as a column vector, like this, 

98
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:54,821
I'm going to separate it out into two different components using these symbols 

99
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,360
called kets.

100
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,176
This ket here indicates a unit vector in the horizontal direction, 

101
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:04,580
and this ket here represents a unit vector in the vertical direction.

102
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,867
If the light is vertically polarized, meaning the electric field is 

103
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:15,546
wiggling purely in the up and down direction, its equation might look like this, 

104
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:19,474
where the horizontal component is now 0, and the vertical component 

105
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:22,940
is a cosine with some frequency, amplitude, and phase shift.

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,253
Now if you have two distinct waves, two ways of wiggling through 

107
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,921
space over time that solve Maxwell's equations, 

108
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:34,480
then adding both of these together gives another valid wave, at least in a vacuum.

109
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,020
That is, at each point in time, add these two vectors tip to tail to get a new vector.

110
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,258
Doing this at all points in space and all points in time gives a new, 

111
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:48,260
valid solution to Maxwell's equations, at least this is all true in a vacuum.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,060
This is because Maxwell's equations in a vacuum are what's called linear equations.

113
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,526
They're essentially a combination of derivatives acting on the electric and magnetic 

114
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:03,415
fields to give 0, so if one field f1 satisfies this equation and another field f2 

115
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:08,780
satisfies it, then their sum, f1 plus f2, also satisfies it, since derivatives are linear.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,004
So the sum of two or more solutions to Maxwell's 

117
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:14,980
equations is also a solution to Maxwell's equations.

118
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,540
This new wave is called a superposition of the first two.

119
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,231
And here, superposition essentially just means sum, or in some context, weighted sum, 

120
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:29,880
since if you include some kind of amplitude and phase shift in each of these components, 

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,380
it can still be called a superposition of the two original vectors.

122
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,165
Now right now, the resulting superposition is a wave wiggling in the diagonal direction, 

123
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:43,592
but if the horizontal and vertical components were out of phase with each other, 

124
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:47,255
which might happen if you increase the phase shift in one of them, 

125
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,316
their sum might instead trace out some sort of ellipse, 

126
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:54,962
and in the case where the phases are exactly 90 degrees out of sync with each other, 

127
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:59,500
and the amplitudes are both equal, this is what we call circularly polarized light.

128
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,686
This by the way is why it's important to keep track not just of the amplitude in 

129
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:09,360
each direction but also of the phase, it affects the way the two waves add together.

130
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,256
That's also an important idea that carries over to quantum, 

131
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:17,940
and underlies some of the things that look confusing at first.

132
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,992
And here's another important idea, we're describing waves by adding 

133
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:24,349
together the horizontal and vertical components, 

134
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,440
but we could also choose to describe everything with respect to different directions.

135
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,002
I mean, you could describe waves as some superposition 

136
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,659
of the diagonal and the anti-diagonal directions.

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,331
In that case, vertically polarized light would actually be a 

138
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:41,258
superposition of these two diagonal wiggling directions, 

139
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:45,160
at least when both are in phase with each other and have the same magnitude.

140
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,285
The choice of which directions you write things in terms of is called a basis, 

141
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:53,282
and which basis is nicest to work with, well that typically 

142
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,480
depends on what you're doing with the light.

143
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,646
For example, if you have a polarizing filter, like that from a set 

144
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:03,244
of polarized sunglasses, the way these work is by absorbing the 

145
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:07,180
energy from electromagnetic oscillations in some particular direction.

146
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,932
A vertically oriented polarizer, for example, would absorb 

147
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:14,450
all of the energy from these waves along the horizontal directions, 

148
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,400
at least classically that's how you might think about it.

149
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,498
So, if you're analyzing light and it's passing through a filter like this, 

150
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:25,400
it's nice to describe it with respect to the horizontal and vertical directions.

151
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,435
That way, what you can say is that whatever light passes through 

152
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,900
the filter is just the vertical component of the original wave.

153
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,477
But if you had a filter oriented, say, diagonally, 

154
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:43,176
well then it would be convenient to describe things as a superposition 

155
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:46,980
of that diagonal direction and its perpendicular anti-diagonal direction.

156
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,200
These ideas will carry over almost word for word to the quantum case.

157
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,957
Quantum states, much like this wiggling direction of our wave, 

158
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:59,828
are described as a superposition of multiple base states, 

159
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:02,600
where you have many choices for what base states to use.

160
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,719
And just like with classical waves, the components of such a 

161
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,640
superposition will have both an amplitude and a phase of some kind.

162
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,417
And by the way, for those of you who do read more into quantum mechanics, 

163
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:15,934
you'll find that these components are actually given using a single complex number, 

164
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:17,860
rather than a cosine expression like this one.

165
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,930
One way to think of this is that complex numbers are just a very convenient and 

166
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,540
natural mathematical way to encode an amplitude and a phase with a single value.

167
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,770
That can make things a little confusing because it's hard to visualize a pair of 

168
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,280
complex numbers, which is what would describe a superposition of two base states.

169
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,447
But you can think about the use of complex numbers throughout 

170
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,151
quantum mechanics as a result of its underlying wavy nature, 

171
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:42,520
and this need to encapsulate the amplitude and the phase for each direction.

172
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,260
Okay, just one quick point before getting into the quantum.

173
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,966
Look at one of these waves, and focus just on 

174
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,220
the electric field portion like we were before.

175
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,481
Classically, we think about the energy of a wave like 

176
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,340
this as being proportional to the square of its amplitude.

177
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,280
And I want you to notice how well this lines up with the Pythagorean theorem.

178
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,707
If you were to describe this wave as a superposition of a horizontal 

179
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:11,750
component with amplitude Ax, and a vertical component with amplitude Ay, 

180
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,620
then its energy density is proportional to Ax2 plus Ay2.

181
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,060
And you can think of this in two different ways.

182
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,132
Either it's because you're adding up the energies of each component in the superposition, 

183
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:26,852
or it's just that you're figuring out the new amplitude using the 

184
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,220
Pythagorean theorem and taking the square.

185
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,400
Isn't that nice?

186
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,880
In the classical understanding of light, you should be able to dial this energy 

187
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,500
up and down continuously however you want by changing the amplitude of the wave.

188
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,141
But what physicists started to notice in the late 19th and early 20th 

189
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:45,800
centuries was that this energy actually seems to come in discrete amounts.

190
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,032
Specifically, the energy of one of these electromagnetic waves always seems to 

191
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:53,980
come as an integer multiple of a specific constant times the frequency of that wave.

192
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,600
We now call this constant Planck's constant, commonly denoting it with the letter h.

193
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,241
Physically what this means is that whenever this wave trades its 

194
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:05,350
energy with something else like an electron, the amount of energy 

195
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,600
it trades off is always an integer multiple of h times its frequency.

196
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,458
Importantly, this means there is some minimal non-zero 

197
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,180
energy level for waves of a given frequency, hf.

198
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,819
If you have an electromagnetic wave with this frequency and energy, 

199
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,700
you cannot make it smaller without eliminating it entirely.

200
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,536
That feels weird when the conception of a wave 

201
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,760
is a nice continuously oscillating vector field.

202
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,464
But that's not how the universe works as late 19th 

203
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:31,880
and early 20th century experiments started to expose.

204
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,340
In fact I've done a video about this called the origin of quantum mechanics.

205
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,343
However, it's worth noting that this phenomenon is actually 

206
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,131
common in waves when they're constrained in certain ways, 

207
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,160
like in pipes or instrument strings, and it's called harmonics.

208
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,046
What's weird is that electromagnetic waves do this in free space, 

209
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:50,780
even when they're not constrained.

210
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,020
And what do we call an electromagnetic wave with this minimal possible energy?

211
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,100
A photon.

212
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,858
But like I said, the math used to describe classical 

213
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,140
electromagnetic waves carries over to describing a photon.

214
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,633
It might have, say, a 45 degree diagonal polarization, 

215
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:10,420
which can be described as a superposition of a purely horizontal state 

216
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,313
and a purely vertical state, where each one of these components has some 

217
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:15,380
amplitude and phase.

218
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,909
And with a different choice in basis, that same state might 

219
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:21,420
be described as a superposition of two other directions.

220
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,800
All of this is stuff you'd see if you started reading more into quantum mechanics.

221
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,400
But this superposition has a different interpretation than before, and it has to.

222
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,895
Let's say you were thinking of this diagonally polarized photon kind of classically, 

223
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:39,580
and you said it has an amplitude of one unit for some appropriate unit system.

224
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,371
That would make the hypothetical amplitudes of its horizontal 

225
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:46,360
and vertical components each the square root of one half.

226
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,647
And like Henry said, the energy of a photon is 

227
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,920
this special constant h times its frequency.

228
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,643
And because in a classical setting energy is proportional to the square of the 

229
00:13:56,643 --> 00:14:00,636
amplitude of this wave, it's tempting to think of half of the energy as being 

230
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:04,680
in the horizontal component, and half of it as being in the vertical component.

231
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,080
But waves of this frequency cannot have half the energy of a photon.

232
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,058
I mean, the whole novelty of quantum here is that energy comes in these discrete, 

233
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,040
indivisible chunks.

234
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,035
So these components, with an imagined amplitude of one over the square root of two, 

235
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,560
could not exist in isolation.

236
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,440
And you might wonder what exactly they mean.

237
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,480
Well, let's get experimental about it.

238
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,145
If you were to take a vertically oriented polarizing filter and shoot this 

239
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:36,240
diagonally polarized photon right at it, what do you think would happen?

240
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,052
Classically, the way you'd interpret this superposition is that 

241
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:44,560
the half of its energy in the horizontal direction would be absorbed.

242
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,097
But because energy comes in these discrete photon packets, 

243
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:52,060
it either has to pass through with all of its energy or get absorbed entirely.

244
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,284
And if you actually did this experiment, about half the time the photon 

245
00:14:56,284 --> 00:15:00,080
goes through entirely, and about half the time it gets absorbed entirely.

246
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,740
And it appears to be random whether a given photon passes through or not.

247
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,847
If it does pass through, forcing it to make a decision like this actually 

248
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:14,100
changes it so that its polarization is oriented along the filter's direction.

249
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,460
This is analogous to the classic Schrodinger's cat setup.

250
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,083
You have something that's in a superposition of two states, 

251
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,148
but once you make a measurement of that superposition, 

252
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:28,216
forcing it to interact with an observer in a way where each of those two 

253
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:32,228
states would behave differently, from the perspective of that observer, 

254
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:36,742
this superposition collapses to be entirely in one state or entirely in another, 

255
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,860
dead or alive, horizontal or vertical.

256
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,143
One pretty neat way to see this in action, which Henry and I talk about in the 

257
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,851
other video, is to take several polarized sunglasses, 

258
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:51,015
or some other form of polarizing filters, and start by holding two of them between 

259
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,320
you and some light source.

260
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,905
If you rotate them to be 90 degrees off from each other, 

261
00:15:55,905 --> 00:16:00,778
the light source is blacked out completely, or at least with perfect filters it would be, 

262
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:05,325
because all of the photons passing through that first one are polarized vertically, 

263
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:09,440
so they actually have a 0% chance of passing a filter oriented horizontally.

264
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,617
But if you insert a third filter oriented at a 45 degree angle between the two, 

265
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:18,020
it actually lets more light through.

266
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,153
What's going on here is that 50% of the photons passing that vertical filter 

267
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:26,787
will also pass through the diagonal filter, and once they do, 

268
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:30,772
they're going to be changed to have a purely diagonal polarization, 

269
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:35,461
and once they're in that state, they have a 50-50 chance of passing through the 

270
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,220
filter oriented at 90 degrees.

271
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,086
So even though 0% of the photons passing through the first 

272
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:44,318
would pass through that last if nothing was in between, 

273
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,360
by introducing another filter, 25% of them now pass through all three.

274
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,914
Now that's something you could not explain unless that 

275
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:54,820
middle filter forces the photons to change their states.

276
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,271
And that experiment, by the way, becomes all the weirder when you 

277
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:03,221
dig into the specific probabilities for angles between 0 and 45 degrees, 

278
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:06,359
and that's actually what we talk about in the other video.

279
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,099
For example, one specific value we focus on there is the probability that a photon whose 

280
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:19,220
polarization is 22.5 degrees off the direction of a filter will pass through that filter.

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,514
Again, it's helpful to think of this wave as having an amplitude of 1, 

282
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:29,092
and then you'd think of the horizontal component as having an amplitude 

283
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:33,543
sin of 22.5 degrees, which is around 0.38, and the vertical component 

284
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:37,740
would have an amplitude cos of 22.5 degrees, which is around 0.92.

285
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,050
Classically, you might think of its horizontal component as 

286
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,200
having energy proportional to 0.38 squared, which is around 0.15.

287
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,836
Likewise, you might think of the vertical component as having an energy proportional to 0.

288
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,400
92 squared, which comes out to be around 0.85.

289
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,370
And like we said before, classically, this would mean if you pass it through 

290
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,600
a vertical filter, 15% of its energy is absorbed in the horizontal direction.

291
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,822
But because the energy of light comes in these discrete quanta that cannot be subdivided, 

292
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:18,075
instead what you observe is that 85% of the time the photon passes through entirely, 

293
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,980
and 15% of the time it gets completely blocked.

294
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,760
Now I want to emphasize that the wave equations don't change.

295
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,223
The photon is still described as a superposition of two oscillating components, 

296
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:37,773
each with some phase and amplitude, and these are often encoded using a single complex 

297
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:38,140
number.

298
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,612
The difference is that classically the squares of the amplitudes of each component tells 

299
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:46,766
you the amount of that wave's energy in each direction, 

300
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:50,371
but with quantized light at this minimal non-zero energy level, 

301
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:55,327
the squares of those amplitudes tell you the probabilities that a given photon is going 

302
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:58,820
to be found to have all of its energy in one direction or not.

303
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,260
Also, these components could still have some kind of phase difference.

304
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,489
Just like with classical waves, photons can be circularly polarized, 

305
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:10,077
and there exist polarizing filters that only let through photons 

306
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:13,500
that are polarized circularly, say in the clockwise direction.

307
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,365
Or rather, they let through all photons probabilistically, 

308
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:21,272
where the probabilities are determined by describing each one of those 

309
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:25,288
photons as a superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise states, 

310
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:29,359
and then the square of the amplitude of the clockwise component gives you 

311
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,680
the desired probability.

312
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,597
Photons are, of course, just one quantum phenomenon, 

313
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:38,332
one where we initially understood it as a wave thanks to Maxwell's equations, 

314
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:42,020
and then as individual particles or quanta, hence the name quantum mechanics.

315
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,931
But as many of you well know, there's a flip side to this where many 

316
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:48,688
things that were understood to come in discrete little packets, 

317
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,220
like electrons, were discovered to be governed by similar, wavy quantum mechanics.

318
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,286
In cases way more general than this one-photon polarization example, 

319
00:19:56,286 --> 00:20:00,632
quantum mechanical states are described as some superposition of multiple base states, 

320
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,380
and the superposition depends on what basis you choose.

321
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,737
Each component in this superposition is given with an amplitude and a phase, 

322
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:10,911
often encoded as a single complex number, and the need for this 

323
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:13,440
phase arises from the wave nature of these objects.

324
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,776
As with the photon example, the choice of how to measure these objects can determine 

325
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:21,488
a set of base states, where the probability of measuring a particle to be in one of 

326
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:25,200
these base states is proportional to the squares of the amplitudes of these numbers.

327
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,357
It's funny to think, though, that if the wavy nature of electrons and other 

328
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:33,056
particles was discovered first, we might instead refer to the whole subject as 

329
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:36,660
harmonic mechanics, or something like that, since the weirdness there is not 

330
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,640
that waves come in discrete units, but that particles are governed by wave equations.

331
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,905
This video was supported in part by Brilliant, 

332
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:48,065
and as viewers of this channel know, what I like about Brilliant 

333
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:51,760
is that they're a great complement to passively watching educational videos.

334
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,163
All of you here want to learn more math, or physics, 

335
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:58,472
or the math that prepares you for physics, and the only way to 

336
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:02,780
actually learn this stuff is to actively grapple with puzzles and problem solving.

337
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,324
Brilliant offers many well-curated sequences of problems 

338
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:09,100
that help you to master all sorts of technical subjects.

339
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,662
You all like physics, clearly, so I think you would enjoy their 

340
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,402
courses on classical mechanics and gravitational physics, 

341
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:18,520
and honestly group theory would give you a really good foundation.

342
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,980
But there are many other great courses too, especially in math.

343
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,196
If you go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b, that one lets them know that you came from here, 

344
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:32,336
and also the first 200 people that go to that link are going to get 

345
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:35,380
20% off the annual Brilliant Premium subscription.

346
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,440
That's the subscription I've been using, and it's actually 

347
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,680
really fun to have a bank of these puzzles and problems.

348
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,561
But of course, for those of you who want some more passive viewing, 

349
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:48,060
don't forget that Henry and I just put out a video on Bell's inequalities over on 

350
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,700
minute physics.

351
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,342
If for some reason you haven't been following minute physics these days, 

352
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:55,872
and I don't know why you wouldn't have been, the videos there have been really top notch, 

353
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:58,500
so definitely take a moment to poke around the rest of his channel.
