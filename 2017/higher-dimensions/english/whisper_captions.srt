1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,720
Math is sometimes a real tease. It seduces us with the beauty of reasoning

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,100
geometrically in two and three dimensions where there's this really

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,940
nice back and forth between pairs or triplets of numbers and spatial stuff

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,240
that our visual cortex is good at processing. For example, if you think

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,900
about a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin, you are in effect

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,980
conceptualizing every possible pair of numbers x and y that satisfy a

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,980
certain numerical property that x squared plus y squared is 1. And the usefulness here is that a lot of

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,540
facts that look opaque in a purely analytic context become quite clear

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,700
geometrically and vice versa. Honestly, this channel has been the direct

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,540
beneficiary of this back and forth since it offers such a rich library of that

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,560
special category of cleverness that involves connecting two seemingly

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,900
disparate ideas. And I don't just mean the general back and forth between pairs

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,660
or triplets of numbers and spatial reasoning. I mean this specific one

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,200
between sums of squares and circles and spheres. It's at the heart of the video

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,640
I made showing how pi is connected to number theory and primes and the one

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,140
showing how to visualize all possible Pythagorean triples. It also underlies

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,520
the video on the Borsuk-Ulam theorem being used to solve what was basically a

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,360
counting puzzle by using topological facts about spheres. There is no doubt

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,820
that the ability to frame analytic facts geometrically is very useful for

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,960
math. But it's all a tease because when you start asking questions about

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,420
quadruplets or quintuplets or 100 tuples of numbers it's frustrating. The

22
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,020
constraints on our physical space seem to have constrained our intuitions about

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,500
geometry and we lose this back and forth. I mean it is completely reasonable to

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,440
imagine that there are problems out there that would have clever and

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,440
illuminating solutions if only we knew how to conceptualize say lists of 10

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,840
numbers as individual points in some space. For mathematicians or computer

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,980
scientists or physicists problems that are framed in terms of lists of numbers

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,980
lists of more than three numbers are a regular part of the job and the standard

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,260
approach to actually doing math in higher dimensions is to use two and

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,720
three dimensions for analogy but to fundamentally reason about things just

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,160
analytically somewhat analogous to a pilot relying primarily on instruments

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,680
and not sight while flying through the clouds. Now what I want to offer here is

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,240
a hybrid between the purely geometric and the purely analytic views a method

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,100
for making the analytic reasoning a little more visual in a way that

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,280
generalizes to arbitrarily high dimensions and to drive home the value

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,460
of a tactic like this I want to share with you a very famous example where

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,380
analogies with two and three dimensions cannot help because of something

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,180
extremely counterintuitive that only happens in higher dimensions. The hope

39
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,200
though is that what I show you here helps to make that phenomenon more

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,540
intuitive. The focus throughout will be on higher dimensional spheres for

41
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,260
example when we talk about a four-dimensional sphere say with radius

42
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,120
one centered at the origin what that actually is is the set of all

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,180
quadruplets of numbers xyzw where the sum of the squares of these numbers is

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,200
one. What I have pictured here now is multiple three-dimensional slices of a

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,080
4d sphere projected back into three dimensions but it's confusing and even

46
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,720
if you do wrap your head around it it just pushes the question back to how you

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,020
would think about a five or six or a seven dimensional sphere and more

48
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,360
importantly squinting your eyes to understand a projection like this is not

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,160
very reflective of what doing math with a 4d sphere actually entails. Instead

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,580
the basic idea here will be to get very literal about it and to think about four

51
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,340
separate numbers. I like to picture four vertical number lines with sliders to

52
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,720
represent each number. Each configuration of these sliders is a point in 4d space, a

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
quadruplet of numbers, and what it means to be on a 4d unit sphere centered at

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,180
the origin is that the sum of the squares of these four values is one. Our

55
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,560
goal is to understand which movements of these sliders correspond to movements

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,880
on the sphere. To do that it helps if we knock things down to two dimensions

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,680
where we can actually see the circle. So ask yourself what's a nice way to think

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,800
about this relation that x squared plus y squared is one? Well I like to think of

59
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,280
the value of x squared as the real estate belonging to x and likewise the

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,500
value of y squared is the real estate belonging to y and that they have a

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,980
total of one unit of real estate to share between them. So moving around on

62
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,660
the circle corresponds to a constant exchange of real estate between the two

63
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,200
variables. Part of the reason I choose this term is that it lets us make a very

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,500
useful analogy that real estate is cheap near zero and more expensive away from

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,280
To see this, consider starting off in a position where x equals 1 and y is 0,

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,840
meaning x has all of the real estate to itself, which in our usual geometric

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,280
picture means we're on the rightmost point of the circle. If you move x down

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:29,240
just a bit to 0.9 the value of x squared changes to 0.81, so it has in effect

69
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,840
given up 0.19 units of real estate. But for y squared to increase by that same

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,060
amount, y has to move an entire 0.44 units away from 0, more than four times

71
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,000
the amount that x moved. In other words, x changed a little to give up expensive

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,500
real estate so that y could move a lot and gain the same value of cheap real

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,180
estate. In terms of the usual circle drawing, this corresponds to the steep

74
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,640
slope near the right side. A small nudge in x allows for a very big change to y.

75
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,360
Moving forward, let's add some tick marks to these lines to indicate what 0.05

76
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,180
units of real estate looks like at each point. That is, how much would x have to

77
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,740
change so that the value of x squared changes by 0.05? As you walk around the

78
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,420
circle, the trade-off in value between x squared and y squared gives this piston

79
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,900
looking dance motion, where the sliders are moving more slowly away from zero

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,420
because real estate is more expensive in those regions. There are just more tick

81
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,660
marks to cover per unit distance. Also, a nice side effect of the term real estate

82
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,920
is that it aligns naturally with the fact that it comes in units of distance

83
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,220
squared, so the square root of the total real estate among all coordinates gives

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,200
us the distance from the origin. For a unit sphere in three dimensions, the set

85
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,700
of all triplets x, y, z where the sum of their squares is one, all we have to do

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,520
is add a third slider for z, but these three sliders still only have the one

87
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,540
unit of real estate to share between them. To get a feel for this, imagine

88
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,320
holding x in place at 0.5, where it occupies 0.25 units of real estate. What

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,280
this means is that y and z can move around in the same piston dance motion

90
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,220
we saw before as they trade off the remaining 0.75 units of real

91
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,320
estate. In terms of our typical way of visualizing a sphere, this corresponds to

92
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,980
slicing the sphere along the plane where x is 0.5 and looking at the circle formed

93
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:39,220
by all of the choices for y and z on that sphere. As you increase the value of

94
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,280
x, the amount of real estate left over for y and z is smaller, and this more

95
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,260
constrained piston dance is what it feels like for the circular slice to be

96
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,240
smaller. Eventually, once x reaches the value 1, there's no real estate left

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,240
over, so you reach this singularity point where y and z are both forced to be 0.

98
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,140
The feeling here is a bit like being a bug on the surface of the sphere. You are

99
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,300
unable to see the whole sphere all at once. Instead, you're just sitting on a

100
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,400
single point, and you have some sense for what local movements are allowed. In four

101
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,000
dimensions and higher, we lose the crutch of the global view that a spatial

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,720
visual offers, but the fundamental rules of this real estate exchange remain the

103
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,460
same. If you fix one slider in place and watch the other three trade off, this is

104
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,740
basically what it means to take a slice of the 4d sphere to get a small 3d sphere,

105
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,240
in much the same way that fixing one of the sliders for the three-dimensional

106
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,460
case give us a circular slice when the remaining two were free to vary. Now

107
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,900
watching these sliders move about and thinking about the real estate exchange

108
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,920
is pretty fun, but it runs the risk of being aimless unless we have an actual

109
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,220
high-dimensional puzzle to sink our teeth into. So let's set aside the

110
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,280
sliders for just a moment and bring in a very classic example of something that

111
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,080
seems reasonable and even dull in two and three dimensions, but which is

112
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,900
totally out of whack in higher dimensions. To start, take a 2x2 box

113
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,680
centered at the origin. Its corners are on the vertices 1,1, 1,-1,-1,1, and

114
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,900
1,-1. Draw four circles, each with radius 1, centered at these four

115
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,300
vertices, so each one is tangent to two of its neighbors. Now I want you to think

116
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,120
of the circle centered at the origin which is just large enough to be

117
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,300
touching those corner circles, tangent to each one of them. What we want to do for

118
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,020
this setup and for its analogies in higher dimensions is find the radius of

119
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,980
that inner circle. Here in two dimensions we can use the Pythagorean

120
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,240
theorem to see that the distance from the origin to the corner of the box is

121
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,900
the square root of 2, which is around 1.414. Then you can subtract off this

122
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:10,280
portion here, the radius of the corner circle, which by definition is 1, and that

123
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,580
is 1,414. No surprises here, that seems pretty reasonable. Now do something

124
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,040
analogous in three dimensions. Draw a 2x2x2 cube whose corners have

125
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,260
vertices 1,1,1,1,1,-1, on and on and on, and then we're going to take eight

126
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,300
different spheres, each of which has a radius 1, and center them on these

127
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,140
vertices so that each one is tangent to three of its neighbors. Now again, think

128
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,660
about the sphere centered at the origin which is just large enough to be barely

129
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,880
touching those eight corner spheres. As before, we can start by thinking about

130
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,280
the distance from the origin to the corner of the box, say the corner at 1,1,1.

131
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,120
By the way, I guess I still haven't yet explicitly said that the way distances

132
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,280
work in higher dimensions is always to add up the squares of the components in

133
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,080
each direction and take the square root. If you've never seen why this follows

134
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,220
from the Pythagorean theorem just in the two-dimensional case, it's actually a

135
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,580
really fun puzzle to think about, and I've left the relevant image up on the

136
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,420
screen for any of you who want to pause and ponder on it. Anyway, in our case the

137
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,080
distance between the origin and the corner 1,1,1 is the square root of 1

138
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,820
squared plus 1 squared plus 1 squared, or square root of 3, which is about 1.73.

139
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,380
So the radius of that inner sphere is going to be this quantity minus the

140
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,720
radius of a corner sphere, which by definition is 1. And again, 0.73 seems

141
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,080
like a reasonable radius for that inner sphere. But what happens to that inner

142
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,900
radius as you increase dimensions? Obviously the reason I bring this up is

143
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,300
that something surprising will happen, and some of you might see where this is

144
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,140
going, but I actually don't want it to feel like a surprise. As fun as it is to

145
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,340
wow people with counterintuitive facts and math, the goal here is genuine

146
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,920
understanding, not shock. For higher dimensions we'll be using sliders to

147
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,440
get a gut feel for what's going on, but since it's kind of a different way of

148
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,380
viewing things it helps to get a running start by looking back at how to analyze

149
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,400
the two and three-dimensional cases in the context of sliders. First things

150
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,160
first, how do you think about a circle centered at a corner like 1,-1?

151
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,300
Well previously, for a circle centered at the origin, the amount of real estate

152
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,320
belonging to both x and y was dependent on their distance from the number 0. And

153
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,960
it's the same basic idea here as you move around the center, it's just that

154
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,280
the real estate might be dependent on the distance between each coordinate and

155
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,380
some other number. So for this circle, centered at 1,-1, the amount of

156
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,400
real estate belonging to x is the square of its distance from 1. Likewise, the real

157
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,440
estate belonging to y is the square of its distance from negative 1. Other than

158
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,380
that, the look and feel with this piston dance trade-off is completely the same.

159
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,820
For simplicity, we'll only focus on one of these circles, the one centered at 1,-1.

160
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,420
Now ask yourself, what does it mean to find a circle centered at the origin

161
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,480
large enough to be tangent to this guy when we're thinking just in terms of

162
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,870
sliders? Well notice how this point of tangency happens when the x and y

163
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,930
coordinates are both the same. Or phrased differently, at the point of this corner

164
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,590
circle closest to the origin, the real estate is shared evenly between x and y.

165
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,510
This will be important for later, so let's really dig in and think about why

166
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,930
it's true. Imagine perturbing that point slightly, maybe moving x a little closer

167
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,150
to 0, which means y would have to move a little away from 0. The change in x would

168
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,890
have to be a little smaller than the change in y, since the real estate it

169
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,230
gains by moving farther away from 1 is more expensive than the real estate that

170
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,170
y loses by getting closer to 1. But from the perspective of the origin point 0,0

171
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:09,270
that trade-off is reversed. The resulting change to x squared is smaller than the

172
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,150
resulting change to y squared, since when real estate is measured with respect to

173
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:21,290
0,0, that move of y towards 1 is the more expensive one. What this means is that

174
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,830
any slight perturbation away from this point where real estate is shared evenly

175
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,430
results in an increasing distance from the origin. The reason we care is that

176
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,570
this point is tangent to the inner circle, so we can also think about it as

177
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,630
being a point of the inner circle. And this will be very useful for higher

178
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,110
dimensions. It gives us a reference point to understanding the radius of that inner

179
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,090
circle. Specifically, you can ask how much real estate is shared between x and y at

180
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,230
this point when real estate measurements are done with respect to

181
00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:01,490
the origin 0,0. For example, down here in two dimensions both x and y dip below 0.5

182
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,210
in this configuration, so the total value x squared plus y squared is going to be

183
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:13,230
less than 0.5 squared plus 0.5 squared. Comparing to this halfway point is

184
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,310
really going to come in handy for wrapping our mind around what happens in

185
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,130
higher dimensions. Taking things one step at a time, let's bump it up to three

186
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:27,710
dimensions. Consider the corner sphere with radius 1 centered at 1,1,1. The point on

187
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,890
that sphere that's closest to the origin corresponds to the configuration

188
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,290
of sliders where x, y, and z are all reaching down toward 0 and equal to each

189
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,530
other. Again, they all have to go a little beyond that halfway point because the

190
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:50,790
position 0.5 only accounts for 0.5 squared, or 0.25 units of real estate. So

191
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,910
with all three coordinates getting a third of a unit of real estate, they need

192
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,670
to be farther out. And again, since this is a point where the corner sphere is

193
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,430
tangent to the inner sphere, it's also a point of the inner sphere. So with

194
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,050
reference to the origin 0,0,0, think about the amount of real estate shared between

195
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,750
x, y, and z in this position corresponding to the tangent point. It's definitely

196
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:23,010
less than 0.75 since all three of these are smaller than 0.5, so each one has

197
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,810
less than 0.25 units of real estate. And again, we sit back and feel comfortable

198
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,770
with this result, right? The inner sphere is smaller than the corner spheres. But

199
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,750
things get interesting when we move up into four dimensions. Our 2x2x2x2

200
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:47,850
box is going to have 16 vertices at 1111, 111-1, and so on, with all

201
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,410
possible binary combinations of 1 and negative 1. What this means is that there

202
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,490
are 16 unit spheres centered at these corners, each one tangent to four of its

203
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,050
neighbors. As before, we'll just be focusing on one of them, the one centered

204
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,570
at 1111. The point of the sphere closest to the origin corresponds to the

205
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,150
configuration of sliders where all four coordinates reach exactly halfway

206
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,170
between 1 and 0. And that's because when one of the coordinates is 0.5 units away

207
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:25,830
from 1, it has 0.25 units of real estate with respect to the point 1. We do the

208
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,570
same trick as before, thinking of this now as a point of the inner sphere and

209
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,170
measuring things with respect to the origin, but you can already see what's

210
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,850
cool about four dimensions. As you switch to thinking of real estate with respect

211
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,530
to 0000, it's still the case that each of these four coordinates has 0.25 units

212
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,230
of real estate, making for a total of one shared between the four coordinates. In

213
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,290
other words, that inner sphere is precisely the same size as the corner

214
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,730
spheres. This matches with what you see numerically, by the way, where you can

215
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,710
compute the distance between the origin and the corner, 1111, is the square root

216
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,230
of 4, and then when you subtract off the radius of one of the corner spheres, what

217
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,510
you get is 1. But there's something much more satisfying about seeing it, rather

218
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,870
than just computing it. In particular, here's a cool aspect of the fact that

219
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,090
that inner sphere has radius 1. Move things around so that all of the real

220
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,790
estate goes to the coordinate x, and you'll end up at the point 1, 0, 0, 0. This

221
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,890
point is actually touching the 2x2x2x2 box, and when you're stuck

222
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,330
thinking in the two or three dimensional cases, this fact that the inner sphere

223
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,330
has radius 1, the same size as the corner spheres, and that it touches the box,

224
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,310
well it just seems too big. But it's important to realize this is

225
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,310
fundamentally a four-dimensional phenomenon, and you just can't cram it

226
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:56,270
down into smaller dimensions. But things get weirder. Let's knock it up to five

227
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,550
dimensions. In this case we have quite a few corner spheres, 32 in total, but again

228
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,650
for simplicity we'll only be thinking about the ones centered at 11111. Think

229
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,550
about the point of the sphere closest to the origin, where all five coordinates

230
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,510
are equally splitting the one unit of shared real estate. This time each

231
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:21,390
coordinate is a little higher than 0.5. If they reach down to 0.5, each one would

232
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:28,370
have 0.25 units of real estate, giving a total of 1.25, which is too much. But the

233
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,030
tables are turned when you view this as a point on the inner sphere, because with

234
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,410
respect to the origin, this configuration has much more than one unit of real

235
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:45,270
estate. Not only is every coordinate more than 0.5 units away from 0, but the larger

236
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,270
number of dimensions means that there's more total real estate when you add it

237
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,630
all up. Specifically you can compute that the radius of that inner sphere is about

238
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:00,570
1.24. The intuitive feel for what that means is that the sliders can roam over

239
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,970
more territory than what just a single unit of real estate would allow. One fun

240
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,430
way to see what this means is to adjust everything so that all of the real

241
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,690
estate goes to just one coordinate. Because this coordinate can reach beyond

242
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,970
one, what you are seeing is that this five dimensional inner sphere actually

243
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:25,830
pokes outside the box. But to really get a feel for how strange things become, as

244
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,410
a last example I want to jump up into ten dimensions. Remember, all this means

245
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,570
is that points have ten coordinates. For a sphere with radius 1, a single unit of

246
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,670
real estate must be shared among all ten of those coordinates. As always, the point

247
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,390
of this corner sphere closest to the origin is the one where all ten

248
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,590
coordinates split the real estate evenly. And here you can really see just how far

249
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,070
away this feels from the origin. Or phrased differently, that inner sphere is

250
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,310
allowed to have a very large amount of real estate. In fact, you can compute that

251
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,970
the radius of the inner sphere is about 2.16. And viewed from this perspective,

252
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,650
where you have ten full dimensions to share that real estate, doesn't it

253
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,030
actually feel somewhat reasonable that the inner sphere should have a radius

254
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,910
more than twice as big as all those corner spheres? To get a sense for just

255
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:25,010
how big this inner sphere is, look back in two dimensions and imagine a 4x4 box

256
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,250
bounding all four circles from the outside. Or go to three dimensions and

257
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,830
imagine a 4x4x4 box bounding all of those corner spheres from the outside.

258
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,410
Way up here in ten dimensions, that quote-unquote inner sphere is actually

259
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,870
large enough to poke outside of that outer bounding box, since it has a

260
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,570
diameter bigger than four.

261
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,350
I know that seems crazy, but you have to realize that the face of the box is

262
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,290
always two units away from the origin, no matter how high the dimension is. And

263
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,290
fundamentally it's because it only involves moving along a single axis. But

264
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:11,110
the point 1111111111, which determines the inner sphere's radius, is actually

265
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,510
really far away from the center, all the way up here in ten dimensions. And it's

266
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,290
because all ten of those dimensions add a full unit of real estate for that

267
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,870
point. And of course as you keep upping the dimensions, that inner sphere just

268
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,370
keeps growing without bound. Not only is it poking outside of these boxes, but the

269
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,470
proportion of the inner sphere lying inside the box decreases exponentially

270
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:43,190
towards zero as the dimension keeps increasing. So taking a step back, one of

271
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,670
the things I like about using this slider method for teaching is that when

272
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,210
I shared it with a few friends, the way they started to talk about higher

273
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,850
dimensions became a little less metaphysical and started to sound more

274
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,590
like how you would hear a mathematician talk about the topic. Rather than

275
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,950
skeptically asking whether or not ten-dimensional space is a real thing,

276
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,850
recognizing that it's exactly as real as numbers are, people would actually

277
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,870
probe at what other properties high-dimensional spheres have and what

278
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,270
other shapes feel like in terms of sliders. This box situation is just one

279
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,210
in a number of things that feel very crazy about higher dimensional spheres,

280
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,490
and it's really fun to think about these others in the context of sliders

281
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,010
and real estate. It's obviously limited, I mean you're a bug on the surface of

282
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,930
these objects, only getting a feel for one point at a time and for the rules of

283
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,610
movement. Also, geometry can be quite nice when it's coordinate-free, and this is

284
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,670
the opposite of that, but it does give a foothold into thinking about

285
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:47,130
high-dimensional shapes a little more concretely. Now you could say that

286
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,690
viewing things with sliders is no different from thinking about things

287
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,990
purely analytically. I mean, it's honestly little more than representing each

288
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,810
coordinate literally, it's kind of the most obvious thing you might do. But this

289
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,790
small move makes it much more possible to play with the thought of a

290
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,570
high-dimensional point, and even little things like thinking about the squares

291
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,650
of coordinates as real estate can shed light on some seemingly strange aspects

292
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,070
of high dimensions, like just how far away the corner of a box is from its

293
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,450
center. If anything, the fact that it's such a direct representation of a purely

294
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,750
analytic description is exactly what makes it such a faithful reflection of

295
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,050
what genuinely doing math in higher dimensions entails. We're still flying

296
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,170
in the clouds, trusting the instruments of analytic reasoning, but this is a

297
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,350
redesign of those instruments, one which better takes advantage of the fact that

298
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,170
such a large portion of our brains goes towards image processing. I mean, just

299
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,710
because you can't visualize something doesn't mean you can't still think

300
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,590
about it visually.
