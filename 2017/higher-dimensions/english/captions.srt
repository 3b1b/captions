1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,200
Math is sometimes a real tease.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,503
It seduces us with the beauty of reasoning geometrically in two and three 

3
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:14,187
dimensions where there's this really nice back and forth between pairs or 

4
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:18,320
triplets of numbers and spatial stuff that our visual cortex is good at processing.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,287
For example, if you think about a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin, 

6
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:29,368
you are in effect conceptualizing every possible pair of numbers x and y that 

7
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,060
satisfy a certain numerical property that x squared plus y squared is 1.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,111
And the usefulness here is that a lot of facts that look opaque in a 

9
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:43,380
purely analytic context become quite clear geometrically and vice versa.

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,307
Honestly, this channel has been the direct beneficiary of this back 

11
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:52,533
and forth since it offers such a rich library of that special category 

12
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:56,640
of cleverness that involves connecting two seemingly disparate ideas.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,706
And I don't just mean the general back and forth between 

14
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,860
pairs or triplets of numbers and spatial reasoning.

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,280
I mean this specific one between sums of squares and circles and spheres.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,502
It's at the heart of the video I made showing how pi is connected to number theory 

17
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:15,780
and primes and the one showing how to visualize all possible Pythagorean triples.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,576
It also underlies the video on the Borsuk-Ulam theorem being used to solve 

19
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:24,940
what was basically a counting puzzle by using topological facts about spheres.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,688
There is no doubt that the ability to frame analytic 

21
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,220
facts geometrically is very useful for math.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,562
But it's all a tease because when you start asking questions about 

23
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,520
quadruplets or quintuplets or 100 tuples of numbers it's frustrating.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,060
The constraints on our physical space seem to have constrained 

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,780
our intuitions about geometry and we lose this back and forth.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,684
I mean it is completely reasonable to imagine that there are problems out 

27
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:56,962
there that would have clever and illuminating solutions if only we knew how 

28
00:01:56,962 --> 00:02:01,240
to conceptualize say lists of 10 numbers as individual points in some space.

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,469
For mathematicians or computer scientists or physicists problems that are 

30
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,776
framed in terms of lists of numbers lists of more than three numbers are a 

31
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:15,140
regular part of the job and the standard approach to actually doing math in 

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,274
higher dimensions is to use two and three dimensions for analogy but to 

33
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:23,638
fundamentally reason about things just analytically somewhat analogous to a 

34
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:28,520
pilot relying primarily on instruments and not sight while flying through the clouds.

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,108
Now what I want to offer here is a hybrid between the purely geometric and 

36
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:37,506
the purely analytic views a method for making the analytic reasoning a little 

37
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:41,790
more visual in a way that generalizes to arbitrarily high dimensions and to 

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,019
drive home the value of a tactic like this I want to share with you a very 

39
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,135
famous example where analogies with two and three dimensions cannot help 

40
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:55,040
because of something extremely counterintuitive that only happens in higher dimensions.

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,680
The hope though is that what I show you here helps to make that phenomenon more intuitive.

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,537
The focus throughout will be on higher dimensional spheres for example 

43
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:11,162
when we talk about a four-dimensional sphere say with radius one centered 

44
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:15,474
at the origin what that actually is is the set of all quadruplets of 

45
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:19,600
numbers xyzw where the sum of the squares of these numbers is one.

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,424
What I have pictured here now is multiple three-dimensional slices of a 4d sphere 

47
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:31,048
projected back into three dimensions but it's confusing and even if you do wrap your head 

48
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:36,609
around it it just pushes the question back to how you would think about a five or six or 

49
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:41,858
a seven dimensional sphere and more importantly squinting your eyes to understand a 

50
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:47,420
projection like this is not very reflective of what doing math with a 4d sphere actually 

51
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,920
entails.

52
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,893
Instead the basic idea here will be to get very literal 

53
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:54,460
about it and to think about four separate numbers.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,400
I like to picture four vertical number lines with sliders to represent each number.

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,243
Each configuration of these sliders is a point in 4d space, 

56
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:08,848
a quadruplet of numbers, and what it means to be on a 4d unit sphere 

57
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:14,320
centered at the origin is that the sum of the squares of these four values is one.

58
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,165
Our goal is to understand which movements of these 

59
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:23,400
sliders correspond to movements on the sphere.

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,465
To do that it helps if we knock things down to 

61
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:29,640
two dimensions where we can actually see the circle.

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,538
So ask yourself what's a nice way to think about 

63
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,680
this relation that x squared plus y squared is one?

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,312
Well I like to think of the value of x squared as the real estate belonging 

65
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:46,527
to x and likewise the value of y squared is the real estate belonging to y 

66
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:50,800
and that they have a total of one unit of real estate to share between them.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,151
So moving around on the circle corresponds to a constant 

68
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,320
exchange of real estate between the two variables.

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,476
Part of the reason I choose this term is that it lets us make a very 

70
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:07,490
useful analogy that real estate is cheap near zero and more expensive 

71
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,536
away from To see this, consider starting off in a position where x equals 1 and y is 0, 

72
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:15,288
meaning x has all of the real estate to itself, 

73
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:20,220
which in our usual geometric picture means we're on the rightmost point of the circle.

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,820
If you move x down just a bit to 0.9 the value of x squared changes to 0.81, 

75
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,520
so it has in effect given up 0.19 units of real estate.

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,760
But for y squared to increase by that same amount, 

77
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,073
y has to move an entire 0.44 units away from 0, 

78
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,180
more than four times the amount that x moved.

79
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,916
In other words, x changed a little to give up expensive real estate so 

80
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,780
that y could move a lot and gain the same value of cheap real estate.

81
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,658
In terms of the usual circle drawing, this corresponds 

82
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,700
to the steep slope near the right side.

83
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,640
A small nudge in x allows for a very big change to y.

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,126
Moving forward, let's add some tick marks to these lines to 

85
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:10,120
indicate what 0.05 units of real estate looks like at each point.

86
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,460
That is, how much would x have to change so that the value of x squared changes by 0.05?

87
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,057
As you walk around the circle, the trade-off in value between x squared and y 

88
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:24,715
squared gives this piston looking dance motion, 

89
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:29,088
where the sliders are moving more slowly away from zero because real estate is 

90
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,860
more expensive in those regions.

91
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,200
There are just more tick marks to cover per unit distance.

92
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,788
Also, a nice side effect of the term real estate is that it aligns naturally 

93
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:43,079
with the fact that it comes in units of distance squared, 

94
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,561
so the square root of the total real estate among all coordinates gives us the 

95
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:48,980
distance from the origin.

96
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,428
For a unit sphere in three dimensions, the set of all triplets x, y, 

97
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:59,387
z where the sum of their squares is one, all we have to do is add a third slider for z, 

98
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:04,460
but these three sliders still only have the one unit of real estate to share between them.

99
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,258
To get a feel for this, imagine holding x in place at 0.5, 

100
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:12,300
where it occupies 0.25 units of real estate.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,664
What this means is that y and z can move around in the same piston dance 

102
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:22,540
motion we saw before as they trade off the remaining 0.75 units of real estate.

103
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,809
In terms of our typical way of visualizing a sphere, 

104
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:30,930
this corresponds to slicing the sphere along the plane where x is 

105
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,300
0.5 and looking at the circle formed by all of the choices for y and z on that sphere.

106
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,254
As you increase the value of x, the amount of real estate left 

107
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:44,850
over for y and z is smaller, and this more constrained piston 

108
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,620
dance is what it feels like for the circular slice to be smaller.

109
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,870
Eventually, once x reaches the value 1, there's no real estate left over, 

110
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,240
so you reach this singularity point where y and z are both forced to be 0.

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,120
The feeling here is a bit like being a bug on the surface of the sphere.

112
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,560
You are unable to see the whole sphere all at once.

113
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,389
Instead, you're just sitting on a single point, 

114
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,400
and you have some sense for what local movements are allowed.

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,295
In four dimensions and higher, we lose the crutch of the global view that a spatial 

116
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:25,020
visual offers, but the fundamental rules of this real estate exchange remain the same.

117
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,598
If you fix one slider in place and watch the other three trade off, 

118
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,841
this is basically what it means to take a slice of the 4d sphere to get a 

119
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:38,256
small 3d sphere, in much the same way that fixing one of the sliders for the 

120
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:43,360
three-dimensional case give us a circular slice when the remaining two were free to vary.

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,579
Now watching these sliders move about and thinking about the real 

122
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,426
estate exchange is pretty fun, but it runs the risk of being aimless 

123
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:56,440
unless we have an actual high-dimensional puzzle to sink our teeth into.

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,746
So let's set aside the sliders for just a moment and bring in a very 

125
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:04,947
classic example of something that seems reasonable and even dull in two 

126
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:09,440
and three dimensions, but which is totally out of whack in higher dimensions.

127
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,100
To start, take a 2x2 box centered at the origin.

128
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,640
Its corners are on the vertices 1,1, 1,-1,-1,1, and 1,-1.

129
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,348
Draw four circles, each with radius 1, centered at these four vertices, 

130
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,500
so each one is tangent to two of its neighbors.

131
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,471
Now I want you to think of the circle centered at the origin which is just 

132
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,540
large enough to be touching those corner circles, tangent to each one of them.

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,728
What we want to do for this setup and for its analogies in 

134
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:46,040
higher dimensions is find the radius of that inner circle.

135
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,495
Here in two dimensions we can use the Pythagorean theorem to see that the distance 

136
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:57,220
from the origin to the corner of the box is the square root of 2, which is around 1.414.

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:06,235
Then you can subtract off this portion here, the radius of the corner circle, 

138
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:10,700
which by definition is 1, and that is 1,414.

139
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,820
No surprises here, that seems pretty reasonable.

140
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,080
Now do something analogous in three dimensions.

141
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,455
Draw a 2x2x2 cube whose corners have vertices 1,1,1,1,1,-1, on and on and on, 

142
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:29,611
and then we're going to take eight different spheres, each of which has a radius 1, 

143
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:36,060
and center them on these vertices so that each one is tangent to three of its neighbors.

144
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,783
Now again, think about the sphere centered at the origin which is 

145
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:44,400
just large enough to be barely touching those eight corner spheres.

146
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,690
As before, we can start by thinking about the distance from 

147
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,280
the origin to the corner of the box, say the corner at 1,1,1.

148
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,923
By the way, I guess I still haven't yet explicitly said that the 

149
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,511
way distances work in higher dimensions is always to add up the 

150
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,380
squares of the components in each direction and take the square root.

151
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,911
If you've never seen why this follows from the Pythagorean theorem just in the 

152
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:12,439
two-dimensional case, it's actually a really fun puzzle to think about, 

153
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:16,506
and I've left the relevant image up on the screen for any of you who want to pause 

154
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:17,340
and ponder on it.

155
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,358
Anyway, in our case the distance between the origin and the corner 1,1,1 is the square 

156
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:28,820
root of 1 squared plus 1 squared plus 1 squared, or square root of 3, which is about 1.73.

157
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,730
So the radius of that inner sphere is going to be this quantity 

158
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,460
minus the radius of a corner sphere, which by definition is 1.

159
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,060
And again, 0.73 seems like a reasonable radius for that inner sphere.

160
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,040
But what happens to that inner radius as you increase dimensions?

161
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,842
Obviously the reason I bring this up is that something surprising will happen, 

162
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:54,069
and some of you might see where this is going, 

163
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,580
but I actually don't want it to feel like a surprise.

164
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,041
As fun as it is to wow people with counterintuitive facts and math, 

165
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,880
the goal here is genuine understanding, not shock.

166
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,703
For higher dimensions we'll be using sliders to get a gut feel for what's going on, 

167
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:13,156
but since it's kind of a different way of viewing things it helps to get a running start 

168
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:17,559
by looking back at how to analyze the two and three-dimensional cases in the context of 

169
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:17,960
sliders.

170
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,160
First things first, how do you think about a circle centered at a corner like 1,-1?

171
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,309
Well previously, for a circle centered at the origin, 

172
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:32,655
the amount of real estate belonging to both x and y was dependent on their 

173
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,220
distance from the number 0.

174
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,041
And it's the same basic idea here as you move around the center, 

175
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:42,058
it's just that the real estate might be dependent on the distance between each coordinate 

176
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:43,040
and some other number.

177
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,562
So for this circle, centered at 1,-1, the amount of real 

178
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:51,540
estate belonging to x is the square of its distance from 1.

179
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,420
Likewise, the real estate belonging to y is the square of its distance from negative 1.

180
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,545
Other than that, the look and feel with this piston 

181
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:02,380
dance trade-off is completely the same.

182
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,820
For simplicity, we'll only focus on one of these circles, the one centered at 1,-1.

183
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,002
Now ask yourself, what does it mean to find a circle centered at the origin large 

184
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:17,020
enough to be tangent to this guy when we're thinking just in terms of sliders?

185
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,805
Well notice how this point of tangency happens 

186
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,490
when the x and y coordinates are both the same.

187
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,492
Or phrased differently, at the point of this corner circle closest to the origin, 

188
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:34,590
the real estate is shared evenly between x and y.

189
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,090
This will be important for later, so let's really dig in and think about why it's true.

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,302
Imagine perturbing that point slightly, maybe moving x a little closer to 0, 

191
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:47,270
which means y would have to move a little away from 0.

192
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,897
The change in x would have to be a little smaller than the change in y, 

193
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,719
since the real estate it gains by moving farther away from 1 is more 

194
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:59,430
expensive than the real estate that y loses by getting closer to 1.

195
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,610
But from the perspective of the origin point 0,0 that trade-off is reversed.

196
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,324
The resulting change to x squared is smaller than the resulting change to y squared, 

197
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:15,273
since when real estate is measured with respect to 0,0, 

198
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:18,870
that move of y towards 1 is the more expensive one.

199
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,523
What this means is that any slight perturbation away from this point where 

200
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:29,130
real estate is shared evenly results in an increasing distance from the origin.

201
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,036
The reason we care is that this point is tangent to the inner circle, 

202
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:37,450
so we can also think about it as being a point of the inner circle.

203
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,070
And this will be very useful for higher dimensions.

204
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,470
It gives us a reference point to understanding the radius of that inner circle.

205
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,888
Specifically, you can ask how much real estate is shared between x and y at 

206
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:54,790
this point when real estate measurements are done with respect to the origin 0,0.

207
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,894
For example, down here in two dimensions both x and y dip below 

208
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:05,821
0.5 in this configuration, so the total value x squared plus y 

209
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:10,670
squared is going to be less than 0.5 squared plus 0.5 squared.

210
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,442
Comparing to this halfway point is really going to come in handy 

211
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:17,130
for wrapping our mind around what happens in higher dimensions.

212
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,750
Taking things one step at a time, let's bump it up to three dimensions.

213
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,270
Consider the corner sphere with radius 1 centered at 1,1,1.

214
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,393
The point on that sphere that's closest to the origin corresponds to the configuration 

215
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:37,630
of sliders where x, y, and z are all reaching down toward 0 and equal to each other.

216
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,017
Again, they all have to go a little beyond that halfway point because the 

217
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:49,510
position 0.5 only accounts for 0.5 squared, or 0.25 units of real estate.

218
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,460
So with all three coordinates getting a third of a unit of real estate, 

219
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,950
they need to be farther out.

220
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,024
And again, since this is a point where the corner sphere is tangent to the inner sphere, 

221
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,850
it's also a point of the inner sphere.

222
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,782
So with reference to the origin 0,0,0, think about the amount of real estate 

223
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:14,090
shared between x, y, and z in this position corresponding to the tangent point.

224
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:21,430
It's definitely less than 0.75 since all three of these are smaller than 0.5, 

225
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,830
so each one has less than 0.25 units of real estate.

226
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,950
And again, we sit back and feel comfortable with this result, right?

227
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,590
The inner sphere is smaller than the corner spheres.

228
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,270
But things get interesting when we move up into four dimensions.

229
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:44,294
Our 2x2x2x2 box is going to have 16 vertices at 1111, 111-1, 

230
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:51,470
and so on, with all possible binary combinations of 1 and negative 1.

231
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,541
What this means is that there are 16 unit spheres centered at these corners, 

232
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,850
each one tangent to four of its neighbors.

233
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,550
As before, we'll just be focusing on one of them, the one centered at 1111.

234
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,035
The point of the sphere closest to the origin corresponds to the configuration 

235
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:14,890
of sliders where all four coordinates reach exactly halfway between 1 and 0.

236
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,574
And that's because when one of the coordinates is 0.5 units away from 1, 

237
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:24,589
it has 0.25 units of real estate with respect to the point 1.

238
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,379
We do the same trick as before, thinking of this now as a point 

239
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,623
of the inner sphere and measuring things with respect to the origin, 

240
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,350
but you can already see what's cool about four dimensions.

241
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,030
As you switch to thinking of real estate with respect to 0000, 

242
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,694
it's still the case that each of these four coordinates has 0.25 units of real estate, 

243
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:48,730
making for a total of one shared between the four coordinates.

244
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,710
In other words, that inner sphere is precisely the same size as the corner spheres.

245
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,812
This matches with what you see numerically, by the way, 

246
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:03,076
where you can compute the distance between the origin and the corner, 1111, 

247
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:07,622
is the square root of 4, and then when you subtract off the radius of one of the 

248
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:09,530
corner spheres, what you get is 1.

249
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,790
But there's something much more satisfying about seeing it, rather than just computing it.

250
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,570
In particular, here's a cool aspect of the fact that that inner sphere has radius 1.

251
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,518
Move things around so that all of the real estate goes to the coordinate x, 

252
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,910
and you'll end up at the point 1, 0, 0, 0.

253
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,730
This point is actually touching the 2x2x2x2 box, 

254
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,358
and when you're stuck thinking in the two or three dimensional cases, 

255
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:40,847
this fact that the inner sphere has radius 1, the same size as the corner spheres, 

256
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:44,550
and that it touches the box, well it just seems too big.

257
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,887
But it's important to realize this is fundamentally a four-dimensional phenomenon, 

258
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:52,990
and you just can't cram it down into smaller dimensions.

259
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,070
But things get weirder.

260
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,750
Let's knock it up to five dimensions.

261
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,873
In this case we have quite a few corner spheres, 32 in total, 

262
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:05,450
but again for simplicity we'll only be thinking about the ones centered at 11111.

263
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,226
Think about the point of the sphere closest to the origin, 

264
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:13,550
where all five coordinates are equally splitting the one unit of shared real estate.

265
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,110
This time each coordinate is a little higher than 0.5.

266
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,914
If they reach down to 0.5, each one would have 0.25 units of real estate, 

267
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,970
giving a total of 1.25, which is too much.

268
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,123
But the tables are turned when you view this as a point on the inner sphere, 

269
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:37,008
because with respect to the origin, this configuration has much more than one unit of 

270
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:37,690
real estate.

271
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,903
Not only is every coordinate more than 0.5 units away from 0, 

272
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:48,954
but the larger number of dimensions means that there's more total real estate when 

273
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,050
you add it all up.

274
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,690
Specifically you can compute that the radius of that inner sphere is about 1.24.

275
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,575
The intuitive feel for what that means is that the sliders can roam over 

276
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,510
more territory than what just a single unit of real estate would allow.

277
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,310
One fun way to see what this means is to adjust everything 

278
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,010
so that all of the real estate goes to just one coordinate.

279
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,347
Because this coordinate can reach beyond one, what you are seeing is 

280
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:20,810
that this five dimensional inner sphere actually pokes outside the box.

281
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,500
But to really get a feel for how strange things become, 

282
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,330
as a last example I want to jump up into ten dimensions.

283
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,110
Remember, all this means is that points have ten coordinates.

284
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,498
For a sphere with radius 1, a single unit of real 

285
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:38,610
estate must be shared among all ten of those coordinates.

286
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,152
As always, the point of this corner sphere closest to the origin 

287
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:46,730
is the one where all ten coordinates split the real estate evenly.

288
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,310
And here you can really see just how far away this feels from the origin.

289
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,233
Or phrased differently, that inner sphere is allowed 

290
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,670
to have a very large amount of real estate.

291
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,690
In fact, you can compute that the radius of the inner sphere is about 2.16.

292
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,011
And viewed from this perspective, where you have ten full dimensions to share 

293
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,273
that real estate, doesn't it actually feel somewhat reasonable that the inner 

294
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:17,590
sphere should have a radius more than twice as big as all those corner spheres?

295
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,172
To get a sense for just how big this inner sphere is, 

296
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:26,877
look back in two dimensions and imagine a 4x4 box bounding all four circles 

297
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:27,930
from the outside.

298
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,153
Or go to three dimensions and imagine a 4x4x4 box 

299
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:35,830
bounding all of those corner spheres from the outside.

300
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:42,057
Way up here in ten dimensions, that quote-unquote inner sphere is actually large enough 

301
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:47,570
to poke outside of that outer bounding box, since it has a diameter bigger than four.

302
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,953
I know that seems crazy, but you have to realize that the face of the box is 

303
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:59,710
always two units away from the origin, no matter how high the dimension is.

304
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,250
And fundamentally it's because it only involves moving along a single axis.

305
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,394
But the point 1111111111, which determines the inner sphere's radius, 

306
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:14,570
is actually really far away from the center, all the way up here in ten dimensions.

307
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,211
And it's because all ten of those dimensions add 

308
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,750
a full unit of real estate for that point.

309
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,869
And of course as you keep upping the dimensions, 

310
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,450
that inner sphere just keeps growing without bound.

311
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,472
Not only is it poking outside of these boxes, but the proportion of the inner sphere 

312
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:38,735
lying inside the box decreases exponentially towards zero as the dimension keeps 

313
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:39,450
increasing.

314
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,384
So taking a step back, one of the things I like about using this slider method 

315
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:48,156
for teaching is that when I shared it with a few friends, 

316
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:51,691
the way they started to talk about higher dimensions became a little less 

317
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:55,466
metaphysical and started to sound more like how you would hear a mathematician 

318
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,470
talk about the topic.

319
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,805
Rather than skeptically asking whether or not ten-dimensional space is a real thing, 

320
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:04,852
recognizing that it's exactly as real as numbers are, 

321
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:08,802
people would actually probe at what other properties high-dimensional 

322
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:12,470
spheres have and what other shapes feel like in terms of sliders.

323
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,179
This box situation is just one in a number of things that feel very 

324
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,635
crazy about higher dimensional spheres, and it's really fun to 

325
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:24,310
think about these others in the context of sliders and real estate.

326
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,809
It's obviously limited, I mean you're a bug on the surface of these objects, 

327
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,250
only getting a feel for one point at a time and for the rules of movement.

328
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,509
Also, geometry can be quite nice when it's coordinate-free, 

329
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,898
and this is the opposite of that, but it does give a foothold 

330
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:43,670
into thinking about high-dimensional shapes a little more concretely.

331
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,980
Now you could say that viewing things with sliders is no 

332
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,930
different from thinking about things purely analytically.

333
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,217
I mean, it's honestly little more than representing each coordinate literally, 

334
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,530
it's kind of the most obvious thing you might do.

335
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,468
But this small move makes it much more possible to play with the thought of a 

336
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:07,741
high-dimensional point, and even little things like thinking about the squares 

337
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:12,014
of coordinates as real estate can shed light on some seemingly strange aspects 

338
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:16,450
of high dimensions, like just how far away the corner of a box is from its center.

339
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,978
If anything, the fact that it's such a direct representation of a 

340
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:24,834
purely analytic description is exactly what makes it such a faithful 

341
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,690
reflection of what genuinely doing math in higher dimensions entails.

342
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,503
We're still flying in the clouds, trusting the instruments of analytic reasoning, 

343
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:37,566
but this is a redesign of those instruments, one which better takes advantage of 

344
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:41,530
the fact that such a large portion of our brains goes towards image processing.

345
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,705
I mean, just because you can't visualize something 

346
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:47,090
doesn't mean you can't still think about it visually.
