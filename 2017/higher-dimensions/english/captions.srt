1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Math is sometimes a real tease. It seduces us with the beauty of reasoning

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,120
geometrically in two and three dimensions where there's this really

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,920
nice back and forth between pairs or triplets of numbers and spatial stuff

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,240
that our visual cortex is good at processing. For example, if you think

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,920
about a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin, you are in effect

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,800
conceptualizing every possible pair of numbers x and y that satisfy a

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,200
certain numerical property that x squared plus y squared is 1. And the

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,720
usefulness here is that a lot of facts that look opaque in a purely analytic

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,440
context become quite clear geometrically and vice versa.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,600
Honestly, this channel has been the direct beneficiary of this back and

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,760
forth since it offers such a rich library of that special category of

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,720
cleverness that involves connecting two seemingly disparate ideas. And I don't

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
just mean the general back and forth between pairs or triplets of numbers and

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,760
spatial reasoning. I mean this specific one between sums of squares and circles

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,320
and spheres. It's at the heart of the video I made showing how pi is connected

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,760
to number theory and primes and the one showing how to visualize all possible

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,100
Pythagorean triples. It also underlies the video on the Borsuk-Ulam theorem

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,760
being used to solve what was basically a counting puzzle by using topological

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,640
facts about spheres. There is no doubt that the ability to frame analytic facts

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,520
geometrically is very useful for math. But it's all a tease because when you

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,360
start asking questions about quadruplets or quintuplets or 100

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,840
tuples of numbers, it's frustrating. The constraints on our physical space seem

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,640
to have constrained our intuitions about geometry and we lose this back and forth.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,960
I mean it is completely reasonable to imagine that there are problems out

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,760
there that would have clever and illuminating solutions if only we knew

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,680
how to conceptualize, say, lists of 10 numbers as individual points in some

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,240
space. For mathematicians or computer scientists or physicists, problems that

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,160
are framed in terms of lists of numbers, lists of more than three numbers, are a

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,120
regular part of the job. And the standard approach to actually doing math in

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,680
higher dimensions is to use two and three dimensions for analogy but to

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,880
fundamentally reason about things just analytically, somewhat analogous to a

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,000
pilot relying primarily on instruments and not sight while flying through the

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,880
clouds. Now what I want to offer here is a hybrid between the purely geometric

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,240
and the purely analytic views, a method for making the analytic reasoning a

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,900
little more visual in a way that generalizes to arbitrarily high

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,120
dimensions. And to drive home the value of a tactic like this, I want to share

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
with you a very famous example where analogies with two and three dimensions

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,600
cannot help because of something extremely counterintuitive that only

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,040
happens in higher dimensions. The hope though is that what I show you here

40
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,160
helps to make that phenomenon more intuitive. The focus throughout will be

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,140
on higher dimensional spheres. For example, when we talk about a four

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,200
dimensional sphere, say with radius 1 centered at the origin, what that actually

43
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,920
is is the set of all quadruplets of numbers x, y, z, w where the sum of the

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,840
squares of these numbers is 1. What I have pictured here now is multiple

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,400
three-dimensional slices of a 4d sphere projected back into three dimensions. But

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,640
it's confusing and even if you do wrap your head around it, it just pushes the

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,720
question back to how you would think about a 5 or a 6 or a 7 dimensional

48
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,880
sphere. And more importantly, squinting your eyes to understand a projection

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,360
like this is not very reflective of what doing math with a 4d sphere actually

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,360
entails. Instead the basic idea here will be to get very literal about it and

51
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,000
to think about four separate numbers. I like to picture four vertical number

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,720
lines with sliders to represent each number. Each configuration of these

53
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,920
sliders is a point in 4d space, a quadruplet of numbers, and what it means

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,440
to be on a 4d unit sphere centered at the origin is that the sum of the squares

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:20,400
of these four values is 1. Our goal is to understand which movements of these

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,760
sliders correspond to movements on the sphere. To do that it helps if we knock

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,800
things down to two dimensions where we can actually see the circle. So ask

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,240
yourself, what's a nice way to think about this relation that x squared plus y

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,120
squared is 1? Well I like to think of the value of x squared as the real estate

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,840
belonging to x, and likewise the value of y squared is the real estate belonging to

61
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,680
y, and that they have a total of one unit of real estate to share between them. So

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,520
moving around on the circle corresponds to a constant exchange of real estate

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,360
between the two variables. Part of the reason I choose this term is that it

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,200
lets us make a very useful analogy that real estate is cheap near zero and more

65
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,520
expensive away from zero. To see this consider starting off in a position

66
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,960
where x equals 1 and y is 0, meaning x has all of the real estate to itself,

67
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,760
which in our usual geometric picture means we're on the rightmost point of

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,640
the circle. If you move x down just a bit to 0.9 the value of x squared changes to

69
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,280
0.81, so it has in effect given up 0.19 units of real estate. But for y squared

70
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,480
to increase by that same amount, y has to move an entire 0.44 units away from zero,

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,920
more than four times the amount that x moved. In other words, x changed a little

72
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,480
to give up expensive real estate so that y could move a lot and gain the same

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,920
value of cheap real estate. In terms of the usual circle drawing, this

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,000
corresponds to the steep slope near the right side. A small nudge in x allows for

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,880
a very big change to y. Moving forward let's add some tick marks to these

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,880
lines to indicate what 0.05 units of real estate looks like at each point.

77
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,080
That is, how much would x have to change so that the value of x squared changes

78
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,320
by 0.05. As you walk around the circle the trade-off in value between x squared

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,760
and y squared gives this piston-looking dance motion where the sliders are

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,160
moving more slowly away from zero, because real estate is more expensive in

81
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,840
those regions. There are just more tick marks to cover per unit distance. Also a

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
nice side effect of the term real estate is that it aligns naturally with the

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,920
fact that it comes in units of distance squared, so the square root of the total

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,800
real estate among all coordinates gives us the distance from the origin. For a

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
unit sphere in three dimensions, the set of all triplets x, y, z where the sum of

86
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,560
their squares is one, all we have to do is add a third slider for z. But these

87
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,920
three sliders still only have the one unit of real estate to share between

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,520
them. To get a feel for this, imagine holding x in place at 0.5 where it

89
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,240
occupies 0.25 units of real estate. What this means is that y and z can move

90
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,360
around in the same piston-dance motion we saw before as they trade off the

91
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,320
remaining 0.75 units of real estate. In terms of our typical way of visualizing

92
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,160
a sphere, this corresponds to slicing the sphere along the plane where x is

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,840
0.5 and looking at the circle formed by all of the choices for y and z on that

94
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,880
sphere. As you increase the value of x, the amount of real estate left over for

95
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,040
y and z is smaller, and this more constrained piston-dance is what it

96
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,240
feels like for the circular slice to be smaller. Eventually once x reaches the

97
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,640
value 1, there's no real estate left over, so you reach this singularity point

98
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,360
where y and z are both forced to be 0. The feeling here is a bit like being a

99
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,180
bug on the surface of the sphere. You are unable to see the whole sphere all at

100
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,320
once. Instead you're just sitting on a single point and you have some sense for

101
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:18,360
what local movements are allowed. In four dimensions and higher we lose the crutch

102
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,360
of the global view that a spatial visual offers, but the fundamental rules

103
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,600
of this real estate exchange remain the same. If you fix one slider in place and

104
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,480
watch the other three trade off, this is basically what it means to take a slice

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,560
of the 4d sphere to get a small 3d sphere, in much the same way that fixing

106
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,520
one of the sliders for the three-dimensional case give us a

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,040
circular slice when the remaining two were free to vary. Now watching these

108
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
sliders move about and thinking about the real estate exchange is pretty fun,

109
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,280
but it runs the risk of being aimless unless we have an actual high

110
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,760
dimensional puzzle to sink our teeth into. So let's set aside the sliders for

111
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,480
just a moment and bring in a very classic example of something that seems

112
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,740
reasonable and even dull in two and three dimensions, but which is totally

113
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,680
out of whack in higher dimensions. To start take a 2x2 box centered at the

114
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,600
origin. Its corners are on the vertices 1,1, 1,-1,-1,1, and

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,880
1,-1. Draw four circles each with radius 1 centered at these four

116
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,280
vertices, so each one is tangent to two of its neighbors. Now I want you to think

117
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,000
of the circle centered at the origin which is just large enough to be

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,320
touching those corner circles, tangent to each one of them. What we want to do for

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
this setup and for its analogies in higher dimensions is find the radius of

120
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,000
that inner circle. Here in two dimensions we can use the Pythagorean

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,880
theorem to see that the distance from the origin to the corner of the box is

122
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,740
the square root of 2 which is around 1.414. Then you can

123
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,800
subtract off this portion here the radius of the corner circle which by

124
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,400
definition is 1, and that means the radius of the inner circle is square

125
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,360
root of 2 minus 1, or about 0.414. No surprises here, that seems pretty

126
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,560
reasonable. Now do something analogous in three dimensions. Draw a 2x2x2 cube

127
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,760
whose corners have vertices 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1, and then we're going to take

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,240
eight different spheres each of which has a radius 1 and center them on these

129
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,160
vertices so that each one is tangent to three of its neighbors. Now again think

130
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
about the sphere centered at the origin which is just large enough to be barely

131
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,800
touching those eight corner spheres. As before we can start by thinking about

132
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,760
the distance from the origin to the corner of the box, say the corner at 1,1,1.

133
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,200
By the way I guess I still haven't yet explicitly said that the way distances

134
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,160
work in higher dimensions is always to add up the squares of the components in

135
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,080
each direction and take the square root. If you've never seen why this follows

136
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,120
from the Pythagorean theorem just in the two-dimensional case it's actually a

137
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,520
really fun puzzle to think about and I've left the relevant image up on the

138
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,320
screen for any of you who want to pause and ponder on it. Anyway in our case the

139
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,000
distance between the origin and the corner 1,1,1 is the square root of 1

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,960
squared plus 1 squared plus 1 squared or square root of 3 which is about 1.73.

141
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,360
So the radius of that inner sphere is going to be this quantity minus the

142
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,780
radius of a corner sphere which by definition is 1. And again 0.73 seems

143
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,040
like a reasonable radius for that inner sphere. But what happens to that inner

144
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,880
radius as you increase dimensions? Obviously the reason I bring this up is

145
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,240
that something surprising will happen and some of you might see where this is

146
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,040
going but actually don't want it to feel like a surprise. As fun as it is to

147
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,360
wow people with counterintuitive facts and math the goal here is genuine

148
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,920
understanding not shock. For higher dimensions we'll be using sliders to

149
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,440
get a gut feel for what's going on but since it's kind of a different way of

150
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,360
viewing things it helps to get a running start by looking back at how to analyze

151
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,440
the two and three-dimensional cases in the context of sliders. First things

152
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,200
first how do you think about a circle centered at a corner like 1,1?

153
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,120
Well previously for a circle centered at the origin the amount of real estate

154
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,360
belonging to both x and y was dependent on their distance from the number 0. And

155
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,880
it's the same basic idea here as you move around the center it's just that

156
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,000
the real estate might be dependent on the distance between each coordinate and

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,320
some other number. So for this circle centered at 1,1 the amount of

158
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,040
real estate belonging to x is the square of its distance from 1. Likewise the

159
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,320
real estate belonging to y is the square of its distance from negative 1.

160
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,200
Other than that the look and feel with this piston dance trade-off is

161
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,880
completely the same. For simplicity we'll only focus on one of these

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,720
circles the one centered at 1,1. Now ask yourself what does it mean to find a

163
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,080
circle centered at the origin large enough to be tangent to this guy when

164
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,880
we're thinking just in terms of sliders?

165
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Well notice how this point of tangency happens when the x and y coordinates are

166
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,160
both the same. Or phrased differently at the point of this corner circle closest

167
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,800
to the origin the real estate is shared evenly between x and y. This will be

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,480
important for later so let's really dig in and think about why it's true.

169
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Imagine perturbing that point slightly maybe moving x a little closer to 0

170
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,760
which means y would have to move a little away from 0. The change in x

171
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,840
would have to be a little smaller than the change in y since the real estate it

172
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,200
gains by moving farther away from 1 is more expensive than the real estate that

173
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,000
y loses by getting closer to 1. But from the perspective of the origin point 0,0

174
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,240
that trade-off is reversed. The resulting change to x squared is smaller than the

175
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,120
resulting change to y squared since when real estate is measured with respect to

176
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,960
0,0 that move of y towards 1 is the more expensive one. What this means is

177
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,240
that any slight perturbation away from this point where real estate is shared

178
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,200
evenly results in an increasing distance from the origin. The reason we care is

179
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,520
that this point is tangent to the inner circle so we can also think about it as

180
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,520
being a point of the inner circle. And this will be very useful for higher

181
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,760
dimensions it gives us a reference point to understanding the radius of that

182
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,640
inner circle. Specifically you can ask how much real estate is shared between

183
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,160
x and y at this point when real estate measurements are done with respect to

184
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,160
the origin 0,0. For example down here in two dimensions both x and y dip below

185
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,920
0.5 in this configuration so the total value x squared plus y squared is going

186
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,920
to be less than 0.5 squared plus 0.5 squared. Comparing to this halfway point

187
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,200
is really going to come in handy for wrapping our mind around what happens in

188
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,120
higher dimensions. Taking things one step at a time let's bump it up to three

189
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:27,480
dimensions. Consider the corner sphere with radius 1 centered at 1,1,1. The point

190
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,120
on that sphere that's closest to the origin corresponds to the configuration

191
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,240
of sliders where x,y,z are all reaching down towards 0 and equal to each

192
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,400
other. Again they all have to go a little beyond that halfway point because the

193
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:50,760
position 0.5 only accounts for 0.5 squared or 0.25 units of real estate. So

194
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,920
with all three coordinates getting a third of a unit of real estate they need

195
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,480
to be farther out. And again since this is a point where the corner sphere is

196
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,360
tangent to the inner sphere it's also a point of the inner sphere. So with

197
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,800
reference to the origin 0,0,0 think about the amount of real estate shared between

198
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,080
x,y,z in this position corresponding to the tangent point. It's definitely less

199
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,320
than 0.75 since all three of these are smaller than 0.5 so each one has less

200
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,040
than 0.25 units of real estate. And again we sit back and feel comfortable with

201
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,760
this result right the inner sphere is smaller than the corner spheres. But

202
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,600
things get interesting when we move up into four dimensions. Our 2x2x2x2

203
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,720
box is going to have 16 vertices at 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 negative 1 and so on with all

204
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,440
possible binary combinations of 1 and negative 1. What this means is that there

205
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,480
are 16 unit spheres centered at these corners each one tangent to four of its

206
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,080
neighbors. As before we'll just be focusing on one of them the one centered

207
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,500
at 1 1 1 1. The point of the sphere closest to the origin corresponds to the

208
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,900
configuration of sliders where all four coordinates reach exactly halfway

209
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,220
between 1 and 0. And that's because when one of the coordinates is 0.5 units away

210
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,800
from 1 it has 0.25 units of real estate with respect to the point 1. We do the

211
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,220
same trick as before thinking of this now as a point of the inner sphere and

212
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,100
measuring things with respect to the origin. But you can already see what's

213
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,900
cool about four dimensions. As you switch to thinking of real estate with respect

214
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,980
to 0 0 0 0 it's still the case that each of these four coordinates has 0.25

215
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,220
units of real estate making for a total of one shared between the four

216
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,980
coordinates. In other words that inner sphere is precisely the same size as the

217
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,500
corner spheres. This matches with what you see numerically by the way where you

218
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,320
can compute the distance between the origin and the corner 1 1 1 1 is the

219
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,900
square root of 4 and then when you subtract off the radius of one of the

220
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,020
corner spheres what you get is 1. But there's something much more satisfying

221
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,580
about seeing it rather than just computing it. In particular here's a

222
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,740
cool aspect of the fact that that inner sphere has radius 1. Move things around

223
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,780
so that all of the real estate goes to the coordinate x and you'll end up at

224
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:31,540
the point 1 0 0 0. This point is actually touching the 2 by 2 by 2 by 2 box and

225
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,060
when you're stuck thinking in the two or three dimensional cases this fact

226
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,300
that the inner sphere has radius 1 the same size as the corner spheres and that

227
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,780
it touches the box

228
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,140
well it just seems too big but it's important to realize this is

229
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,260
fundamentally a four-dimensional phenomenon and you just can't cram it

230
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,340
down into smaller dimensions. But things get weirder

231
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,140
let's knock it up to five dimensions. In this case we have quite a few corner

232
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,540
spheres 32 in total but again for simplicity we'll only be thinking about

233
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,580
the ones centered at 11111. Think about the point of the sphere closest to the

234
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,980
origin where all five coordinates are equally splitting the one unit of shared

235
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,980
real estate. This time each coordinate is a little higher than 0.5. If they reach

236
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,500
down to 0.5 each one would have 0.25 units of real estate giving a total of

237
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,500
1.25 which is too much. But the tables are turned when you view this as a point

238
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,620
on the inner sphere because with respect to the origin this configuration has

239
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:42,340
much more than one unit of real estate. Not only is every coordinate more than

240
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,300
0.5 units away from 0 but the larger number of dimensions means that there's

241
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,020
more total real estate when you add it all up. Specifically you can compute that

242
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,980
the radius of that inner sphere is about 1.24. The intuitive feel for what that

243
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,020
means is that the sliders can roam over more territory than what just a single

244
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,740
unit of real estate would allow. One fun way to see what this means is to adjust

245
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,220
everything so that all of the real estate goes to just one coordinate.

246
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,420
Because this coordinate can reach beyond one what you are seeing is that this

247
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:23,700
five-dimensional inner sphere actually pokes outside the box. But to really get

248
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,860
a feel for how strange things become as a last example I want to jump up into 10

249
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,900
dimensions. Remember all this means is that points have 10 coordinates. For a

250
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,820
sphere with radius 1 a single unit of real estate must be shared among all 10

251
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,340
of those coordinates. As always the point of this corner sphere closest to the

252
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,660
origin is the one where all 10 coordinates split the real estate evenly.

253
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,180
And here you can really see just how far away this feels from the origin. Or

254
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,140
phrased differently, that inner sphere is allowed to have a very large amount of

255
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,020
real estate. In fact you can compute that the radius of the inner sphere is

256
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,700
about 2.16. And viewed from this perspective where you have 10 full

257
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,700
dimensions to share that real estate doesn't it actually feel somewhat

258
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,420
reasonable that the inner sphere should have a radius more than twice as big as

259
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,260
all those corner spheres. To get a sense for just how big this inner sphere is

260
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,820
look back in two dimensions and imagine a 4x4 box bounding all four circles

261
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,060
from the outside. Or go to three dimensions and imagine a 4x4x4 box

262
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,500
bounding all of those corner spheres from the outside. Way up here in 10

263
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,420
dimensions that quote-unquote inner sphere is actually large enough to poke

264
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:49,540
outside of that outer bounding box since it has a diameter bigger than 4.

265
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,060
I know that seems crazy but you have to realize that the face of the box is

266
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,860
always two units away from the origin no matter how high the dimension is and

267
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,300
fundamentally it's because it only involves moving along a single axis. But

268
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,160
the point 11111111111 which determines the inner sphere's radius is actually

269
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,460
really far away from the center all the way up here in 10 dimensions. And it's

270
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,580
because all 10 of those dimensions add a full unit of real estate for that point.

271
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,100
And of course as you keep upping the dimensions that inner sphere just keeps

272
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,340
growing without bound. Not only is it poking outside of these boxes but the

273
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,620
proportion of the inner sphere lying inside the box decreases exponentially

274
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:43,180
towards zero as the dimension keeps increasing. So taking a step back one of

275
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,680
the things I like about using this slider method for teaching is that when

276
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,140
I shared it with a few friends the way they started to talk about higher

277
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,820
dimensions became a little less metaphysical and started to sound more

278
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,500
like how you would hear a mathematician talk about the topic. Rather than

279
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,820
skeptically asking whether or not 10 dimensional space is a real thing

280
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,620
recognizing that it's exactly as real as numbers are people would actually

281
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,060
probe at what other properties high dimensional spheres have and what other

282
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,620
shapes feel like in terms of sliders. This box situation is just one in a

283
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,420
number of things that feel very crazy about higher dimensional spheres and

284
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,740
it's really fun to think about these others in the context of sliders and

285
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,940
real estate. It's obviously limited, I mean you're a bug on the surface of

286
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,820
these objects only getting a feel for one point at a time and for the rules of

287
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,580
movement. Also geometry can be quite nice when it's coordinate free and this is

288
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,820
the opposite of that but it does give a foothold into thinking about high

289
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,900
dimensional shapes a little more concretely. Now you could say that

290
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,660
viewing things with sliders is no different from thinking about things

291
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,740
purely analytically. I mean it's honestly little more than representing

292
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,460
each coordinate literally, it's kind of the most obvious thing you might do but

293
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,700
this small move makes it much more possible to play with the thought of a

294
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,620
high dimensional point and even little things like thinking about the squares

295
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,780
of coordinates as real estate can shed light on some seemingly strange aspects

296
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,060
of high dimensions like just how far away the corner of a box is from its

297
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,380
center. If anything the fact that it's such a direct representation of a purely

298
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,740
analytic description is exactly what makes it such a faithful reflection of

299
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,020
what genuinely doing math and higher dimensions entails. We're still flying

300
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,900
in the clouds trusting the instruments of analytic reasoning but this is a

301
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,220
redesign of those instruments, one which better takes advantage of the fact that

302
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,180
such a large portion of our brains goes towards image processing. I mean just

303
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,700
because you can't visualize something doesn't mean you can't still think

304
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,620
about it visually.
