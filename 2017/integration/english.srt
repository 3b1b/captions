1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,200
This guy, Grothendieck, is somewhat of a mathematical idol to me, and I just love this quote, don't

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
you?

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,700
Too often in math, we dive into showing that a certain fact is true with a long series

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,560
of formulas before stepping back and making sure it feels reasonable, and preferably obvious,

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,440
at least at an intuitive level.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,680
In this video, I want to talk about integrals, and the thing I want to become almost obvious

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,040
is that they are an inverse of derivatives.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,120
Here we're just going to focus on one example, which is a kind of dual to the example of

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,440
a moving car I talked about in chapter 2 of the series, introducing derivatives.

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,480
Then in the next video we'll see how this same idea generalizes, but to a couple other

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,760
contexts.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Imagine you're sitting in a car, and you can't see out the window, all you see is

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
the speedometer.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,160
At some point the car starts moving, speeds up, and then slows back down to a stop, all

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,680
over the course of 8 seconds.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,040
The question is, is there a nice way to figure out how far you've travelled during that

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,040
time based only on your view of the speedometer?

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,400
Or better yet, can you find a distance function, s of t, that tells you how far you've travelled

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,040
after a given amount of time, t, somewhere between 0 and 8 seconds?

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,600
Let's say you take note of the velocity at every second, and make a plot over time

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,080
that looks something like this.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,560
And maybe you find that a nice function to model that velocity over time in m per second

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,840
is v of t equals t times 8 minus t.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
You might remember, in chapter 2 of the series we were looking at the opposite situation,

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
where you knew what a distance function was, s of t, and wanted to figure out the velocity

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
function from that.

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,860
There I showed how the derivative of a distance vs. time function gives you a velocity vs.

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,360
time function.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,960
So in our current situation, where all we know is velocity, it should make sense that

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,680
finding a distance vs. time function will come down to asking what function has a derivative

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,580
of t times 8 minus t.

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,500
This is often described as finding the antiderivative of a function, and indeed, that's what we'll

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,020
end up doing, and you could even pause right now and try that.

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,100
But first, I want to spend the bulk of this video showing how this question is related

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,340
to finding the area bounded by the velocity graph, because that helps to build an intuition

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,940
for a whole class of problems, things called integral problems in math and science.

37
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,760
To start off, notice that this question would be a lot easier if the car was just moving

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,500
at a constant velocity, right?

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,120
In that case, you could just multiply the velocity in m per second times the amount

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,100
of time that has passed in seconds, and that would give you the number of meters traveled.

41
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
And notice, you can visualize that product, that distance, as an area.

42
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,020
And if visualizing distance as area seems weird, I'm right there with you.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,500
It's just that on this plot, where the horizontal direction has units of seconds, and the vertical

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,260
direction has units of meters per second, units of area just very naturally correspond

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,100
to meters.

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,740
But what makes our situation hard is that velocity is not constant, it's incessantly

47
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,980
changing at every single instant.

48
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,700
It would even be a lot easier if it only ever changed at a handful of points, maybe staying

49
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,020
static for the first second, and then suddenly discontinuously jumping to a constant 7 m

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,620
per second for the next second, and so on, with discontinuous jumps to portions of constant

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,300
velocity.

52
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,220
That would make it uncomfortable for the driver, in fact it's actually physically impossible,

53
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,680
but it would make your calculations a lot more straightforward.

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,340
You could just compute the distance traveled on each interval by multiplying the constant

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,060
velocity on that interval by the change in time, and then just add all of those up.

56
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,380
So what we're going to do is approximate the velocity function as if it was constant

57
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,780
on a bunch of intervals, and then, as is common in calculus, we'll see how refining that

58
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,780
approximation leads us to something more precise.

59
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,660
Here, let's make this a little more concrete by throwing in some numbers.

60
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,080
Chop up the time axis between 0 and 8 seconds into many small intervals, each with some

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,940
little width dt, something like 0.25 seconds.

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,360
Now consider one of those intervals, like the one between t equals 1 and 1.25.

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,880
In reality, the car speeds up from 7 m per second to about 8.4 m per second during that

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,060
time, and you could find those numbers just by plugging in t equals 1 and t equals 1.25

65
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,460
to the equation for velocity.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,940
What we want to do is approximate the car's motion as if its velocity was constant on

67
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,060
that interval.

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,100
Again, the reason for doing that is we don't really know how to handle situations other

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,760
than constant velocity ones.

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,220
You could choose this constant to be anything between 7 and 8.4, it actually doesn't matter.

71
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,040
All that matters is that our sequence of approximations, whatever they are, gets better and better

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,820
as dt gets smaller and smaller.

73
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,060
That treating this car's journey as a bunch of discontinuous jumps in speed between portions

74
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,820
of constant velocity becomes a less wrong reflection of reality as we decrease the time

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,980
between those jumps.

76
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,420
So for convenience, on an interval like this, let's just approximate the speed with whatever

77
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,620
the true car's velocity is at the start of that interval, the height of the graph

78
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,060
above the left side, which in this case is 7.

79
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,700
So in this example interval, according to our approximation, the car moves 7 m per second

80
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,740
times 0.25 seconds.

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,740
That's 1.75 m, and it's nicely visualized as the area of this thin rectangle.

82
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,420
In truth, that's a little under the real distance traveled, but not by much.

83
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,500
And the same goes for every other interval.

84
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,020
The approximated distance is v of t times dt, it's just that you'd be plugging in

85
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,940
a different value for t at each one of these, giving a different height for each rectangle.

86
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,100
I'm going to write out an expression for the sum of the areas of all those rectangles

87
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,140
in kind of a funny way.

88
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,300
Take this symbol here, which looks like a stretched s for sum, and put a 0 at its bottom

89
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,220
and an 8 at its top, to indicate that we'll be ranging over time steps between 0 and 8

90
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
seconds.

91
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:55,540
And as I said, the amount we're adding up at each time step is v of t times dt.

92
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,380
Two things are implicit in this notation.

93
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,080
That value dt plays two separate roles.

94
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,380
Not only is it a factor in each quantity we're adding up, it also indicates the spacing between

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,620
each sampled time step.

96
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,100
So when you make dt smaller and smaller, even though it decreases the area of each rectangle,

97
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,580
it increases the total number of rectangles whose areas we're adding up, because if

98
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,900
they're thinner, it takes more of them to fill that space.

99
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,540
And second, the reason we don't use the usual sigma notation to indicate a sum is

100
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,860
that this expression is technically not any particular sum for any particular choice of

101
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
dt.

102
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,660
It's meant to express whatever that sum approaches as dt approaches 0.

103
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,100
And as you can see, what that approaches is the area bounded by this curve and the horizontal

104
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
axis.

105
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:52,260
Remember, smaller choices of dt indicate closer approximations for the original question,

106
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,620
how far does the car actually go?

107
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,440
So this limiting value for the sum, the area under this curve, gives us the precise answer

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,540
to the question in full, unapproximated precision.

109
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,140
Tell me that's not surprising.

110
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,580
We had this pretty complicated idea of approximations that can involve adding up a huge number of

111
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,580
very tiny things.

112
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,020
And yet, the value those approximations approach can be described so simply, it's just the

113
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,300
area underneath this curve.

114
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,740
This expression is called an integral of v of t, since it brings all of its values together.

115
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,540
It integrates them.

116
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,340
Now at this point, you could say, how does this help?

117
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,620
You've just reframed one hard question, finding how far the car has traveled, into

118
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,100
an equally hard problem, finding the area between this graph and the horizontal axis.

119
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,420
And you'd be right.

120
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,660
If the velocity-distance duo was the only thing we cared about, most of this video,

121
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,620
with all of the area under a curve nonsense, would be a waste of time.

122
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,480
We could just skip straight ahead to finding an antiderivative.

123
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
But finding the area between a function's graph and the horizontal axis is somewhat

124
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,760
of a common language for many disparate problems that can be broken down and approximated as

125
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,340
the sum of a large number of small things.

126
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,940
You'll see more in the next video, but for now I'll just say in the abstract that understanding

127
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,700
how to interpret and how to compute the area under a graph is a very general problem-solving

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
tool.

129
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,780
In fact, the first video of this series already covered the basics of how this works, but

130
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,100
now that we have more of a background with derivatives, we can take this idea to its

131
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,460
completion.

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:41,780
For our velocity example, think of this right endpoint as a variable, capital T.

133
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,380
So we're thinking of this integral of the velocity function between 0 and t, the area

134
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,540
under this curve between those inputs, as a function where the upper bound is the variable.

135
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,420
That area represents the distance the car has travelled after t seconds, right?

136
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,820
So in reality this is a distance vs. time function, s of t.

137
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,380
Now ask yourself, what is the derivative of that function?

138
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,500
On the one hand, a tiny change in distance over a tiny change in time is velocity, that

139
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,920
is what velocity means.

140
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,400
But there's another way to see this, purely in terms of this graph and this area, which

141
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,200
generalizes a lot better to other integral problems.

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,840
A slight nudge of dt to the input causes that area to increase, some little ds represented

143
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,800
by the area of this sliver.

144
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,140
The height of that sliver is the height of the graph at that point, v of t, and its width

145
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,920
is dt.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
And for small enough dt, we can basically consider that sliver to be a rectangle, so

147
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,720
this little bit of added area, ds, is approximately equal to v of t times dt.

148
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,960
And because that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller dt, the

149
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,280
derivative of that area function, ds, dt, at this point equals vt, the value of the

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,080
velocity function at whatever time we started on.

151
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,740
And that right there is a super general argument.

152
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,900
The derivative of any function giving the area under a graph like this is equal to the

153
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,580
function for the graph itself.

154
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:25,240
So, if our velocity function is t times 8-t, what should s be?

155
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,460
What function of t has a derivative of t times 8-t?

156
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,740
It's easier to see if we expand this out, writing it as 8t minus t squared, and then

157
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,620
we can just take each part one at a time.

158
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,700
What function has a derivative of 8t?

159
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,540
We know that the derivative of t squared is 2t, so if we just scale that up by a factor

160
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,020
of 4, we can see that the derivative of 4t squared is 8t.

161
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,900
And for that second part, what kind of function do you think might have negative t squared

162
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,700
as a derivative?

163
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,540
Using the power rule again, we know that the derivative of a cubic term, t cubed, gives

164
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,540
us a square term, 3t squared.

165
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,560
So if we just scale that down by a third, the derivative of 1 third t cubed is exactly

166
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,960
t squared.

167
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,580
And then making that negative, we see that negative 1 third t cubed has a derivative

168
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,820
of negative t squared.

169
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:29,700
Therefore, the antiderivative of our function, 8t minus t squared, is 4t squared minus 1

170
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,700
third t cubed.

171
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,720
But there's a slight issue here.

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,360
We could add any constant we want to this function, and its derivative is still 8t minus

173
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,840
t squared.

174
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,160
The derivative of a constant always goes to 0.

175
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,000
And if you were to graph s of t, you could think of this in the sense that moving a graph

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,640
of a distance function up and down does nothing to affect its slope at every input.

177
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,660
So in reality, there's actually infinitely many different possible antiderivative functions,

178
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,300
and every one of them looks like 4t squared minus 1 third t cubed plus c, for some constant

179
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,620
c.

180
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,380
But there is one piece of information we haven't used yet that will let us zero in on which

181
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,440
antiderivative to use, the lower bound of the integral.

182
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,200
This integral has to be zero when we drag that right endpoint all the way to the left

183
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,860
endpoint, right?

184
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,620
The distance travelled by the car between 0 seconds and 0 seconds is… well, zero.

185
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,300
So as we found, the area as a function of capital T is an antiderivative for the stuff

186
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,540
inside.

187
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,180
And to choose what constant to add to this expression, you subtract off the value of

188
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,180
that antiderivative function at the lower bound.

189
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,060
If you think about it for a moment, that ensures that the integral from the lower bound to

190
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,780
itself will indeed be zero.

191
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,900
As it so happens, when you evaluate the function we have here at t equals zero, you get zero.

192
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,020
So in this specific case, you don't need to subtract anything off.

193
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,380
For example, the total distance travelled during the full 8 seconds is this expression

194
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,460
evaluated at t equals 8, which is 85.33 minus 0.

195
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,260
So the answer as a whole is 85.33.

196
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,860
But a more typical example would be something like the integral between 1 and 7.

197
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,260
That's the area pictured here, and it represents the distance travelled between 1 second and

198
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,620
7 seconds.

199
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,300
What you do is evaluate the antiderivative we found at the top bound, 7, and subtract

200
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,260
off its value at the bottom bound, 1.

201
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,940
Notice that it doesn't matter which antiderivative we chose here, if for some reason it had a

202
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:58,300
constant added to it, like 5, that constant would cancel out.

203
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,100
More generally, any time you want to integrate some function, and remember, you think of

204
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,500
that as adding up values f of x times dx for inputs in a certain range, and then asking

205
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,960
what is that sum approach as dx approaches 0.

206
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,840
The first step to evaluating that integral is to find an antiderivative, some other function,

207
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,940
capital F, whose derivative is the thing inside the integral.

208
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,920
Then the integral equals this antiderivative evaluated at the top bound minus its value

209
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,000
at the bottom bound.

210
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,420
And this fact right here that you're staring at is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

211
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,060
And I want you to appreciate something kind of crazy about this fact.

212
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,220
The integral, the limiting value for the sum of all these thin rectangles, takes into

213
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,060
account every single input on the continuum, from the lower bound to the upper bound.

214
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,920
That's why we use the word integrate, it brings them all together.

215
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,700
And yet, to actually compute it using an antiderivative, you only look at two inputs, the top bound

216
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,480
and the bottom bound.

217
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,700
It almost feels like cheating.

218
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,120
Using the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all the information needed to add up the

219
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,560
values between those two bounds.

220
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,780
That's just crazy to me.

221
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,640
This idea is deep, and there's a lot packed into this whole concept, so let's recap

222
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,400
everything that just happened, shall we?

223
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,400
We wanted to figure out how far a car goes just by looking at the speedometer.

224
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,380
And what makes that hard is that velocity is always changing.

225
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,060
If you approximate velocity to be constant on multiple intervals, you could figure out

226
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,940
how far the car goes on each interval with multiplication, and then add all of those

227
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,540
up.

228
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,600
Better and better approximations for the original problem correspond to collections of rectangles

229
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,200
whose aggregate area is closer and closer to being the area under this curve between

230
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,620
the start time and the end time.

231
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,220
So that area under the curve is actually the precise distance traveled for the true

232
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,760
nowhere constant velocity function.

233
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,160
If you think of that area as a function itself, with a variable right endpoint, you can deduce

234
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,580
that the derivative of that area function must equal the height of the graph at every

235
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
point.

236
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,280
And that's really the key right there.

237
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,920
It means that to find a function giving this area, you ask, what function has v of t as

238
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,760
a derivative?

239
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,300
There are actually infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function, since you can always

240
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,360
just add some constant without affecting the derivative, so you account for that by subtracting

241
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,740
off the value of whatever antiderivative function you choose at the bottom bound.

242
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:53,120
By the way, one important thing to bring up before we leave is the idea of negative area.

243
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,740
What if the velocity function was negative at some point, meaning the car goes backwards?

244
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,300
It's still true that a tiny distance traveled ds on a little time interval is about equal

245
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,020
to the velocity at that time multiplied by the tiny change in time.

246
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,740
It's just that the number you'd plug in for velocity would be negative, so the tiny

247
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,780
change in distance is negative.

248
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,940
In terms of our thin rectangles, if a rectangle goes below the horizontal axis, like this,

249
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,480
its area represents a bit of distance traveled backwards, so if what you want in the end

250
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,040
is to find a distance between the car's start point and its end point, this is something

251
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,200
you'll want to subtract.

252
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,460
And that's generally true of integrals.

253
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,160
Whenever a graph dips below the horizontal axis, the area between that portion of the

254
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
graph and the horizontal axis is counted as negative.

255
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,340
What you'll commonly hear is that integrals don't measure area per se, they measure

256
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,060
the signed area between the graph and the horizontal axis.

257
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,280
Next up, I'll bring up more context where this idea of an integral and area under curves

258
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,940
comes up, along with some other intuitions for this fundamental theorem of calculus.

259
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,460
Maybe you remember, chapter 2 of this series introducing the derivative was sponsored by

260
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,400
the Art of Problem Solving, so I think there's something elegant to the fact that this video,

261
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,140
which is kind of a duel to that one, was also supported in part by the Art of Problem Solving.

262
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,220
I really can't imagine a better sponsor for this channel, because it's a company

263
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,860
whose books and courses I recommend to people anyway.

264
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,020
They were highly influential to me when I was a student developing a love for creative

265
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,900
math, so if you're a parent looking to foster your own child's love for the subject, or

266
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,260
if you're a student who wants to see what math has to offer beyond rote schoolwork,

267
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,780
I can't recommend the Art of Problem Solving enough.

268
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,440
Whether that's their newest development to build the right intuitions in elementary

269
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,880
school kids, called Beast Academy, or their courses in higher level topics and contest

270
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,960
preparation, going to aops.com slash 3blue1brown, or clicking on the link in the description,

271
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,760
lets them know you came from this channel, which may encourage them to support future

272
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,920
projects like this one.

273
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,800
I consider these videos a success not when they teach people a particular bit of math,

274
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,480
which can only ever be a drop in the ocean, but when they encourage people to go and explore

275
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,040
that expanse for themselves.

276
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,080
And the Art of Problem Solving is among the few great places to actually do that exploration.
