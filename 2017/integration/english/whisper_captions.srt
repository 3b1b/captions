1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,600
This guy, Grothendieck, is somewhat of a mathematical idol to me, and I just love this quote, don't

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:17,880
you?

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,720
Too often in math, we dive into showing that a certain fact is true with a long series

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,640
of formulas before stepping back and making sure it feels reasonable, and preferably obvious,

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,340
at least at an intuitive level.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,820
In this video, I want to talk about integrals, and the thing that I want to become almost

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,860
obvious is that they are an inverse of derivatives.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,180
Here we're just going to focus on one example, which is a kind of dual to the example of

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,140
a moving car that I talked about in chapter 2 of the series, introducing derivatives.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,200
Then in the next video we're going to see how this same idea generalizes, but to a couple

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,060
other contexts.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,840
Imagine you're sitting in a car, and you can't see out the window, all you see is

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,520
the speedometer.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,280
At some point the car starts moving, speeds up, and then slows back down to a stop, all

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,740
over the course of 8 seconds.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,100
The question is, is there a nice way to figure out how far you've travelled during that

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,960
time based only on your view of the speedometer?

18
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,300
Or better yet, can you find a distance function, s of t, that tells you how far you've travelled

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,580
after a given amount of time, t, somewhere between 0 and 8 seconds?

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,460
Let's say you take note of the velocity at every second, and make a plot over time

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,100
that looks something like this.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,640
And maybe you find that a nice function to model that velocity over time in meters per

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,540
second is v of t equals t times 8 minus t.

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,800
You might remember, in chapter 2 of this series we were looking at the opposite situation,

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,720
where you knew what a distance function was, s of t, and you wanted to figure out the velocity

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
function from that.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,860
There I showed how the derivative of a distance vs. time function gives you a velocity vs.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,600
time function.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,060
So in our current situation, where all we know is velocity, it should make sense that

30
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,180
finding a distance vs. time function is going to come down to asking what function has a

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,340
derivative of t times 8 minus t.

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,420
This is often described as finding the antiderivative of a function, and indeed, that's what we'll

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,300
end up doing, and you could even pause right now and try that.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,100
But first, I want to spend the bulk of this video showing how this question is related

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,320
to finding the area bounded by the velocity graph, because that helps to build an intuition

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,180
for a whole class of problems, things called integral problems in math and science.

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,780
To start off, notice that this question would be a lot easier if the car was just moving

38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,740
at a constant velocity, right?

39
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,100
In that case, you could just multiply the velocity in meters per second times the amount

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,940
of time that has passed in seconds, and that would give you the number of meters traveled.

41
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,160
And notice, you can visualize that product, that distance, as an area.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,820
And if visualizing distance as area seems kind of weird, I'm right there with you.

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,480
It's just that on this plot, where the horizontal direction has units of seconds, and the vertical

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,100
direction has units of meters per second, units of area just very naturally correspond

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,840
to meters.

46
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,780
But what makes our situation hard is that velocity is not constant, it's incessantly

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,480
changing at every single instant.

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,760
It would even be a lot easier if it only ever changed at a handful of points, maybe staying

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,040
static for the first second, and then suddenly discontinuously jumping to a constant 7 meters

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,620
per second for the next second, and so on, with discontinuous jumps to portions of constant

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,160
velocity.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,720
That would make it uncomfortable for the driver, in fact it's actually physically impossible,

53
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,740
but it would make your calculations a lot more straightforward.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,380
You could just compute the distance traveled on each interval by multiplying the constant

55
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,900
velocity on that interval by the change in time, and then just add all of those up.

56
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,280
So what we're going to do is approximate the velocity function as if it was constant

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,860
on a bunch of intervals, and then, as is common in calculus, we'll see how refining that

58
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,580
approximation leads us to something more precise.

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,740
Here, let's make this a little more concrete by throwing in some numbers.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,140
Chop up the time axis between 0 and 8 seconds into many small intervals, each with some

61
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,040
little width dt, something like 0.25 seconds.

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,920
Consider one of those intervals, like the one between t equals 1 and 1.25.

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,940
In reality, the car speeds up from 7 m per second to about 8.4 m per second during that

64
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,720
time, and you could find those numbers just by plugging in t equals 1 and t equals 1.25

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
to the equation for velocity.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,000
What we want to do is approximate the car's motion as if its velocity was constant on

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,580
that interval.

68
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,120
Again, the reason for doing that is we don't really know how to handle situations other

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,700
than constant velocity ones.

70
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,720
You could choose this constant to be anything between 7 and 8.4.

71
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,240
It actually doesn't matter.

72
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,720
All that matters is that our sequence of approximations, whatever they are, gets better and better

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,040
as dt gets smaller and smaller.

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,020
That treating this car's journey as a bunch of discontinuous jumps in speed between portions

75
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,840
of constant velocity becomes a less-wrong reflection of reality as we decrease the time

76
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,980
between those jumps.

77
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,420
So for convenience, on an interval like this, let's just approximate the speed with whatever

78
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,540
the true car's velocity is at the start of that interval, the height of the graph

79
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,640
above the left side, which in this case is 7.

80
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,480
In this example interval, according to our approximation, the car moves 7 m per second

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,560
times 0.25 seconds.

82
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,780
That's 1.75 meters, and it's nicely visualized as the area of this thin rectangle.

83
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,440
In truth, that's a little under the real distance traveled, but not by much.

84
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,920
The same goes for every other interval.

85
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,060
The approximated distance is v of t times dt, it's just that you'd be plugging in

86
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,840
a different value for t at each one of these, giving a different height for each rectangle.

87
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm going to write out an expression for the sum of the areas of all those rectangles

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,340
in kind of a funny way.

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,040
Take this symbol here, which looks like a stretched s for sum, and put a 0 at its bottom

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,440
and an 8 at its top, to indicate that we'll be ranging over time steps between 0 and 8

91
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,000
seconds.

92
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,400
And as I said, the amount we're adding up at each time step is v of t times dt.

93
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
Two things are implicit in this notation.

94
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,340
First of all, that value dt plays two separate roles.

95
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,380
Not only is it a factor in each quantity we're adding up, it also indicates the spacing between

96
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,780
each sampled time step.

97
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,440
So when you make dt smaller and smaller, even though it decreases the area of each rectangle,

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,520
it increases the total number of rectangles whose areas we're adding up, because if

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,740
they're thinner, it takes more of them to fill that space.

100
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,580
And second, the reason we don't use the usual sigma notation to indicate a sum is

101
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,860
that this expression is technically not any particular sum for any particular choice of

102
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,260
dt.

103
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,420
It's meant to express whatever that sum approaches as dt approaches 0.

104
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,980
And as you can see, what that approaches is the area bounded by this curve and the horizontal

105
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,460
axis.

106
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,760
Remember, smaller choices of dt indicate closer approximations for the original question,

107
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,740
how far does the car actually go?

108
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,480
So this limiting value for the sum, the area under this curve, gives us the precise answer

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,260
to the question in full unapproximated precision.

110
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,540
Now tell me that's not surprising.

111
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,740
We had this pretty complicated idea of approximations that can involve adding up a huge number of

112
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,760
very tiny things.

113
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,620
And yet, the value that those approximations approach can be described so simply, it's

114
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,560
just the area underneath this curve.

115
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,460
This expression is called an integral of v of t, since it brings all of its values together,

116
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
it integrates them.

117
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,820
Now at this point, you could say, how does this help?

118
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,660
You've just reframed one hard question, finding how far the car has traveled, into

119
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,440
an equally hard problem, finding the area between this graph and the horizontal axis.

120
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,780
And you'd be right.

121
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,360
If the velocity-distance duo was the only thing we cared about, most of this video,

122
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,240
with all the area under a curve nonsense, would be a waste of time.

123
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,260
We could just skip straight ahead to finding an antiderivative.

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,380
But finding the area between a function's graph and the horizontal axis is somewhat

125
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,840
of a common language for many disparate problems that can be broken down and approximated as

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,240
the sum of a large number of small things.

127
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,940
You'll see more in the next video, but for now I'll just say in the abstract that understanding

128
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,480
how to interpret and how to compute the area under a graph is a very general problem-solving

129
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,940
tool.

130
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,820
In fact, the first video of this series already covered the basics of how this works, but

131
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,900
now that we have more of a background with derivatives, we can take this idea to its

132
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,320
completion.

133
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,580
For a velocity example, think of this right endpoint as a variable, capital T.

134
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,400
So we're thinking of this integral of the velocity function between 0 and T, the area

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,220
under this curve between those inputs, as a function where the upper bound is the variable.

136
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,900
That area represents the distance the car has travelled after T seconds, right?

137
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,280
So in reality, this is a distance vs. time function, s of t.

138
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,820
Now ask yourself, what is the derivative of that function?

139
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,500
On the one hand, a tiny change in distance over a tiny change in time is velocity, that

140
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,020
is what velocity means.

141
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,460
But there's another way to see this, purely in terms of this graph and this area, which

142
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,180
generalizes a lot better to other integral problems.

143
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,740
A slight nudge of dt to the input causes that area to increase, some little ds represented

144
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,700
by the area of this sliver.

145
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,980
The height of that sliver is the height of the graph at that point, v of t, and its width

146
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,940
is dt.

147
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,600
And for small enough dt, we can basically consider that sliver to be a rectangle, so

148
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,680
this little bit of added area, ds, is approximately equal to v of t times dt.

149
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,020
And because that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller dt, the

150
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:03,380
derivative of that area function, ds, dt, at this point equals vt, the value of the

151
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,060
velocity function at whatever time we started on.

152
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,260
And that right there is a super general argument.

153
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,560
The derivative of any function giving the area under a graph like this is equal to the

154
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,540
function for the graph itself.

155
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,440
So, if our velocity function is t times 8-t, what should s be?

156
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,700
What function of t has a derivative of t times 8-t?

157
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,780
It's easier to see if we expand this out, writing it as 8t minus t squared, and then

158
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,680
we can just take each part one at a time.

159
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,920
What function has a derivative of 8t?

160
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,540
We know that the derivative of t squared is 2t, so if we just scale that up by a factor

161
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,300
of 4, we can see that the derivative of 4t squared is 8t.

162
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,880
And for that second part, what kind of function do you think might have negative t squared

163
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,560
as a derivative?

164
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,580
Using the power rule again, we know that the derivative of a cubic term, t cubed, gives

165
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,780
us a square term, 3t squared.

166
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,580
So if we just scale that down by a third, the derivative of 1 third t cubed is exactly

167
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,220
t squared.

168
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,480
And then making that negative, we'd see that negative 1 third t cubed has a derivative

169
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,020
of negative t squared.

170
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:29,880
Therefore, the antiderivative of our function, 8t minus t squared, is 4t squared minus 1

171
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,920
third t cubed.

172
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,160
But there's a slight issue here.

173
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,400
We could add any constant we want to this function, and its derivative is still 8t minus

174
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,020
t squared.

175
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,500
The derivative of a constant always goes to zero.

176
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,060
And if you were to graph s of t, you could think of this in the sense that moving a graph

177
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,820
of a distance function up and down does nothing to affect its slope at every input.

178
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,120
So in reality, there's actually infinitely many different possible antiderivative functions,

179
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:07,100
and every one of them looks like 4t squared minus 1 third t cubed plus c, for some constant

180
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,540
c.

181
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,300
But there is one piece of information we haven't used yet that will let us zero in on which

182
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,160
antiderivative to use, the lower bound of the integral.

183
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,260
This integral has to be zero when we drag that right endpoint all the way to the left

184
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,220
endpoint, right?

185
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,380
The distance travelled by the car between 0 seconds and 0 seconds is… well, zero.

186
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,240
So as we found, the area as a function of capital T is an antiderivative for the stuff

187
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,720
inside.

188
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,280
And to choose what constant to add to this expression, you subtract off the value of

189
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,160
that antiderivative function at the lower bound.

190
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,940
If you think about it for a moment, that ensures that the integral from the lower bound to

191
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,600
itself will indeed be zero.

192
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,240
As it so happens, when you evaluate the function we have here at t equals zero, you get zero.

193
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,220
So in this specific case, you don't need to subtract anything off.

194
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,260
For example, the total distance travelled during the full 8 seconds is this expression

195
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,940
evaluated at t equals 8, which is 85.33 minus 0.

196
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,060
So the answer as a whole is 85.33.

197
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,460
But a more typical example would be something like the integral between 1 and 7.

198
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
That's the area pictured here, and it represents the distance travelled between 1 second and

199
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,020
7 seconds.

200
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,220
What you do is evaluate the antiderivative we found at the top bound, 7, and subtract

201
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,680
off its value at the bottom bound, 1.

202
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,160
Notice, by the way, it doesn't matter which antiderivative we chose here.

203
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,840
If for some reason it had a constant added to it, like 5, that constant would cancel

204
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,560
out.

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,100
More generally, any time you want to integrate some function, and remember, you think of

206
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,200
that as adding up values f of x times dx for inputs in a certain range, and then asking

207
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,840
what is that sum approach as dx approaches 0.

208
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,420
The first step to evaluating that integral is to find an antiderivative, some other function,

209
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,540
capital F, whose derivative is the thing inside the integral.

210
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,920
Then the integral equals this antiderivative evaluated at the top bound minus its value

211
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,940
at the bottom bound.

212
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,460
And this fact right here that you're staring at is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,260
And I want you to appreciate something kind of crazy about this fact.

214
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,700
The integral, the limiting value for the sum of all these thin rectangles, takes into account

215
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,860
every single input on the continuum, from the lower bound to the upper bound.

216
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,840
That's why we use the word integrate, it brings them all together.

217
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,360
And yet, to actually compute it using an antiderivative, you only look at two inputs, the top bound

218
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,580
and the bottom bound.

219
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,560
It almost feels like cheating.

220
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,220
Finding the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all the information needed to add up the

221
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,140
values between those two bounds.

222
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,340
That's just crazy to me.

223
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,600
This idea is deep, and there's a lot packed into this whole concept, so let's recap

224
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,400
everything that just happened, shall we?

225
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,580
We wanted to figure out how far a car goes just by looking at the speedometer.

226
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,220
And what makes that hard is that velocity is always changing.

227
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,640
If you approximate velocity to be constant on multiple different intervals, you could

228
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,480
figure out how far the car goes on each interval with multiplication, and then add all of those up.

229
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Better and better approximations for the original problem correspond to collections of rectangles

230
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,180
whose aggregate area is closer and closer to being the area under this curve between

231
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,980
the start time and the end time.

232
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,560
So that area under the curve is actually the precise distance traveled for the true nowhere

233
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,140
constant velocity function.

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,000
If you think of that area as a function itself, with a variable right endpoint, you can deduce

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,660
that the derivative of that area function must equal the height of the graph at every point.

236
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,760
And that's really the key right there.

237
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,960
It means that to find a function giving this area, you ask, what function has v of t as

238
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,400
a derivative?

239
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,300
There are actually infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function, since you can always

240
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,400
just add some constant without affecting the derivative, so you account for that by subtracting

241
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,100
off the value of whatever antiderivative function you choose at the bottom bound.

242
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,980
By the way, one important thing to bring up before we leave is the idea of negative area.

243
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,540
What if the velocity function was negative at some point, meaning the car goes backwards?

244
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:04,320
It's still true that a tiny distance traveled ds on a little time interval is about equal

245
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,080
to the velocity at that time multiplied by the tiny change in time.

246
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,820
It's just that the number you'd plug in for velocity would be negative, so the tiny

247
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,720
change in distance is negative.

248
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,220
In terms of our thin rectangles, if a rectangle goes below the horizontal axis, like this,

249
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,460
its area represents a bit of distance traveled backwards, so if what you want in the end

250
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,040
is to find a distance between the car's start point and its end point, this is something

251
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,100
you'll want to subtract.

252
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,840
And that's generally true of integrals.

253
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,240
Whenever a graph dips below the horizontal axis, the area between that portion of the

254
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,980
graph and the horizontal axis is counted as negative.

255
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,380
What you'll commonly hear is that integrals don't measure area per se, they measure

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,180
the signed area between the graph and the horizontal axis.

257
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,020
Next up, I'm going to bring up more context where this idea of an integral and area under

258
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,760
curves comes up, along with some other intuitions for this fundamental theorem of calculus.

259
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,540
Maybe you remember, chapter 2 of this series introducing the derivative was sponsored by

260
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,100
The Art of Problem Solving, so I think there's something elegant to the fact that this video,

261
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,420
which is kind of a duel to that one, was also supported in part by The Art of Problem Solving.

262
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,220
I really can't imagine a better sponsor for this channel, because it's a company

263
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,160
whose books and courses I recommend to people anyway.

264
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,040
They were highly influential to me when I was a student developing a love for creative

265
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,920
math, so if you're a parent looking to foster your own child's love for the subject, or

266
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,900
if you're a student who wants to see what math has to offer beyond rote schoolwork,

267
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,120
I cannot recommend The Art of Problem Solving enough.

268
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,400
Whether that's their newest development to build the right intuitions in elementary

269
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,780
school kids, called Beast Academy, or their courses in higher-level topics and contest

270
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:02,500
preparation, going to aops.com slash 3blue1brown, or clicking on the link in the description,

271
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,800
lets them know you came from this channel, which may encourage them to support future

272
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,200
projects like this one.

273
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,320
I consider these videos a success not when they teach people a particular bit of math,

274
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,520
which can only ever be a drop in the ocean, but when they encourage people to go and explore

275
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,000
that expanse for themselves, and The Art of Problem Solving is among the few great places

276
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,120
to actually do that exploration.
