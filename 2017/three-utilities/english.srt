1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
It's the holiday season, a time of year to bring people together and to do something

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,240
a little bit different.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
So...

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Mythologer here.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,440
I'm Matt Parker from Stand Up Maths.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,160
Hey, this is Sam from Wendover Productions and Half as Interesting.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,400
Hi everyone, this is James Grime from the Singing Bin Honor channel.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,160
What's Brady reporting for service from Numberphile, Objectivity and various other channels.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,800
Hey everyone, my name is Stephen Welch, my channel is Welch Labs.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm from the channel Looking Glass Universe.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,000
Grant told me he was sending me a puzzle and a mug.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Hey Grant, I am here.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,640
I've got a mug and some paper and some markers and I'm ready to do your puzzle.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,320
I really should know how to solve this mug because I'm the guy that makes and sells them

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
with Matt Parker.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,560
So I've been instructed not to read the directions before starting.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Hi Ben.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Hi Grant.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,800
So, a friend just gave me this mug.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,380
You are going to be challenged and I'm just going to kind of make you do this on camera

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,940
to embarrass you.

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,580
We've got three different houses here, three different cottages and then three different

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,020
utilities, the gas, the power and the water.

24
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,140
Draw a line from each of the three utilities to each of the three houses, so nine lines

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,140
in total.

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,140
Okay, without letting any two cross.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,620
No two lines cross.

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,500
So right here, if you wanted to just go straight from power to the house, that's a new go, right?

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Okay, interesting.

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,620
That is quite the challenge.

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,820
So nine lines that don't cross.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,660
That doesn't even sound possible.

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,180
I've got my mug.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,060
Got my utilities mug here.

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,180
Okay, so here it is.

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,860
Here's my handmade mug.

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,340
I've even got real coffee in the mug.

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,340
I mean that, look at that.

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
That's attention to detail.

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,580
I'm willing to give this a go.

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm just worried I'm going to muck it up.

42
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,060
I tend to make a bit of a parker square of these things when I, oop, when I try, ah,

43
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,060
see?

44
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,140
Well, let's just fill in as many as I can and see what happens.

45
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,680
Sure this will end terribly.

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,660
So there's one.

47
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
There's the other.

48
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,420
Here we go.

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,420
Gas line.

50
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
It's going to be easy.

51
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,100
We're going to go like this.

52
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,520
Sound effects are crucial.

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,140
I'm not going to go around the green one.

54
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,860
Don't want to fall for that.

55
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,100
I can do another one and now we're up to five.

56
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,220
We have four to go.

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,660
I'm looking at my display over here.

58
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,500
I should have put it over there, but oh well.

59
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,620
Oh, that should go to the, that should go to the second house.

60
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,100
Okay, I'll put it to the second house.

61
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
This is easy enough.

62
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,380
And so we just need to get from here to there.

63
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,020
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven lines.

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,180
Two to go.

65
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,300
So I have that one connected to that one.

66
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,220
I need that one connected to that one.

67
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,820
Oh, now we get into trouble.

68
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,420
Okay, now I start to see the problem.

69
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,420
And there I have made my fatal error in not paying attention.

70
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,520
I have boxed in this house right here.

71
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,660
As you can see, there's no way to get to it.

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,100
This house needs to get to number one and two.

73
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,420
And that's the problem because we're cut off.

74
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,220
I kind of want to try it on paper.

75
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,100
Okay, it's getting really awkward to draw on a mug.

76
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,460
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

77
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,620
to a piece of paper.

78
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,580
This kind of property that you can make lines go

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,400
from here to here and also all the way around

80
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,480
makes it seem like I should be drawing a sphere.

81
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Something like that.

82
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,140
Okay, let me, I need bigger lines, bigger space.

83
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,140
Now I've just blocked off.

84
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,300
How is this possible?

85
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
This isn't getting anywhere.

86
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,500
Let's try again.

87
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,060
Water I need to the first and second.

88
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,900
What?

89
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,820
Oh, I really messed it up.

90
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,660
Okay.

91
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,940
To make that at least look easier,

92
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,540
I'm going to go around here.

93
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Around, around, around, around, around to two.

94
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,340
Go around the mug with the gas here.

95
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,180
So I'm just going to go all the way around.

96
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,620
I'm going to go around.

97
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,340
Let's go underneath the handle here.

98
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,540
Over, over, over, over, over, over.

99
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,760
So now it's close.

100
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,140
We just need to figure out how to get that red in there.

101
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,860
House number three is all done and good.

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,700
Look at that.

103
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,340
House number three, good to go.

104
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,740
So this house has all three and that house has all three,

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,200
but this one in the middle doesn't have gas.

106
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,940
All right, let me try something new.

107
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,780
Let me just try an experiment here.

108
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,540
Let's, let's be, let's be empirical.

109
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,140
What's really nice about the mug is that it's shiny.

110
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,300
So if you use a dry erase marker,

111
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
you can undo your mistakes.

112
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,860
You just rub it off.

113
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,300
Pause it.

114
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,140
Okay, so there's some very pleasing math within this puzzle

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,580
for you and me to dive into.

116
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,540
But first let me just say a really big thanks

117
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,180
to everyone here who was willing to be my guinea pigs

118
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,540
in this experiment.

119
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,620
Each of them runs a channel that I respect a lot.

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,660
And many of them have been incredibly kind

121
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,220
and helpful to this channel.

122
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,420
So if there's any there that you're unfamiliar with

123
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,180
or that you haven't been keeping track with,

124
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,540
they're all listed in the description.

125
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,660
So most certainly check them out.

126
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,900
We'll get back to all of them in just a minute.

127
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,500
Here's the thing about the puzzle.

128
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,460
If you try it on a piece of paper,

129
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,180
you're gonna have a bad time.

130
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,540
But if you're a mathematician at heart,

131
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,100
when a puzzle seems hard,

132
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,340
you don't just throw up your hands and walk away.

133
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,140
Instead, you try to solve a meta puzzle of sorts.

134
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,980
See if you can prove that the task

135
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,500
in front of you is impossible.

136
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,380
In this case, how on earth do you do that?

137
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,460
How do you prove something is impossible?

138
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,500
For background, any time that you have some objects

139
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,860
with a notion of connection between those objects,

140
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,580
it's called a graph, often represented abstractly

141
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,380
with dots for your objects, which I'll call vertices,

142
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,940
and lines for your connections, which I'll call edges.

143
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,980
Now in most applications,

144
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,580
the way you draw a graph doesn't matter.

145
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,220
What matters is the connections.

146
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,180
But in some peculiar cases like this one,

147
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,500
the thing that we care about is how it's drawn.

148
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,460
And if you can draw a graph in the plane

149
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,100
without crossing its edges, it's called a planar graph.

150
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,980
So the question before us is whether or not

151
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,460
our utilities puzzle graph, which in the lingo

152
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,820
is fancifully called a complete bipartite graph, K33,

153
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,900
is planar or not.

154
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,780
And at this point, there are two kinds of viewers,

155
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,580
those of you who know about Euler's formula

156
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,940
and those who don't.

157
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,100
Those who do might see where this is going.

158
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,140
But rather than pulling out a formula from thin air

159
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,380
and using it to solve the meta puzzle,

160
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,860
I wanna flip things around here

161
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,060
and show how reasoning through this conundrum,

162
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,740
step by step, can lead you to rediscovering

163
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,140
a very charming and very general piece of math.

164
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,860
To start, as you're drawing lines here

165
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,660
between homes and utilities,

166
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,940
one really important thing to keep note of

167
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,500
is whenever you enclose a new region.

168
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,140
That is, some area that the paint bucket tool would fill in.

169
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,500
Because you see, once you've enclosed a region like that,

170
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,740
no new line that you draw will be able to enter or exit it.

171
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,620
So you have to be careful with these.

172
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,180
In the last video, remember how I mentioned

173
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,260
that a useful problem solving tactic

174
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,780
is to shift your focus onto any new constructs

175
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,980
that you introduce, trying to reframe your problem

176
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,380
around them?

177
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,460
Well, in this case, what can we say about these regions?

178
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,900
Right now, I have up on the screen an incomplete puzzle

179
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,540
where the water is not yet connected to the first house

180
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,340
and it has four separate regions.

181
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,900
But can you say anything about how many regions

182
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,500
a hypothetically complete puzzle would have?

183
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,140
What about the number of edges that each region touches?

184
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,300
What can you say there?

185
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,700
There's lots of questions you might ask

186
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,580
and lots of things you might notice.

187
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,620
And if you're lucky, here's one thing that might pop out.

188
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,140
For a new line that you draw to create a region,

189
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,500
it has to hit a vertex that already has

190
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,900
an edge coming out of it.

191
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,740
Here, think of it like this.

192
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,780
Start by imagining one of your nodes as lit up

193
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,380
while the other five are dim.

194
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,020
And then every time you draw an edge from a lit up vertex

195
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,100
to a dim vertex, light up the new one.

196
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,460
So at first, each new edge lights up one more vertex.

197
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,260
But if you connect to an already lit up vertex,

198
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,100
notice how this closes off a new region.

199
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,180
And this is a very simple way to do it.

200
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,420
You can see how this closes off a new region.

201
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,900
And this gives us a super useful fact.

202
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,540
Each new edge either increases the number

203
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,060
of lit up nodes by one,

204
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,300
or it increases the number of enclosed regions by one.

205
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,580
This fact is something that we can use to figure out

206
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,420
the number of regions that a hypothetical solution

207
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,220
to this would cut the plane into.

208
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,060
Can you see how?

209
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,820
When you start off, there's one node lit up

210
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,540
and one region, all of 2D space.

211
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,540
By the end, we're gonna need to draw nine lines

212
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,860
since each of the three utilities gets connected

213
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,020
to each of the three houses.

214
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,100
Five of those lines are gonna light up

215
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,780
the initially dim vertices.

216
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,820
So the other four lines, each must introduce a new region.

217
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,620
So a hypothetical solution that has turned up

218
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,420
thehew times one node through a difficult Bye� ham die

219
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,140
So, a hypothetical solution would cut the plane into five separate regions.

220
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,100
And you might say, okay, that's a cute fact, but why should that make things impossible?

221
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,700
What's wrong with having five regions?

222
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,380
Well again, take a look at this partially complete graph.

223
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,220
Notice that each region is bounded by four edges.

224
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,340
And in fact, for this graph, you could never have a cycle with fewer than four edges.

225
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,260
Say you start at a house, then the next line has to be to some utility, and then a line

226
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,420
out of that is going to go to another house.

227
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,900
And you can't cycle back to where you started immediately, because you have to go to another

228
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,540
utility before you can get back to that first house.

229
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,620
So all cycles have at least four edges.

230
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,620
And this right here gives us enough to prove the impossibility of our puzzle.

231
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,380
Having five regions, each with a boundary of at least four edges, would require more

232
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,020
edges than we have available.

233
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,900
Here, let me draw a planar graph that's completely different from our utilities puzzle, but useful

234
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,340
for illustrating what five regions with four edges each would imply.

235
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:23,340
If you went through each of these regions and add up the number of edges that it has,

236
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,180
well you end up with 5 times 4, or 20.

237
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,060
And of course, this way over counts the total number of edges in the graph, since each edge

238
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,340
is touching multiple regions.

239
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,260
But in fact, each edge is touching exactly two regions, so this number 20 is precisely

240
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,440
double counting the edges.

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,620
So any graph that cuts the plane into five regions, where each region is touching four

242
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,940
edges, would have to have ten total edges.

243
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,100
But our utilities puzzle has only nine edges available.

244
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,100
So even though we concluded that it would have to cut the plane into five regions, it

245
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,300
would be impossible for it to do that.

246
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,900
So there you go, bada boom bada bang, it is impossible to solve this puzzle on a piece

247
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,580
of paper without intersecting lines.

248
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,260
Tell me that's not a slick proof.

249
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,740
And before getting back to our friends and the mug, it's worth taking a moment to pull

250
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
out a general truth sitting inside of this.

251
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,780
Think back to the key rule where each new edge was introducing either a new vertex by

252
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,420
being drawn to an untouched spot, or it introduced a new enclosed region.

253
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,900
That same logic applies to any planar graph, not just our specific utilities puzzle situation.

254
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,380
In other words, the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of regions

255
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,580
remains unchanged no matter what graph you draw.

256
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,380
Namely, it started at 2, so it always stays at 2.

257
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,620
And this relation, true for any planar graph, is called Euler's characteristic formula.

258
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,140
Historically, by the way, the formula came up in the context of convex polyhedra, like

259
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,340
a cube for example, where the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number

260
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,020
of faces always equals 2.

261
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,620
So when you see it written down, you often see it with an F for faces instead of talking

262
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,700
about regions.

263
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,860
Now before you go thinking of me as some kind of Grinch that sends friends an impossible

264
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,900
puzzle and then makes them film themselves trying to solve it, keep in mind, I didn't

265
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,140
give this puzzle to people on a piece of paper.

266
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,100
And I'm betting the handle has something to do with this.

267
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,020
Otherwise, why would you have brought a mug over here and not a piece of paper?

268
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,740
This is a valid observation.

269
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,140
Ooh, I have one cool idea, maybe.

270
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,460
Use the mug handle to be...

271
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,740
Oh yeah, I think I see it.

272
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Okay.

273
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,060
I feel like it has to do something with the handle, because that's our ability to hop

274
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,740
one line over the other.

275
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:53,180
I'm going to start by, I think, taking advantage of the handle because I think that that is

276
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,540
the key to this.

277
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
You know what?

278
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,980
I think actually a sphere is the wrong thing to be thinking about.

279
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,580
I mean, famously, a mug is topologically the same as a donut.

280
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,660
So to solve this thing, you're going to have to use the torusiness of the mug.

281
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,820
You're going to have to use the handle somehow.

282
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,620
That's the thing that makes this a torus.

283
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:22,460
So let's take the green and go over the handle here.

284
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Okay.

285
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,700
And then the red can kind of come under.

286
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Nice.

287
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
There we go.

288
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
There you go.

289
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I think I did it.

290
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
All right.

291
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Wow.

292
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,580
My approach is to get as far as you can with...

293
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,900
As far as you can as if you were on a plane and then see where you get stuck.

294
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,940
So look, I'm going to draw this to here like that.

295
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,900
And now I've come across a problem because electricity can't be joined to this house.

296
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
This is where you have to use the handle.

297
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,020
So whatever you did, do it again, but go around the handle.

298
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,660
So I'm going to go down here.

299
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:10,420
I'm going to loop underneath, come back around and back to where I started.

300
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,660
And now I'm free to get my electricity through.

301
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,620
I'm going to go over the handle like that.

302
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,620
There we go.

303
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
Bit messy, but there you go.

304
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:25,180
And then I'm going to go on the inside of the handle.

305
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:34,700
Go all the way around the inside of the handle and finally connect to the gas company.

306
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,660
To solve this puzzle, just join the M and there's three more connections to go.

307
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:45,140
Let's just make them one, two, and now we have to connect those two guys, right?

308
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Just watch it.

309
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,780
In through the front door, out through the back door.

310
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Done.

311
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
No intersections.

312
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Maybe you think that's cheating.

313
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,820
Well, so it's a topological puzzle, so it means the relative positions of things don't

314
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
matter.

315
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,260
What that means is we can take this handle and move it here, creating another connection.

316
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,260
Ho, ho, ho.

317
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Oh my God.

318
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Am I done?

319
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Is this over?

320
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,260
I think I might have gotten it.

321
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,260
24 minutes.

322
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Grant, you chose to take 15 minutes.

323
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,620
There you go.

324
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,700
I think I've solved it.

325
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
You're in the success category.

326
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,060
Hard but not impossible.

327
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,420
Hard but not impossible.

328
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,140
This is maybe perhaps not the most elegant solution to this problem.

329
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,020
If I drew this line here, you'll think, oh no, he's blocked that house.

330
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
There's no way to get the gas in.

331
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,740
But this is why it's on a mug, right?

332
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,960
Because if you take the gas line all the way up here to the top, you then take it over

333
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,140
and into the mug.

334
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,640
If you draw the line under the coffee, it wets the pen.

335
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,540
So when the line comes back out again, the pen's not working anymore.

336
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,620
You can go straight across there in and join it up.

337
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,940
And because it wasn't drawing, you haven't had to cross the lines.

338
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Easy.

339
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,200
By the way, funny story.

340
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,840
So I was originally given this mug as a gift and I didn't really know where it came from.

341
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,100
And it was only after I had invited people to be a part of this that I realized the origin

342
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,860
of the mug, MathsGear, is a website run by three of the YouTubers I had just invited,

343
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,740
Matt, James and Steve.

344
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Small world.

345
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,680
Given just how helpful these three guys were in the logistics of a lot of this, really

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,560
the least I could do to thank them is give a small plug for how gift cards from MathsGear

347
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,500
could make a pretty good last minute Christmas present.

348
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,720
Back to the puzzle though, this is one of those things where once you see it, it kind

349
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,820
of feels obvious.

350
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,640
The handle of the mug can basically be used as a bridge to prevent two lines from crossing.

351
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,920
But this raises a really interesting mathematical question.

352
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,120
We just proved that this task is impossible for graphs on a plane.

353
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,800
So where exactly does that proof break down on the surface of a mug?

354
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,840
And I'm actually not going to tell you the answer here.

355
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,240
I want you to think about this on your own.

356
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,900
And I don't just mean saying, oh it's because Euler's formula is different on surfaces

357
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
with a hole.

358
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,840
Really, think about this.

359
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Where specifically does the line of reasoning that I laid out break down when you're working

360
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
on a mug?

361
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,320
I promise you, thinking this through will give you a deeper understanding of math.

362
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,640
Like anyone tackling a tricky problem, you will likely run into walls and moments of

363
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,040
frustration.

364
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,840
But the smartest people I know actively seek out new challenges, even if they're just

365
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
toy puzzles.

366
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,280
They ask new questions, they aren't afraid to start over many times, and they embrace

367
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,780
every moment of failure.

368
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:34,160
So give this and other puzzles an earnest try, and never stop asking questions.

369
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,120
But Grant, I hear you complaining, how am I supposed to practice my problem solving

370
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,920
if I don't have someone shipping me puzzles on topologically interesting shapes?

371
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,520
Well let's close things off by going through a couple puzzles created by this week's

372
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
mathematically oriented sponsor, Brilliant.org.

373
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,920
So here I'm in their intro to problem solving course and going through a particular sequence

374
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
called flipping pairs.

375
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,560
And the rules here seem to be that we can flip adjacent pairs of coins, but we can't

376
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,280
flip them one at a time.

377
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,040
And we are asked, is it possible to get it so that all three coins are gold side up?

378
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,680
Well, clearly I just did it, so yes.

379
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,860
And the next question, we start with a different configuration, have the same rules, and we're

380
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,860
asked the same question, can we get it so that all three of the coins are gold side

381
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
up?

382
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,320
And, you know, there's not really that many degrees of freedom we have here, just two

383
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,540
different spots to click, so you might quickly come to the conclusion that no, you can't.

384
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,860
Even if you don't necessarily know the theoretical reason yet, that's totally fine.

385
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,500
So no, and we kind of move along.

386
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,940
So next, it's kind of showing us every possible starting configuration that there is, and

387
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,780
asking for how many of them can we get it to a point where all three gold coins are

388
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
up?

389
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,700
Obviously, I'm kind of giving away the answer, it's sitting here four on the right, because

390
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,260
I've gone through this before.

391
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,740
But if you want to go through it yourself, this particular quiz has a really nice resolution,

392
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,100
and a lot of others in this course do build up genuinely good problem solving instincts.

393
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,220
So you can go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b to let them know that you came from here,

394
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,280
or even slash 3b1b flipping to jump straight into this quiz.

395
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,700
And you can make an account for free, a lot of what they offer is free, but they also

396
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,360
have a annual subscription service if you want to get the full suite of experiences

397
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,600
that they offer, and I just think they're really good.

398
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,200
I know a couple of the people there, and they're incredibly thoughtful about how they put together

399
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
math explanations.

400
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,120
Water goes to one, and then wraps around to the other, and naively at this point, oh wait,

401
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,920
I've already messed up.

402
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,680
Then from there, water can make its way to cottage number three.

403
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Ah!

404
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm trapped!

405
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,960
I've done this wrong again!
