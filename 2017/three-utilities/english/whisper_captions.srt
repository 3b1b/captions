1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,860
It's the holiday season, a time of year to bring people together and to do something

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,600
a little bit different.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,920
So...

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,560
Mythologer here.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,460
I'm Matt Parker from Stand Up Maths.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,020
Hey, this is Sam from Wendover Productions and Half as Interesting.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,120
Hi everyone, this is James Grime from the Singing Bin Honor channel.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,060
What's Brady reporting for service from Numberphile, Objectivity and various other channels.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,560
Hey everyone, my name is Stephen Welch, my channel is Welch Labs.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm from the channel Looking Glass Universe.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,880
Grant told me he was sending me a puzzle and a mug.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,280
Hey Grant, I am here.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,160
I've got a mug and some paper and some markers and I'm ready to do your puzzle.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,380
I really should know how to solve this mug because I'm the guy that makes and sells them

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,140
with Matt Parker.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,860
So I've been instructed not to read the directions before starting.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,680
Hi Ben.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,440
Hi Grant.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,360
So a friend just gave me this mug.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,400
You are going to be challenged and I'm just going to kind of make you do this on camera

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,160
to embarrass you.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,500
We've got three different houses here, three different cottages and then three different

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,040
utilities, the gas, the power and the water.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,220
Draw a line from each of the three utilities to each of the three houses, so nine lines

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,720
in total.

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,480
Okay, without letting any two cross.

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,440
No two lines cross.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,580
So right here, if you wanted to just go straight from power to the house, that's a new go, right?

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,540
Okay, interesting.

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
That is quite the challenge.

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,640
So nine lines that don't cross.

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,120
That doesn't even sound possible.

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,700
I've got my mug.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,040
I've got my utilities mug here.

35
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,180
Okay, so here it is.

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
Here's my handmade mug.

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,280
I've even got real coffee in the mug.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,120
I mean that, look at that, that's attention to detail.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm willing to give this a go.

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
I'm just worried I'm going to muck it up.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,380
I tend to make a bit of a parker square of these things when I, ooh, when I try, ah, see?

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Let's just fill in as many as I can and see what happens.

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,260
I'm sure this will end terribly.

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,440
So there's one, there's the other.

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,640
Here we go.

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,680
Gas line, it's going to be easy.

47
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,280
We're going to go like this.

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,060
Sound effects are crucial.

49
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm not going to go around the green one.

50
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,180
Don't want to fall for that.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
I can do another one and now we're up to five.

52
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,920
We have four to go.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,680
I'm looking at my display over here.

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,220
I should have put it over there, but oh well.

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,340
Oh, that should go to the second house.

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, I'll put it to the second house.

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,640
Presumably this is easy enough.

58
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,800
So we just need to get from here to there.

59
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,520
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven lines, two to go.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,720
So I have that one connected to that one.

61
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,960
I need that one connected to that one.

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,720
Oh, now we get into trouble.

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,060
Okay, now I start to see the problem.

64
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,360
And there I have made my fatal error in not paying attention.

65
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,380
I have boxed in this house right here.

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,880
As you can see, there's no way to get to it.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,060
Gas needs to get to number one and two.

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
And that's the problem because we're cut off.

69
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,860
I kind of want to try it on paper.

70
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,980
Okay, it's getting really awkward to draw on a mug.

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,320
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to a piece of paper.

72
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,720
This kind of property that you can make lines go from here to here

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,300
and also all the way around makes it seem like I should be drawing a sphere.

74
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,300
Something like that.

75
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,740
Okay, I need bigger lines, bigger space.

76
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,720
Uh...

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,900
Now I've just blocked off.

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,380
How is this possible?

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,320
This isn't getting anywhere.

80
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,500
Let's try again.

81
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,220
Water I need to the first and second.

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,420
What?

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,860
Oh, I really messed it up.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,060
Okay.

85
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,580
To make that at least look easier, I'm going to go around here.

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,320
Around, around, around, around, around to two.

87
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,980
Go around the mug with the gas here.

88
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,180
So I'm just going to go all the way around.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm going to go around.

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,160
Let's go underneath the handle here.

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
Over, over, over, over, over, over.

92
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
So now it's close.

93
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,340
We just need to figure out how to get that red in there.

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,580
House number three is all done and good.

95
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,400
Look at that.

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,900
House number three, good to go.

97
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,540
So this house has all three and that house has all three,

98
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,860
but this one in the middle doesn't have gas.

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,340
All right, let me try something new.

100
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,640
Let me just try an experiment here.

101
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,200
Let's, let's be, let's be empirical.

102
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,020
What's really nice about the mug is that it's shiny.

103
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,800
So if you use a dry erase marker, you can undo your mistakes.

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
You just rub it off.

105
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,000
Pause it.

106
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,300
Okay, so there's some very pleasing math within this puzzle for you and me to dive into.

107
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,900
But first, let me just say a really big thanks to everyone here who was willing to be my guinea pigs in this experiment.

108
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,760
Each of them runs a channel that I respect a lot and many of them have been incredibly kind and helpful to this channel.

109
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,880
So if there's any there that you're unfamiliar with or that you haven't been keeping track with,

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,380
they're all listed in the description, so most certainly check them out.

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,140
We'll get back to all of them in just a minute.

112
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,980
Here's the thing about the puzzle.

113
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,580
If you try it on a piece of paper, you're going to have a bad time.

114
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,800
But if you're a mathematician at heart, when a puzzle seems hard,

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,860
you don't just throw up your hands and walk away.

116
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,680
Instead, you try to solve a meta-puzzle of sorts.

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,400
See if you can prove that the task in front of you is impossible.

118
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,920
In this case, how on earth do you do that? How do you prove something is impossible?

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,700
For background, anytime that you have some objects with a notion of connection between those objects,

120
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,760
it's called a graph, often represented abstractly with dots for your objects,

121
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,020
which I'll call vertices, and lines for your connections, which I'll call edges.

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,780
In most applications, the way you draw a graph doesn't matter. What matters is the connections.

123
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,080
But in some peculiar cases, like this one, the thing that we care about is how it's drawn.

124
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,360
And if you can draw a graph in the plane without crossing its edges, it's called a planar graph.

125
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,460
So the question before us is whether or not our utilities puzzle graph,

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,720
which in the lingo is fancifully called a complete bipartite graph, K3-3, is planar or not.

127
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,480
And at this point, there are two kinds of viewers.

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Those of you who know about Euler's formula and those who don't.

129
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,780
Those who do might see where this is going.

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,580
But rather than pulling out a formula from thin air and using it to solve the meta puzzle,

131
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,720
I want to flip things around here and show how reasoning through this conundrum step by step

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,020
can lead you to rediscovering a very charming and very general piece of math.

133
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,220
To start, as you're drawing lines here between homes and utilities,

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,200
one really important thing to keep note of is whenever you enclose a new region.

135
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,920
That is, some area that the paint bucket tool would fill in.

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,260
Because you see, once you've enclosed a region like that,

137
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,600
no new line that you draw will be able to enter or exit it.

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
So you have to be careful with these.

139
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,880
In the last video, remember how I mentioned that a useful problem solving tactic

140
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,440
is to shift your focus onto any new constructs that you introduce,

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,580
trying to reframe your problem around them?

142
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,800
Well, in this case, what can we say about these regions?

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,720
Right now, I have up on the screen an incomplete puzzle,

144
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,080
where the water is not yet connected to the first house, and it has four separate regions.

145
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,000
But can you say anything about how many regions a hypothetically complete puzzle would have?

146
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,980
What about the number of edges that each region touches?

147
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,040
What can you say there?

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
There's lots of questions you might ask and lots of things you might notice.

149
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,080
And if you're lucky, here's one thing that might pop out.

150
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,740
For a new line that you draw to create a region,

151
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,840
it has to hit a vertex that already has an edge coming out of it.

152
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,580
Here, think of it like this.

153
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,500
Start by imagining one of your nodes as lit up while the other five are dim.

154
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,760
And then every time you draw an edge from a lit up vertex to a dim vertex, light up the new one.

155
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,420
So at first, each new edge lights up one more vertex.

156
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,780
But if you connect to an already lit up vertex, notice how this closes off a new region.

157
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
And this gives us a super useful fact.

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,860
Each new edge either increases the number of lit up nodes by one,

159
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,080
or it increases the number of enclosed regions by one.

160
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,840
This fact is something that we can use to figure out the number of regions

161
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,700
that a hypothetical solution to this would cut the plane into.

162
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,880
Can you see how?

163
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,600
When you start off, there's one node lit up and one region, all of 2D space.

164
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,980
By the end, we're going to need to draw nine lines,

165
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,880
since each of the three utilities gets connected to each of the three houses.

166
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,520
Five of those lines are going to light up the initially dim vertices.

167
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,080
So the other four lines each must introduce a new region.

168
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,020
So a hypothetical solution would cut the plane into five separate regions.

169
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,000
And you might say, okay, that's a cute fact, but why should that make things impossible?

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
What's wrong with having five regions?

171
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,580
Well again, take a look at this partially complete graph.

172
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,920
Notice that each region is bounded by four edges.

173
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,660
And in fact, for this graph, you could never have a cycle with fewer than four edges.

174
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,980
Say you start at a house, then the next line has to be to some utility,

175
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,340
and then a line out of that is going to go to another house,

176
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,300
and you can't cycle back to where you started immediately,

177
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,700
because you have to go to another utility before you can get back to that first house.

178
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,940
So all cycles have at least four edges.

179
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,860
And this right here gives us enough to prove the impossibility of our puzzle.

180
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,000
Having five regions, each with a boundary of at least four edges,

181
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,680
would require more edges than we have available.

182
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,200
Here, let me draw a planar graph that's completely different from our utilities puzzle,

183
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,440
but useful for illustrating what five regions with four edges each would imply.

184
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,580
If you went through each of these regions and add up the number of edges that it has,

185
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,140
well, you end up with five times four, or twenty.

186
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,180
And of course, this way over counts the total number of edges in the graph,

187
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,360
since each edge is touching multiple regions.

188
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,620
But in fact, each edge is touching exactly two regions,

189
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,580
so this number twenty is precisely double counting the edges.

190
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,920
So any graph that cuts the plane into five regions,

191
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,880
where each region is touching four edges, would have to have ten total edges.

192
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,880
But our utilities puzzle has only nine edges available.

193
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,640
So even though we concluded that it would have to cut the plane into five regions,

194
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,720
it would be impossible for it to do that.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
So there you go, bada boom bada bang,

196
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,960
it is impossible to solve this puzzle on a piece of paper without intersecting lines.

197
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,700
Tell me that's not a slick proof.

198
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,120
And before getting back to our friends and the mug,

199
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,940
it's worth taking a moment to pull out a general truth sitting inside of this.

200
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,280
Think back to the key rule where each new edge was introducing either a new vertex

201
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,400
by being drawn to an untouched spot, or it introduced a new enclosed region.

202
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,880
That same logic applies to any planar graph,

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,620
not just our specific utilities puzzle situation.

204
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,320
In other words, the number of vertices minus the number of edges

205
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,120
plus the number of regions remains unchanged, no matter what graph you draw.

206
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,540
Namely, it started at two, so it always stays at two.

207
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,000
And this relation, true for any planar graph, is called Euler's characteristic formula.

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,780
Historically, by the way, the formula came up in the context of convex polyhedra,

209
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,700
like a cube for example, where the number of vertices minus the number of edges

210
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,360
plus the number of faces always equals two.

211
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,840
So when you see it written down, you often see it with an F for faces

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,300
instead of talking about regions.

213
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,560
Now before you go thinking of me as some kind of grinch

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,360
that sends friends an impossible puzzle and then makes them film themselves trying to solve it,

215
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,800
keep in mind, I didn't give this puzzle to people on a piece of paper.

216
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,500
And I'm betting the handle has something to do with this.

217
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:23,900
Okay.

218
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,400
Otherwise, why would you have brought a mug over here and not a piece of paper?

219
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,060
This is a valid observation.

220
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,460
Ooh, I have one cool idea, maybe.

221
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,680
Use the mug handle to be...

222
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,960
Oh yeah, I think I see it. Okay.

223
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,520
I feel like it has to do something with the handle and

224
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,360
because that's our ability to hop one line over the other.

225
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:54,240
I'm gonna start by, I think, taking advantage of the handle because I think that that is the key to this.

226
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,880
You know what?

227
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,920
I think actually a sphere is the wrong thing to be thinking about.

228
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,200
I mean like famously, a mug is topologically the same as a donut.

229
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,780
So to solve this thing, you're gonna have to use the torusiness of the mug.

230
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,960
You're gonna have to use the handle somehow.

231
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,540
That's the thing that makes this a torus.

232
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,380
So let's take the green and go over the handle here.

233
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:22,880
Okay.

234
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,280
And then the red can kind of come under.

235
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,160
Nice.

236
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,920
And there we go.

237
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,580
There you go.

238
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,420
I think I did it.

239
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,840
All right.

240
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,680
Wow.

241
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:40,560
My approach is to get as far as you can with, as far as you can as if you were on a plane

242
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,720
and then see where you get stuck.

243
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,120
So look, I'm gonna draw this to here like that.

244
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,660
And now I've come across a problem because electricity can't be joined to this house.

245
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,560
This is where you have to use the handle.

246
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,880
So whatever you did, do it again, but go around the handle.

247
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,220
So I'm gonna go down here.

248
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm gonna loop underneath, come back around and back to where I started.

249
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,200
And now I'm free to get my electricity through.

250
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm gonna go over the handle like that.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,280
There we go.

252
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,320
Bit messy, but there you go.

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,480
And then I'm gonna go on the inside of the handle.

254
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,020
Go all the way around the inside of the handle.

255
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,300
And finally connect to the gas company.

256
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,520
To solve this puzzle, just join the M and there's three more connections to go.

257
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,760
Let's just make them one, two, and now we have to connect those two guys, right?

258
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,560
Just watch it.

259
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,960
In through the front door, out through the back door.

260
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:49,720
Done.

261
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,400
No intersections.

262
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,720
Maybe you think that's cheating.

263
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,260
Well, so it's a topological puzzle, so it means the relative positions of things don't matter.

264
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,320
What that means is we can take this handle and move it here, creating another connection.

265
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,520
Ho, ho, ho.

266
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,180
Oh my god, am I done?

267
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,840
Is this over?

268
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,400
I think I might have gotten it.

269
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,280
24 minutes.

270
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,540
Grant, you said this would take 15 minutes.

271
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,440
There you go.

272
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,120
I think I've solved it.

273
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,620
You're in the success category.

274
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,800
Hard but not impossible.

275
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,860
Hard but not impossible.

276
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,360
This is maybe perhaps not the most elegant solution to this problem.

277
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,880
If I drew this line here, you'll think, oh no, he's blocked that house.

278
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,380
There's no way to get the gas in, but this is why it's on a mug, right?

279
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,080
Because if you take the gas line all the way up here to the top,

280
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,680
you then take it over and into the mug.

281
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,240
If you draw the line under the coffee, it wets the pen.

282
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,040
So when the line comes back out again, the pen's not working anymore.

283
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,280
You can go straight across there in and join it up,

284
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
and because it wasn't drawing, you haven't had to cross the lines.

285
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,260
Easy.

286
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,820
By the way, funny story.

287
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,460
So I was originally given this mug as a gift, and I didn't really know where it came from.

288
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,460
And it was only after I had invited people to be a part of this

289
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,500
that I realized the origin of the mug, MathsGear,

290
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,060
is a website run by three of the YouTubers I had just invited, Matt, James, and Steve.

291
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,100
Small world.

292
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,180
Given just how helpful these three guys were in the logistics of a lot of this,

293
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,420
really the least I could do to thank them is give a small plug for how

294
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,640
gift cards from MathsGear could make a pretty good last minute Christmas present.

295
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,480
Back to the puzzle though, this is one of those things where

296
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,400
once you see it, it kind of feels obvious.

297
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,760
The handle of the mug can basically be used as a bridge to prevent two lines from crossing.

298
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,180
But this raises a really interesting mathematical question.

299
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,460
We just proved that this task is impossible for graphs on a plane.

300
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,560
So where exactly does that proof break down on the surface of a mug?

301
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,620
And I'm actually not going to tell you the answer here.

302
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,780
I want you to think about this on your own.

303
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,220
And I don't just mean saying,

304
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
oh it's because Euler's formula is different on surfaces with a hole.

305
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,200
Really, think about this.

306
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,620
Where specifically does the line of reasoning that I laid out

307
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,660
break down when you're working on a mug?

308
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,100
I promise you, thinking this through will give you a deeper understanding of math.

309
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,900
Like anyone tackling a tricky problem,

310
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,220
you will likely run into walls and moments of frustration.

311
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,900
But the smartest people I know actively seek out new challenges,

312
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,580
even if they're just toy puzzles.

313
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,260
They ask new questions, they aren't afraid to start over many times,

314
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,340
and they embrace every moment of failure.

315
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,840
So give this and other puzzles an earnest try, and never stop asking questions.

316
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,500
But Grant, I hear you complaining,

317
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,800
how am I supposed to practice my problem solving

318
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,440
if I don't have someone shipping me puzzles on topologically interesting shapes?

319
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,320
Well, let's close things off by going through a couple puzzles

320
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,840
created by this week's mathematically oriented sponsor, brilliant.org.

321
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,440
So here I'm in their intro to problem solving course

322
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,080
and going through a particular sequence called flipping pairs.

323
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,040
And the rules here seem to be that we can flip adjacent pairs of coins,

324
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,720
but we can't flip them one at a time.

325
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,760
And we are asked, is it possible to get it so that all three coins are gold side up?

326
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,440
Well, clearly I just did it, so yes.

327
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,240
And the next question, we start with a different configuration,

328
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,580
have the same rules, and we're asked the same question,

329
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,220
can we get it so that all three of the coins are gold side up?

330
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,980
And, you know, there's not really that many degrees of freedom we have here,

331
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,380
just two different spots to click,

332
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
so you might quickly come to the conclusion that no, you can't.

333
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,420
Even if you don't necessarily know the theoretical reason yet, that's totally fine.

334
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,600
So no, and we kind of move along.

335
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,520
So next, it's kind of showing us every possible starting configuration that there is,

336
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,180
and asking for how many of them can we get it to a point where all three gold coins are up?

337
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,760
Obviously, I'm kind of giving away the answer,

338
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,720
it's sitting here four on the right, because I've gone through this before.

339
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,260
But if you want to go through it yourself,

340
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,400
this particular quiz has a really nice resolution,

341
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,040
and a lot of others in this course do build up genuinely good problem solving instincts.

342
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,720
So you can go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b to let them know that you came from here,

343
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,500
or even slash 3b1b flipping to jump straight into this quiz.

344
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,940
And you can make an account for free, a lot of what they offer is free,

345
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,560
but they also have a annual subscription service,

346
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,960
if you want to get the full suite of experiences that they offer.

347
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
And I just think they're really good.

348
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,780
I know a couple of the people there,

349
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,140
and they're incredibly thoughtful about how they put together math explanations.

350
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,800
Water goes to one, and then wraps around to the other.

351
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,880
And naively at this point...

352
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,040
Oh, wait, I've already messed up.

353
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,340
Then from there, water can make its way to cottage number three.

354
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Ah, I'm trapped!

355
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,940
I've done this wrong again.
