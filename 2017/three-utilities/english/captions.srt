1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,356
It's the holiday season, a time of year to bring people 

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:08,600
together and to do something a little bit different.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,920
So...

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,560
Mythologer here.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,460
I'm Matt Parker from Stand Up Maths.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,020
Hey, this is Sam from Wendover Productions and Half as Interesting.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,120
Hi everyone, this is James Grime from the Singing Bin Honor channel.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,084
What's Brady reporting for service from Numberphile, 

9
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:25,060
Objectivity and various other channels.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,560
Hey everyone, my name is Stephen Welch, my channel is Welch Labs.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm from the channel Looking Glass Universe.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,880
Grant told me he was sending me a puzzle and a mug.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,280
Hey Grant, I am here.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,160
I've got a mug and some paper and some markers and I'm ready to do your puzzle.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,306
I really should know how to solve this mug because 

16
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,140
I'm the guy that makes and sells them with Matt Parker.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,860
So I've been instructed not to read the directions before starting.

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,680
Hi Ben.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,440
Hi Grant.

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,360
So a friend just gave me this mug.

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,426
You are going to be challenged and I'm just going to 

22
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:58,160
kind of make you do this on camera to embarrass you.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,854
We've got three different houses here, three different cottages 

24
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,040
and then three different utilities, the gas, the power and the water.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,762
Draw a line from each of the three utilities to each of the three houses, 

26
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:09,720
so nine lines in total.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,480
Okay, without letting any two cross.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,440
No two lines cross.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,465
So right here, if you wanted to just go straight from power to the house, 

30
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:19,580
that's a new go, right?

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,540
Okay, interesting.

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
That is quite the challenge.

33
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,640
So nine lines that don't cross.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,120
That doesn't even sound possible.

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,700
I've got my mug.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,040
I've got my utilities mug here.

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,180
Okay, so here it is.

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
Here's my handmade mug.

39
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,280
I've even got real coffee in the mug.

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,120
I mean that, look at that, that's attention to detail.

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm willing to give this a go.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
I'm just worried I'm going to muck it up.

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,380
I tend to make a bit of a parker square of these things when I, ooh, when I try, ah, see?

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Let's just fill in as many as I can and see what happens.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,260
I'm sure this will end terribly.

46
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,440
So there's one, there's the other.

47
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,640
Here we go.

48
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,680
Gas line, it's going to be easy.

49
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,280
We're going to go like this.

50
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,060
Sound effects are crucial.

51
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm not going to go around the green one.

52
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,180
Don't want to fall for that.

53
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
I can do another one and now we're up to five.

54
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,919
We have four to go.

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,680
I'm looking at my display over here.

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,220
I should have put it over there, but oh well.

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,340
Oh, that should go to the second house.

58
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, I'll put it to the second house.

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,640
Presumably this is easy enough.

60
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,800
So we just need to get from here to there.

61
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,520
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven lines, two to go.

62
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,720
So I have that one connected to that one.

63
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,960
I need that one connected to that one.

64
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,720
Oh, now we get into trouble.

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,060
Okay, now I start to see the problem.

66
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,360
And there I have made my fatal error in not paying attention.

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,380
I have boxed in this house right here.

68
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,880
As you can see, there's no way to get to it.

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,060
Gas needs to get to number one and two.

70
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
And that's the problem because we're cut off.

71
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,860
I kind of want to try it on paper.

72
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,980
Okay, it's getting really awkward to draw on a mug.

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,320
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to a piece of paper.

74
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,922
This kind of property that you can make lines go from here to here and 

75
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:13,300
also all the way around makes it seem like I should be drawing a sphere.

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,300
Something like that.

77
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,740
Okay, I need bigger lines, bigger space.

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,720
Uh...

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,900
Now I've just blocked off.

80
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,380
How is this possible?

81
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,320
This isn't getting anywhere.

82
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,500
Let's try again.

83
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,220
Water I need to the first and second.

84
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,420
What?

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,860
Oh, I really messed it up.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,060
Okay.

87
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,580
To make that at least look easier, I'm going to go around here.

88
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,320
Around, around, around, around, around to two.

89
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,980
Go around the mug with the gas here.

90
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,180
So I'm just going to go all the way around.

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm going to go around.

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,160
Let's go underneath the handle here.

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
Over, over, over, over, over, over.

94
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
So now it's close.

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,340
We just need to figure out how to get that red in there.

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,580
House number three is all done and good.

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,400
Look at that.

98
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,900
House number three, good to go.

99
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,667
So this house has all three and that house has all three, 

100
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,860
but this one in the middle doesn't have gas.

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,340
All right, let me try something new.

102
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,640
Let me just try an experiment here.

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,200
Let's, let's be, let's be empirical.

104
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,020
What's really nice about the mug is that it's shiny.

105
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,800
So if you use a dry erase marker, you can undo your mistakes.

106
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
You just rub it off.

107
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,000
Pause it.

108
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,300
Okay, so there's some very pleasing math within this puzzle for you and me to dive into.

109
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,053
But first, let me just say a really big thanks to everyone 

110
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,900
here who was willing to be my guinea pigs in this experiment.

111
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,213
Each of them runs a channel that I respect a lot and many of 

112
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:46,760
them have been incredibly kind and helpful to this channel.

113
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,841
So if there's any there that you're unfamiliar with or that you haven't been keeping 

114
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:54,380
track with, they're all listed in the description, so most certainly check them out.

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,140
We'll get back to all of them in just a minute.

116
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,980
Here's the thing about the puzzle.

117
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,580
If you try it on a piece of paper, you're going to have a bad time.

118
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,814
But if you're a mathematician at heart, when a puzzle seems hard, 

119
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:06,860
you don't just throw up your hands and walk away.

120
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,680
Instead, you try to solve a meta-puzzle of sorts.

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,400
See if you can prove that the task in front of you is impossible.

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,340
In this case, how on earth do you do that?

123
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,920
How do you prove something is impossible?

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,276
For background, anytime that you have some objects with a notion of connection between 

125
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:29,522
those objects, it's called a graph, often represented abstractly with dots for your 

126
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:34,020
objects, which I'll call vertices, and lines for your connections, which I'll call edges.

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
In most applications, the way you draw a graph doesn't matter.

128
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,780
What matters is the connections.

129
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,080
But in some peculiar cases, like this one, the thing that we care about is how it's drawn.

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,998
And if you can draw a graph in the plane without crossing its edges, 

131
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:48,360
it's called a planar graph.

132
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,929
So the question before us is whether or not our utilities puzzle graph, 

133
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,825
which in the lingo is fancifully called a complete bipartite graph, K3-3, 

134
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:57,720
is planar or not.

135
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,480
And at this point, there are two kinds of viewers.

136
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Those of you who know about Euler's formula and those who don't.

137
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,780
Those who do might see where this is going.

138
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,235
But rather than pulling out a formula from thin air and using it to solve the meta 

139
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:16,578
puzzle, I want to flip things around here and show how reasoning through this conundrum 

140
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:21,020
step by step can lead you to rediscovering a very charming and very general piece of math.

141
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,908
To start, as you're drawing lines here between homes and utilities, 

142
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:30,200
one really important thing to keep note of is whenever you enclose a new region.

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,920
That is, some area that the paint bucket tool would fill in.

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,755
Because you see, once you've enclosed a region like that, 

145
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:42,600
no new line that you draw will be able to enter or exit it.

146
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
So you have to be careful with these.

147
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,506
In the last video, remember how I mentioned that a useful problem 

148
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:54,490
solving tactic is to shift your focus onto any new constructs that you introduce, 

149
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,580
trying to reframe your problem around them?

150
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,800
Well, in this case, what can we say about these regions?

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,622
Right now, I have up on the screen an incomplete puzzle, 

152
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:07,080
where the water is not yet connected to the first house, and it has four separate regions.

153
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,771
But can you say anything about how many regions 

154
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:15,000
a hypothetically complete puzzle would have?

155
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,980
What about the number of edges that each region touches?

156
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,040
What can you say there?

157
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
There's lots of questions you might ask and lots of things you might notice.

158
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,080
And if you're lucky, here's one thing that might pop out.

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,985
For a new line that you draw to create a region, 

160
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:32,840
it has to hit a vertex that already has an edge coming out of it.

161
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,580
Here, think of it like this.

162
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,500
Start by imagining one of your nodes as lit up while the other five are dim.

163
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,504
And then every time you draw an edge from a lit up vertex to a dim vertex, 

164
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:49,760
light up the new one.

165
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,420
So at first, each new edge lights up one more vertex.

166
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,780
But if you connect to an already lit up vertex, notice how this closes off a new region.

167
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
And this gives us a super useful fact.

168
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,957
Each new edge either increases the number of lit up nodes by one, 

169
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:16,080
or it increases the number of enclosed regions by one.

170
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,286
This fact is something that we can use to figure out the number of 

171
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,700
regions that a hypothetical solution to this would cut the plane into.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,880
Can you see how?

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,600
When you start off, there's one node lit up and one region, all of 2D space.

174
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,024
By the end, we're going to need to draw nine lines, 

175
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:42,880
since each of the three utilities gets connected to each of the three houses.

176
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,520
Five of those lines are going to light up the initially dim vertices.

177
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,080
So the other four lines each must introduce a new region.

178
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,020
So a hypothetical solution would cut the plane into five separate regions.

179
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,000
And you might say, okay, that's a cute fact, but why should that make things impossible?

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
What's wrong with having five regions?

181
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,580
Well again, take a look at this partially complete graph.

182
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,920
Notice that each region is bounded by four edges.

183
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,660
And in fact, for this graph, you could never have a cycle with fewer than four edges.

184
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,970
Say you start at a house, then the next line has to be to some utility, 

185
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,147
and then a line out of that is going to go to another house, 

186
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:47,220
and you can't cycle back to where you started immediately, 

187
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,700
because you have to go to another utility before you can get back to that first house.

188
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,940
So all cycles have at least four edges.

189
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,860
And this right here gives us enough to prove the impossibility of our puzzle.

190
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,061
Having five regions, each with a boundary of at least four edges, 

191
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,680
would require more edges than we have available.

192
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,693
Here, let me draw a planar graph that's completely different from our utilities puzzle, 

193
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,440
but useful for illustrating what five regions with four edges each would imply.

194
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,053
If you went through each of these regions and add up the number of edges that it has, 

195
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:26,140
well, you end up with five times four, or twenty.

196
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,403
And of course, this way over counts the total number of edges in the graph, 

197
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:32,360
since each edge is touching multiple regions.

198
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,774
But in fact, each edge is touching exactly two regions, 

199
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:40,580
so this number twenty is precisely double counting the edges.

200
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,403
So any graph that cuts the plane into five regions, 

201
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:48,880
where each region is touching four edges, would have to have ten total edges.

202
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,880
But our utilities puzzle has only nine edges available.

203
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,861
So even though we concluded that it would have to cut the plane into five regions, 

204
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,720
it would be impossible for it to do that.

205
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,958
So there you go, bada boom bada bang, it is impossible to 

206
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,960
solve this puzzle on a piece of paper without intersecting lines.

207
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,700
Tell me that's not a slick proof.

208
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,496
And before getting back to our friends and the mug, 

209
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,940
it's worth taking a moment to pull out a general truth sitting inside of this.

210
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,939
Think back to the key rule where each new edge was introducing either a new 

211
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:26,400
vertex by being drawn to an untouched spot, or it introduced a new enclosed region.

212
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,092
That same logic applies to any planar graph, not 

213
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:32,620
just our specific utilities puzzle situation.

214
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,839
In other words, the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus 

215
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,120
the number of regions remains unchanged, no matter what graph you draw.

216
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,540
Namely, it started at two, so it always stays at two.

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,000
And this relation, true for any planar graph, is called Euler's characteristic formula.

218
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,204
Historically, by the way, the formula came up in the context of convex polyhedra, 

219
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:01,757
like a cube for example, where the number of vertices minus the number 

220
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:04,360
of edges plus the number of faces always equals two.

221
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,066
So when you see it written down, you often see it 

222
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,300
with an F for faces instead of talking about regions.

223
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,747
Now before you go thinking of me as some kind of grinch that sends friends 

224
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,918
an impossible puzzle and then makes them film themselves trying to solve it, 

225
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,800
keep in mind, I didn't give this puzzle to people on a piece of paper.

226
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,500
And I'm betting the handle has something to do with this.

227
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:23,900
Okay.

228
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,400
Otherwise, why would you have brought a mug over here and not a piece of paper?

229
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,060
This is a valid observation.

230
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,460
Ooh, I have one cool idea, maybe.

231
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,680
Use the mug handle to be...

232
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,740
Oh yeah, I think I see it.

233
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Okay.

234
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,588
I feel like it has to do something with the handle and 

235
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,360
because that's our ability to hop one line over the other.

236
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,089
I'm gonna start by, I think, taking advantage of the 

237
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,240
handle because I think that that is the key to this.

238
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,880
You know what?

239
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,920
I think actually a sphere is the wrong thing to be thinking about.

240
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,200
I mean like famously, a mug is topologically the same as a donut.

241
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,780
So to solve this thing, you're gonna have to use the torusiness of the mug.

242
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,960
You're gonna have to use the handle somehow.

243
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,540
That's the thing that makes this a torus.

244
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,380
So let's take the green and go over the handle here.

245
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:22,880
Okay.

246
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,280
And then the red can kind of come under.

247
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,160
Nice.

248
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,920
And there we go.

249
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,580
There you go.

250
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,420
I think I did it.

251
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,840
All right.

252
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,680
Wow.

253
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,553
My approach is to get as far as you can with, as far as you 

254
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:44,720
can as if you were on a plane and then see where you get stuck.

255
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,120
So look, I'm gonna draw this to here like that.

256
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,660
And now I've come across a problem because electricity can't be joined to this house.

257
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,560
This is where you have to use the handle.

258
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,880
So whatever you did, do it again, but go around the handle.

259
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,220
So I'm gonna go down here.

260
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm gonna loop underneath, come back around and back to where I started.

261
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,200
And now I'm free to get my electricity through.

262
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm gonna go over the handle like that.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,280
There we go.

264
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,320
Bit messy, but there you go.

265
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,480
And then I'm gonna go on the inside of the handle.

266
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,020
Go all the way around the inside of the handle.

267
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,300
And finally connect to the gas company.

268
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,520
To solve this puzzle, just join the M and there's three more connections to go.

269
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,760
Let's just make them one, two, and now we have to connect those two guys, right?

270
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,560
Just watch it.

271
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,960
In through the front door, out through the back door.

272
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:49,720
Done.

273
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,400
No intersections.

274
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,720
Maybe you think that's cheating.

275
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,548
Well, so it's a topological puzzle, so it means 

276
00:14:56,548 --> 00:14:59,260
the relative positions of things don't matter.

277
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,320
What that means is we can take this handle and move it here, creating another connection.

278
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,520
Ho, ho, ho.

279
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,180
Oh my god, am I done?

280
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,840
Is this over?

281
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,400
I think I might have gotten it.

282
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,280
24 minutes.

283
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,540
Grant, you said this would take 15 minutes.

284
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,440
There you go.

285
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,120
I think I've solved it.

286
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,620
You're in the success category.

287
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,800
Hard but not impossible.

288
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,860
Hard but not impossible.

289
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,360
This is maybe perhaps not the most elegant solution to this problem.

290
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,880
If I drew this line here, you'll think, oh no, he's blocked that house.

291
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,380
There's no way to get the gas in, but this is why it's on a mug, right?

292
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,942
Because if you take the gas line all the way up here to the top, 

293
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:42,680
you then take it over and into the mug.

294
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,240
If you draw the line under the coffee, it wets the pen.

295
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,040
So when the line comes back out again, the pen's not working anymore.

296
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,789
You can go straight across there in and join it up, 

297
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:56,280
and because it wasn't drawing, you haven't had to cross the lines.

298
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,260
Easy.

299
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,820
By the way, funny story.

300
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,460
So I was originally given this mug as a gift, and I didn't really know where it came from.

301
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,974
And it was only after I had invited people to be a part of this 

302
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:09,579
that I realized the origin of the mug, MathsGear, 

303
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,060
is a website run by three of the YouTubers I had just invited, Matt, James, and Steve.

304
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,100
Small world.

305
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,062
Given just how helpful these three guys were in the logistics of a lot of this, 

306
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,351
really the least I could do to thank them is give a small plug for how gift 

307
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:25,640
cards from MathsGear could make a pretty good last minute Christmas present.

308
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,424
Back to the puzzle though, this is one of those things where once you see it, 

309
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,400
it kind of feels obvious.

310
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,806
The handle of the mug can basically be used as 

311
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,760
a bridge to prevent two lines from crossing.

312
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,180
But this raises a really interesting mathematical question.

313
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,460
We just proved that this task is impossible for graphs on a plane.

314
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,560
So where exactly does that proof break down on the surface of a mug?

315
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,620
And I'm actually not going to tell you the answer here.

316
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,780
I want you to think about this on your own.

317
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,219
And I don't just mean saying, oh it's because 

318
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:56,500
Euler's formula is different on surfaces with a hole.

319
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,200
Really, think about this.

320
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,190
Where specifically does the line of reasoning that 

321
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,660
I laid out break down when you're working on a mug?

322
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,099
I promise you, thinking this through will give you a deeper understanding of math.

323
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,704
Like anyone tackling a tricky problem, you will 

324
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,220
likely run into walls and moments of frustration.

325
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,963
But the smartest people I know actively seek out new challenges, 

326
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:19,579
even if they're just toy puzzles.

327
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,401
They ask new questions, they aren't afraid to start over many times, 

328
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,339
and they embrace every moment of failure.

329
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,840
So give this and other puzzles an earnest try, and never stop asking questions.

330
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,840
But Grant, I hear you complaining, how am I supposed to practice my problem solving 

331
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,440
if I don't have someone shipping me puzzles on topologically interesting shapes?

332
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,471
Well, let's close things off by going through a couple puzzles 

333
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:47,840
created by this week's mathematically oriented sponsor, brilliant.org.

334
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,760
So here I'm in their intro to problem solving course and 

335
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,080
going through a particular sequence called flipping pairs.

336
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,988
And the rules here seem to be that we can flip adjacent pairs of coins, 

337
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,720
but we can't flip them one at a time.

338
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,760
And we are asked, is it possible to get it so that all three coins are gold side up?

339
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,440
Well, clearly I just did it, so yes.

340
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,149
And the next question, we start with a different configuration, 

341
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,556
have the same rules, and we're asked the same question, 

342
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:15,220
can we get it so that all three of the coins are gold side up?

343
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,193
And, you know, there's not really that many degrees of freedom we have here, 

344
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:22,934
just two different spots to click, so you might quickly come to the conclusion that no, 

345
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:23,360
you can't.

346
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,420
Even if you don't necessarily know the theoretical reason yet, that's totally fine.

347
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,600
So no, and we kind of move along.

348
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,182
So next, it's kind of showing us every possible starting configuration that there is, 

349
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:39,015
and asking for how many of them can we get it to a point where all three gold coins are 

350
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:39,180
up?

351
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,842
Obviously, I'm kind of giving away the answer, 

352
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,720
it's sitting here four on the right, because I've gone through this before.

353
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,741
But if you want to go through it yourself, this particular 

354
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,240
quiz has a really nice resolution, and a lot of others in 

355
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,040
this course do build up genuinely good problem solving instincts.

356
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,141
So you can go to brilliant.org slash 3b1b to let them know that you came from here, 

357
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:01,500
or even slash 3b1b flipping to jump straight into this quiz.

358
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,101
And you can make an account for free, a lot of what they offer is free, 

359
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,214
but they also have a annual subscription service, 

360
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,960
if you want to get the full suite of experiences that they offer.

361
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
And I just think they're really good.

362
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,957
I know a couple of the people there, and they're incredibly 

363
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:16,140
thoughtful about how they put together math explanations.

364
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,800
Water goes to one, and then wraps around to the other.

365
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:23,879
And naively at this point...

366
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,040
Oh, wait, I've already messed up.

367
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,340
Then from there, water can make its way to cottage number three.

368
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Ah, I'm trapped!

369
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,580
I've done this wrong again.
