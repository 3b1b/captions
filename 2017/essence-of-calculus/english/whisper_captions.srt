00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,460
Hey everyone, Grant here.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,720
This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus, and I'll be publishing

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,600
the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,400
The goal here, as the name suggests, is to really get the heart of the subject out in

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,720
one binge-watchable set.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,500
But with a topic that's as broad as calculus, there's a lot of things that can mean, so

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,200
here's what I have in mind specifically.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,940
Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas which are often presented as things to be memorized.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,880
Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule, implicit differentiation,

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,880
the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite, Taylor series, just a lot of things

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,460
like that.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,080
And my goal is for you to come away feeling like you could have invented calculus yourself.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,980
That is, cover all those core ideas, but in a way that makes clear where they actually

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,000
come from, and what they really mean, using an all-around visual approach.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,460
Inventing math is no joke, and there is a difference between being told why something's

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,040
true, and actually generating it from scratch.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,520
But at all points, I want you to think to yourself, if you were an early mathematician,

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,680
pondering these ideas and drawing out the right diagrams, does it feel reasonable that

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,240
you could have stumbled across these truths yourself?

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,740
In this initial video, I want to show how you might stumble into the core ideas of calculus

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,840
by thinking very deeply about one specific bit of geometry, the area of a circle.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,040
Maybe you know that this is pi times its radius squared, but why?

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,460
Is there a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,680
Well, contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring the interesting

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,220
thoughts that come about can actually lead you to a glimpse of three big ideas in calculus,

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,920
integrals, derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,840
But the story starts more simply, just you and a circle, let's say with radius 3.

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,540
You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot of paper trying

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,180
different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area, many of which might lead

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,040
to their own interesting observations, maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,060
into many concentric rings.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,780
This should seem promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle, and math has a

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,460
tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,060
Let's take one of those rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,580
If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one, and if we have

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,500
a nice way to add them all up, it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's area.

37
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,120
Maybe you start by imagining straightening out this ring.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,740
And you could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what its area should be,

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,180
but for simplicity, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,440
The width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring, which is 2 pi times r, right?

41
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,060
I mean, that's essentially the definition of pi.

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,380
And its thickness?

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,900
Well, that depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place, which was

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,620
kind of arbitrary.

45
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,340
In the spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation, let's call that

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,960
thickness dr for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring to the next.

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,880
Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.

48
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,680
So approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle, its area is 2 pi times r,

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,600
the radius, times dr, the little thickness.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,460
And even though that's not perfect, for smaller and smaller choices of dr, this is actually

51
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,460
going to be a better and better approximation for that area, since the top and the bottom

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,600
sides of this shape are going to get closer and closer to being exactly the same length.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,040
So let's just move forward with this approximation, keeping in the back of our minds that it's

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,360
slightly wrong, but it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dr.

55
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,400
That is, if we slice up the circle into thinner and thinner rings.

56
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,100
So just to sum up where we are, you've broken up the area of the circle into all of these

57
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,820
rings, and you're approximating the area of each one of those as 2 pi times its radius

58
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,740
times dr, where the specific value for that inner radius ranges from 0 for the smallest

59
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,080
ring up to just under 3 for the biggest ring, spaced out by whatever the thickness is that

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,980
you choose for dr, something like 0.1.

61
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,220
And notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to the thickness dr of each

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,300
ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.

63
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,120
In fact, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating each ring's area is to fit them

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,820
all upright side by side along this axis.

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,600
Each one has a thickness dr, which is why they fit so snugly right there together, and

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,040
the height of any one of these rectangles sitting above some specific value of r, like

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,000
0.6, is exactly 2 pi times that value.

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,960
That's the circumference of the corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,140
Pictures like this 2 pi r can get tall for the screen, I mean 2 times pi times 3 is around

70
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,080
19, so let's just throw up a y axis that's scaled a little differently so that we can

71
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,180
actually fit all of these rectangles on the screen.

72
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,060
A nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2 pi r, which is a straight

73
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,540
line that has a slope 2 pi.

74
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,800
Each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,460
Again, we're being approximate here.

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Each of these rectangles only approximates the area of the corresponding ring from the

77
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,220
circle.

78
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,300
But remember, that approximation, 2 pi r times dr, gets less and less wrong as the size of

79
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,800
dr gets smaller and smaller.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,560
And this has a very beautiful meaning when we're looking at the sum of the areas of

81
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,540
all those rectangles.

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,460
For smaller and smaller choices of dr, you might at first think that turns the problem

83
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,140
into a monstrously large sum.

84
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,040
I mean, there's many many rectangles to consider, and the decimal precision of each

85
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,200
one of their areas is going to be an absolute nightmare.

86
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,300
But notice, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.

87
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,300
And that portion under the graph is just a triangle, a triangle with a base of 3 and

88
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,400
a height that's 2 pi times 3.

89
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,500
So its area, 1 half base times height, works out to be exactly pi times 3 squared.

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,760
Or if the radius of our original circle was some other value, capital R, that area comes

91
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,660
out to be pi times r squared.

92
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,460
And that's the formula for the area of a circle.

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,020
It doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math, that right there

94
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,380
is a beautiful argument.

95
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,460
But if you want to think like a mathematician here, you don't just care about finding

96
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,920
the answer, you care about developing general problem-solving tools and techniques.

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,640
So take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happened and why it worked, because the

98
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,220
way we transitioned from something approximate to something precise is actually pretty subtle

99
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,780
and cuts deep to what calculus is all about.

100
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,780
You had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers, each of

101
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,060
which looked like 2 pi r times dr, for values of r ranging between 0 and 3.

102
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,160
Remember, the small number dr here represents our choice for the thickness of each ring,

103
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,980
for example 0.1.

104
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,640
And there are two important things to note here.

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,060
First of all, not only is dr a factor in the quantities we're adding up, 2 pi r times

106
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,580
dr, it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.

107
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,520
And secondly, the smaller our choice for dr, the better the approximation.

108
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,820
Adding all of those numbers could be seen in a different, pretty clever way as adding

109
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,020
the areas of many thin rectangles sitting underneath a graph, the graph of the function

110
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,420
2 pi r in this case.

111
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,580
Then, and this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for dr, corresponding

112
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,740
to better and better approximations of the original problem, the sum, thought of as the

113
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,180
aggregate area of those rectangles, approaches the area under the graph.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,400
And because of that, you can conclude that the answer to the original question, in full

115
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,520
unapproximated precision, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.

116
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,960
A lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down and approximated

117
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,040
as the sum of many small quantities, like figuring out how far a car has traveled based

118
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,940
on its velocity at each point in time.

119
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,520
In a case like that, you might range through many different points in time, and at each

120
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,720
one multiply the velocity at that time times a tiny change in time, dt, which would give

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,180
the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that little time.

122
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,340
I'll talk through the details of examples like this later in the series, but at a high

123
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,660
level many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalent to finding the area under

124
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,140
some graph, in much the same way that our circle problem did.

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,540
This happens whenever the quantities you're adding up, the one whose sum approximates

126
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,460
the original problem, can be thought of as the areas of many thin rectangles sitting

127
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,240
side by side.

128
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,000
If finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner and thinner

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,540
rings, then the original problem is equivalent to finding the area under some graph.

130
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,020
Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series, so don't worry

131
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,180
if it's not 100% clear right now.

132
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,860
The point now is that you, as the mathematician having just solved a problem by reframing

133
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,840
it as the area under a graph, might start thinking about how to find the areas under

134
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,520
other graphs.

135
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,520
We were lucky in the circle problem that the relevant area turned out to be a triangle,

136
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,760
but imagine instead something like a parabola, the graph of x2.

137
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,340
What's the area underneath that curve, say between the values of x equals 0 and x equals

138
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,680
3?

139
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,760
Well, it's hard to think about, right?

140
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,020
And let me reframe that question in a slightly different way.

141
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,060
We'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.

142
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,780
Are you able to find a function, a of x, that gives you the area under this parabola between

143
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,180
0 and x?

144
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,580
A function a of x like this is called an integral of x2.

145
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,900
Calculus holds within it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is, but right

146
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,200
now it's just a mystery function to us.

147
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,260
We know it gives the area under the graph of x2 between some fixed left point and some

148
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,920
variable right point, but we don't know what it is.

149
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,380
And again, the reason we care about this kind of question is not just for the sake of asking

150
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,500
hard geometry questions, it's because many practical problems that can be approximated

151
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,960
by adding up a large number of small things can be reframed as a question about an area

152
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,300
under a certain graph.

153
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,300
I'll tell you right now that finding this area, this integral function, is genuinely

154
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,060
hard, and whenever you come across a genuinely hard question in math, a good policy is to

155
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,540
not try too hard to get at the answer directly, since usually you just end up banging your

156
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,340
head against a wall.

157
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,780
Instead, play around with the idea, with no particular goal in mind.

158
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,420
Spend some time building up familiarity with the interplay between the function defining

159
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,360
the graph, in this case x2, and the function giving the area.

160
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,020
In that playful spirit, if you're lucky, here's something you might notice.

161
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,600
When you slightly increase x by some tiny nudge dx, look at the resulting change in

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,420
area, represented with this sliver I'm going to call da for a tiny difference in area.

163
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,320
That sliver can be pretty well approximated with a rectangle, one whose height is x2 and

164
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,620
whose width is dx.

165
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,620
And the smaller the size of that nudge dx, the more that sliver actually looks like a

166
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,020
rectangle.

167
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,080
This gives us an interesting way to think about how a of x is related to x2.

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,300
A change to the output of a, this little da, is about equal to x2, where x is whatever

169
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,000
input you started at, times dx, the little nudge to the input that caused a to change.

170
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,460
Or rearranged, da divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change in a to the tiny change in

171
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,780
x that caused it, is approximately whatever x2 is at that point.

172
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,040
And that's an approximation that should get better and better for smaller and smaller

173
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,960
choices of dx.

174
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,640
In other words, we don't know what a of x is, that remains a mystery.

175
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,500
But we do know a property that this mystery function must have.

176
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,400
When you look at two nearby points, for example 3 and 3.001, consider the change to the output

177
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,640
of a between those two points, the difference between the mystery function evaluated at

178
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,120
3.001 and 3.001.

179
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,040
That change, divided by the difference in the input values, which in this case is 0.001,

180
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,100
should be about equal to the value of x2 for the starting input, in this case 3.001.

181
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,000
And this relationship between tiny changes to the mystery function and the values of

182
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,440
x2 itself is true at all inputs, not just 3.

183
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,640
That doesn't immediately tell us how to find a of x, but it provides a very strong

184
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,820
clue that we can work with.

185
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,740
And there's nothing special about the graph x2 here.

186
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,980
Any function defined as the area under some graph has this property, that da divided by

187
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,480
a slight nudge to the output of a divided by a slight nudge to the input that caused

188
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,500
it, is about equal to the height of the graph at that point.

189
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Again, that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller choices of dx.

190
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,040
And here, we're stumbling into another big idea from calculus, derivatives.

191
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,180
This ratio da divided by dx is called the derivative of a, or more technically, the

192
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,240
derivative of whatever this ratio approaches as dx gets smaller and smaller.

193
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,500
I'll dive much more deeply into the idea of a derivative in the next video, but loosely

194
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,080
speaking it's a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes in its input.

195
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,460
You'll see as the series goes on that there are many ways you can visualize a derivative,

196
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,180
depending on what function you're looking at and how you think about tiny nudges to

197
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,740
its output.

198
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,900
We care about derivatives because they help us solve problems, and in our little exploration

199
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,140
here, we already have a glimpse of one way they're used.

200
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,880
They are the key to solving integral questions, problems that require finding the area under

201
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,420
a curve.

202
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,540
Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives, you'll be able to look at a

203
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,800
situation like this one where you don't know what a function is, but you do know that

204
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,760
its derivative should be x2, and from that reverse engineer what the function must be.

205
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,520
This back and forth between integrals and derivatives, where the derivative of a function

206
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,120
for the area under a graph gives you back the function defining the graph itself, is

207
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,320
called the fundamental theorem of calculus.

208
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,960
It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives, and shows how each one is

209
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
an inverse of the other.

210
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,220
All of this is only a high-level view, just a peek at some of the core ideas that emerge

211
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,860
in calculus.

212
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,420
And what follows in this series are the details, for derivatives and integrals and more.

213
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,920
At all points, I want you to feel that you could have invented calculus yourself, that

214
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,160
if you drew the right pictures and played with each idea in just the right way, these

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,180
formulas and rules and constructs that are presented could have just as easily popped

216
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,260
out naturally from your own explorations.

217
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,220
And before you go, it would feel wrong not to give the people who supported this series

218
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,000
on Patreon a well-deserved thanks, both for their financial backing as well as for the

219
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,860
suggestions they gave while the series was being developed.

220
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,700
You see, supporters got early access to the videos as I made them, and they'll continue

221
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,560
to get early access for future essence-of type series.

222
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,240
And as a thanks to the community, I keep ads off of new videos for their first month.

223
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm still astounded that I can spend time working on videos like these, and in a very

224
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,740
direct way, you are the one to thank for that.
