00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,460
Hey everyone, Grant here.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,875
This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus, 

3
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,600
and I'll be publishing the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,960
The goal here, as the name suggests, is to really get 

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,720
the heart of the subject out in one binge-watchable set.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,224
But with a topic that's as broad as calculus, there's a lot of things that can mean, 

7
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:36,200
so here's what I have in mind specifically.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,466
Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas which 

9
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,940
are often presented as things to be memorized.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,806
Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule, 

11
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:50,031
implicit differentiation, the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite, 

12
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,460
Taylor series, just a lot of things like that.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,178
And my goal is for you to come away feeling like 

14
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,080
you could have invented calculus yourself.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,690
That is, cover all those core ideas, but in a way that makes clear where they 

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,000
actually come from, and what they really mean, using an all-around visual approach.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Inventing math is no joke, and there is a difference between being 

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,040
told why something's true, and actually generating it from scratch.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,141
But at all points, I want you to think to yourself, if you were an early mathematician, 

20
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,082
pondering these ideas and drawing out the right diagrams, 

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,240
does it feel reasonable that you could have stumbled across these truths yourself?

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,627
In this initial video, I want to show how you might stumble into the core ideas of 

23
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:36,840
calculus by thinking very deeply about one specific bit of geometry, the area of a circle.

24
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,040
Maybe you know that this is pi times its radius squared, but why?

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,460
Is there a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,378
Well, contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring the 

27
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:53,597
interesting thoughts that come about can actually lead you to a glimpse of three 

28
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:57,920
big ideas in calculus, integrals, derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,840
But the story starts more simply, just you and a circle, let's say with radius 3.

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,434
You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot of 

31
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:13,537
paper trying different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area, 

32
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,904
many of which might lead to their own interesting observations, 

33
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:21,060
maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle into many concentric rings.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,858
This should seem promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle, 

35
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:29,460
and math has a tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,060
Let's take one of those rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,972
If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one, 

38
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:43,015
and if we have a nice way to add them all up, it might lead 

39
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:45,500
us to an understanding of the full circle's area.

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,120
Maybe you start by imagining straightening out this ring.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,043
And you could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what its 

42
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:59,180
area should be, but for simplicity, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,914
The width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring, 

44
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,440
which is 2 pi times r, right?

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,060
I mean, that's essentially the definition of pi.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,380
And its thickness?

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,201
Well, that depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place, 

48
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,620
which was kind of arbitrary.

49
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,147
In the spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation, 

50
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:24,484
let's call that thickness dr for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring to 

51
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:24,960
the next.

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,880
Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,916
So approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle, 

54
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:37,600
its area is 2 pi times r, the radius, times dr, the little thickness.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,488
And even though that's not perfect, for smaller and smaller choices of dr, 

56
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,533
this is actually going to be a better and better approximation for that area, 

57
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:51,044
since the top and the bottom sides of this shape are going to get closer and closer to 

58
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,600
being exactly the same length.

59
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,979
So let's just move forward with this approximation, 

60
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,747
keeping in the back of our minds that it's slightly wrong, 

61
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:02,360
but it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dr.

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,400
That is, if we slice up the circle into thinner and thinner rings.

63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,445
So just to sum up where we are, you've broken up the area of the circle into 

64
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:17,251
all of these rings, and you're approximating the area of each one of those as 

65
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:22,120
2 pi times its radius times dr, where the specific value for that inner radius 

66
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,865
ranges from 0 for the smallest ring up to just under 3 for the biggest ring, 

67
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:31,980
spaced out by whatever the thickness is that you choose for dr, something like 0.1.

68
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,028
And notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to the 

69
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:41,300
thickness dr of each ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.

70
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,067
In fact, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating each 

71
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:49,820
ring's area is to fit them all upright side by side along this axis.

72
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,882
Each one has a thickness dr, which is why they fit so snugly right there together, 

73
00:04:55,882 --> 00:05:01,294
and the height of any one of these rectangles sitting above some specific value of r, 

74
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:04,000
like 0.6, is exactly 2 pi times that value.

75
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,960
That's the circumference of the corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates.

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,604
Pictures like this 2 pi r can get tall for the screen, 

77
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,977
I mean 2 times pi times 3 is around 19, so let's just throw up a y axis that's 

78
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:21,405
scaled a little differently so that we can actually fit all of these rectangles 

79
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,180
on the screen.

80
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,995
A nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2 pi r, 

81
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,540
which is a straight line that has a slope 2 pi.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,800
Each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,460
Again, we're being approximate here.

84
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,060
Each of these rectangles only approximates the 

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,220
area of the corresponding ring from the circle.

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,308
But remember, that approximation, 2 pi r times dr, 

87
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:50,800
gets less and less wrong as the size of dr gets smaller and smaller.

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,012
And this has a very beautiful meaning when we're 

89
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:56,540
looking at the sum of the areas of all those rectangles.

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,110
For smaller and smaller choices of dr, you might at first 

91
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,140
think that turns the problem into a monstrously large sum.

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I mean, there's many many rectangles to consider, 

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,200
and the decimal precision of each one of their areas is going to be an absolute nightmare.

94
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,300
But notice, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.

95
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,429
And that portion under the graph is just a triangle, 

96
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:23,400
a triangle with a base of 3 and a height that's 2 pi times 3.

97
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,500
So its area, 1 half base times height, works out to be exactly pi times 3 squared.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,195
Or if the radius of our original circle was some other value, 

99
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,660
capital R, that area comes out to be pi times r squared.

100
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,460
And that's the formula for the area of a circle.

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,459
It doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math, 

102
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,380
that right there is a beautiful argument.

103
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,869
But if you want to think like a mathematician here, 

104
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:57,006
you don't just care about finding the answer, you care about developing general 

105
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,920
problem-solving tools and techniques.

106
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,819
So take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happened and why it worked, 

107
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,640
because the way we transitioned from something approximate to something 

108
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,780
precise is actually pretty subtle and cuts deep to what calculus is all about.

109
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,970
You had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers, 

110
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,060
each of which looked like 2 pi r times dr, for values of r ranging between 0 and 3.

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,007
Remember, the small number dr here represents our choice for the thickness of each ring, 

112
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:32,980
for example 0.1.

113
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,640
And there are two important things to note here.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,703
First of all, not only is dr a factor in the quantities we're adding up, 

115
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:45,580
2 pi r times dr, it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.

116
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,520
And secondly, the smaller our choice for dr, the better the approximation.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,255
Adding all of those numbers could be seen in a different, 

118
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:59,996
pretty clever way as adding the areas of many thin rectangles sitting underneath a graph, 

119
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,420
the graph of the function 2 pi r in this case.

120
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,487
Then, and this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for dr, 

121
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,649
corresponding to better and better approximations of the original problem, the sum, 

122
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:18,180
thought of as the aggregate area of those rectangles, approaches the area under the graph.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,533
And because of that, you can conclude that the answer to the original question, 

124
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:28,520
in full unapproximated precision, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.

125
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,075
A lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down 

126
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:38,422
and approximated as the sum of many small quantities, 

127
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:43,940
like figuring out how far a car has traveled based on its velocity at each point in time.

128
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,823
In a case like that, you might range through many different points in time, 

129
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:53,314
and at each one multiply the velocity at that time times a tiny change in time, dt, 

130
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:57,912
which would give the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that little 

131
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,180
time.

132
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,210
I'll talk through the details of examples like this later in the series, 

133
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,431
but at a high level many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalent 

134
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:12,140
to finding the area under some graph, in much the same way that our circle problem did.

135
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,201
This happens whenever the quantities you're adding up, 

136
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,093
the one whose sum approximates the original problem, 

137
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:23,240
can be thought of as the areas of many thin rectangles sitting side by side.

138
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,842
If finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner and 

139
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:35,168
thinner rings, then the original problem is equivalent to finding the area under some 

140
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:35,540
graph.

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,480
Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series, 

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,180
so don't worry if it's not 100% clear right now.

143
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,207
The point now is that you, as the mathematician having just 

144
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:50,635
solved a problem by reframing it as the area under a graph, 

145
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:54,520
might start thinking about how to find the areas under other graphs.

146
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,372
We were lucky in the circle problem that the relevant area turned out to be a triangle, 

147
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:03,760
but imagine instead something like a parabola, the graph of x2.

148
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,077
What's the area underneath that curve, say between 

149
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:10,680
the values of x equals 0 and x equals 3?

150
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,760
Well, it's hard to think about, right?

151
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,020
And let me reframe that question in a slightly different way.

152
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,060
We'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.

153
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,628
Are you able to find a function, a of x, that gives 

154
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:34,180
you the area under this parabola between 0 and x?

155
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,580
A function a of x like this is called an integral of x2.

156
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,655
Calculus holds within it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is, 

157
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,200
but right now it's just a mystery function to us.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,102
We know it gives the area under the graph of x2 between some fixed 

159
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:54,920
left point and some variable right point, but we don't know what it is.

160
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,676
And again, the reason we care about this kind of question is not just 

161
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,430
for the sake of asking hard geometry questions, 

162
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,562
it's because many practical problems that can be approximated by adding 

163
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:10,750
up a large number of small things can be reframed as a question about an 

164
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,300
area under a certain graph.

165
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,427
I'll tell you right now that finding this area, this integral function, 

166
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:22,047
is genuinely hard, and whenever you come across a genuinely hard question in math, 

167
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:25,833
a good policy is to not try too hard to get at the answer directly, 

168
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,340
since usually you just end up banging your head against a wall.

169
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,780
Instead, play around with the idea, with no particular goal in mind.

170
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,136
Spend some time building up familiarity with the interplay between the 

171
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:42,360
function defining the graph, in this case x2, and the function giving the area.

172
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,020
In that playful spirit, if you're lucky, here's something you might notice.

173
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,848
When you slightly increase x by some tiny nudge dx, look at the resulting change in area, 

174
00:11:54,848 --> 00:12:00,420
represented with this sliver I'm going to call da for a tiny difference in area.

175
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,575
That sliver can be pretty well approximated with a rectangle, 

176
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:08,620
one whose height is x2 and whose width is dx.

177
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,284
And the smaller the size of that nudge dx, the 

178
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:15,020
more that sliver actually looks like a rectangle.

179
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,080
This gives us an interesting way to think about how a of x is related to x2.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,647
A change to the output of a, this little da, is about equal to x2, 

181
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:30,254
where x is whatever input you started at, times dx, 

182
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:34,000
the little nudge to the input that caused a to change.

183
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,389
Or rearranged, da divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change in a to the tiny 

184
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,780
change in x that caused it, is approximately whatever x2 is at that point.

185
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,804
And that's an approximation that should get better 

186
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:50,960
and better for smaller and smaller choices of dx.

187
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,640
In other words, we don't know what a of x is, that remains a mystery.

188
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,500
But we do know a property that this mystery function must have.

189
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,052
When you look at two nearby points, for example 3 and 3.001, 

190
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:10,265
consider the change to the output of a between those two points, 

191
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:16,120
the difference between the mystery function evaluated at 3.001 and 3.001.

192
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,283
That change, divided by the difference in the input values, which in this case is 0.001, 

193
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:28,100
should be about equal to the value of x2 for the starting input, in this case 3.001.

194
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,479
And this relationship between tiny changes to the mystery function 

195
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:38,440
and the values of x2 itself is true at all inputs, not just 3.

196
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,021
That doesn't immediately tell us how to find a of x, 

197
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,820
but it provides a very strong clue that we can work with.

198
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,740
And there's nothing special about the graph x2 here.

199
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,787
Any function defined as the area under some graph has this property, 

200
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:58,947
that da divided by a slight nudge to the output of a divided by a slight nudge 

201
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:04,500
to the input that caused it, is about equal to the height of the graph at that point.

202
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Again, that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller choices of dx.

203
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,040
And here, we're stumbling into another big idea from calculus, derivatives.

204
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,170
This ratio da divided by dx is called the derivative of a, or more technically, 

205
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,240
the derivative of whatever this ratio approaches as dx gets smaller and smaller.

206
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,089
I'll dive much more deeply into the idea of a derivative in the next video, 

207
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,565
but loosely speaking it's a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes in 

208
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,080
its input.

209
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,221
You'll see as the series goes on that there are many ways you can visualize a derivative, 

210
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:45,217
depending on what function you're looking at and how you think 

211
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,740
about tiny nudges to its output.

212
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,210
We care about derivatives because they help us solve problems, 

213
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:57,140
and in our little exploration here, we already have a glimpse of one way they're used.

214
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,491
They are the key to solving integral questions, 

215
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:03,420
problems that require finding the area under a curve.

216
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,725
Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives, 

217
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:12,635
you'll be able to look at a situation like this one where you don't know what a function 

218
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,615
is, but you do know that its derivative should be x2, 

219
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,760
and from that reverse engineer what the function must be.

220
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,883
This back and forth between integrals and derivatives, 

221
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:28,052
where the derivative of a function for the area under a graph gives you 

222
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:32,162
back the function defining the graph itself, is called the fundamental 

223
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,320
theorem of calculus.

224
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,820
It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives, 

225
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,360
and shows how each one is an inverse of the other.

226
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,355
All of this is only a high-level view, just a peek 

227
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:49,860
at some of the core ideas that emerge in calculus.

228
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,420
And what follows in this series are the details, for derivatives and integrals and more.

229
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,156
At all points, I want you to feel that you could have invented calculus yourself, 

230
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:03,485
that if you drew the right pictures and played with each idea in just the right way, 

231
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:07,305
these formulas and rules and constructs that are presented could have just 

232
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:10,260
as easily popped out naturally from your own explorations.

233
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,108
And before you go, it would feel wrong not to give the people who supported 

234
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,414
this series on Patreon a well-deserved thanks, 

235
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:22,339
both for their financial backing as well as for the suggestions they gave while 

236
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:23,860
the series was being developed.

237
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,936
You see, supporters got early access to the videos as I made them, 

238
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:31,560
and they'll continue to get early access for future essence-of type series.

239
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,240
And as a thanks to the community, I keep ads off of new videos for their first month.

240
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,510
I'm still astounded that I can spend time working on videos like these, 

241
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,420
and in a very direct way, you are the one to thank for that.
