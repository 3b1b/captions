00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,980
Hey everyone, Grant here.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,740
This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus, and I'll be publishing

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,340
the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,300
The goal here, as the name suggests, is to really get the heart of the subject out in

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,980
one binge-watchable set.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,420
But with a topic that's as broad as calculus, there's a lot of things that can mean, so

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,340
here's what I have in mind specifically.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,620
Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas which are often presented as things to be memorized.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,620
Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule, implicit differentiation,

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,860
the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite, Taylor series, just a lot of things

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,100
like that.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,860
And my goal is for you to come away feeling like you could have invented calculus yourself.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,980
That is, cover all those core ideas, but in a way that makes clear where they actually

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,220
come from, and what they really mean, using an all-around visual approach.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,540
Inventing math is no joke, and there is a difference between being told why something's

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,760
true, and actually generating it from scratch.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,020
But at all points, I want you to think to yourself, if you were an early mathematician,

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,620
pondering these ideas and drawing out the right diagrams, does it feel reasonable that

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,200
you could have stumbled across these truths yourself?

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,760
In this initial video, I want to show how you might stumble into the core ideas of calculus

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,320
by thinking very deeply about one specific bit of geometry, the area of a circle.

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,680
Maybe you know that this is pi times its radius squared, but why?

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,080
Is there a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,640
Well, contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring the interesting

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,920
thoughts that come about can actually lead you to a glimpse of three big ideas in calculus,

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,320
integrals, derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,360
But the story starts more simply, just you and a circle, let's say with radius 3.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,540
You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot of paper trying

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,200
different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area, many of which might lead

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,320
to their own interesting observations, maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,120
into many concentric rings.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,640
This should seem promising, because it respects the symmetry of the circle, and math has a

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Let's take one of those rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one, and if we have

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,960
a nice way to add them all up, it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
area.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Maybe you start by imagining straightening out this ring.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,440
And you could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what its area should

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,160
be, but for simplicity, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,800
The width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring, which is 2 pi times

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
r, right?

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,880
I mean, that's essentially the definition of pi.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
And its thickness?

45
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,800
Well, that depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place, which was

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,540
kind of arbitrary.

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,300
In the spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation, let's call that

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,580
thickness dr for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring to the next.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,900
Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.

50
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,020
So approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle, its area is 2 pi times r,

51
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,660
the radius, times dr, the little thickness.

52
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,100
And even though that's not perfect, for smaller and smaller choices of dr, this is

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,700
actually going to be a better and better approximation for that area, since the top and bottom sides

54
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,540
of this shape are going to get closer and closer to being exactly the same length.

55
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,940
So let's just move forward with this approximation, keeping in the back of our minds that it's

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,900
slightly wrong, but it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices

57
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
of dr.

58
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,740
That is, if we slice up the circle into thinner and thinner rings.

59
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,300
So just to sum up where we are, you've broken up the area of the circle into all of these

60
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,980
rings, and you're approximating the area of each one of those as 2 pi times its radius

61
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,980
times dr, where the specific value for that inner radius ranges from 0 for the smallest

62
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,460
ring, up to just under 3 for the biggest ring, spaced out by whatever thickness you choose

63
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,260
for dr, something like 0.1.

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,420
And notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to the thickness dr of each

65
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,300
ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,900
In fact, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating each ring's area is to fit

67
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,740
them all upright side by side along this axis.

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,580
Each one has a thickness dr, which is why they fit so snugly right there together, and

69
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,900
the height of any one of these rectangles sitting above some specific value of r, like

70
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,900
0.6, is exactly 2 pi times that value.

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,660
That's the circumference of the corresponding ring this rectangle approximates.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,500
Pictured like this, 2 pi r can get tall for the screen.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,460
I mean, 2 times pi times 3 is around 19, so let's just throw up a y-axis that's scaled

74
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,180
a little differently so we can fit all of these rectangles on the screen.

75
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,020
A nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2 pi r, which is a straight

76
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,560
line that has a slope 2 pi.

77
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
Each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,960
Again, we're being approximate here.

79
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,800
Each of these rectangles only approximates the area of the corresponding ring from the

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
circle.

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,280
But remember, that approximation, 2 pi r times dr, gets less and less wrong as the size of

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
dr gets smaller and smaller.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
This has a very beautiful meaning when we're looking at the sum of the areas of all those

84
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
rectangles.

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,560
If you're looking at smaller and smaller choices of dr, you might at first think that

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
that turns the problem into a monstrously large sum.

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,960
I mean, there's many, many rectangles to consider, and the decimal precision of each

88
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
one of their areas is going to be an absolute nightmare.

89
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,120
But notice, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.

90
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,280
And that portion under the graph is just a triangle, a triangle with a base of 3 and

91
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,340
a height that's 2 pi times 3.

92
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:31,540
So its area, 1 half base times height, works out to be exactly pi times 3 squared.

93
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,720
Or if the radius of our original circle was some other value, capital R, that area comes

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,460
out to be pi times r squared.

95
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,340
And that's the formula for the area of a circle.

96
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,260
It doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math, that right there

97
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,720
is a beautiful argument.

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,440
But if you want to think like a mathematician here, you don't just care about finding

99
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,660
the answer, you care about developing general problem solving tools and techniques.

100
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,540
So take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happened and why it worked, because the

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,440
way we transitioned from something approximate to something precise is actually pretty subtle

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,360
and cuts deep to what calculus is all about.

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,700
You had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers, each of

104
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,420
which looked like 2 pi r times dr for values of r ranging between 0 and 3.

105
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,660
Remember, the small number dr here represents our choice for the thickness of each ring,

106
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,620
for example 0.1.

107
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,320
And there are two important things to note here.

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,180
First of all, not only is dr a factor in the quantities we're adding up, 2 pi r times

109
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,140
dr, it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.

110
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,420
Secondly, the smaller our choice for dr, the better the approximation.

111
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,780
Adding all of those numbers could be seen in a different, pretty clever way as adding

112
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,140
the areas of many thin rectangles sitting underneath a graph, the graph of the function

113
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,980
2 pi r in this case.

114
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,680
Then, and this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for dr, corresponding

115
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,620
to better and better approximations of the original problem, the sum, thought of as the

116
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,060
aggregate area of those rectangles, approaches the area under the graph.

117
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,440
And because of that, you can conclude that the answer to the original question, in full

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,260
unapproximated precision, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.

119
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,480
A lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down and approximated as the

120
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,040
sum of many small quantities, things like figuring out how far a car has traveled based

121
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,740
on its velocity at each point in time.

122
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,420
In a case like that, you might range through many different points in time, and at each

123
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,660
one multiply the velocity at that time times a tiny change in time, dt, which would give

124
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,540
the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that little time.

125
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,200
I'll talk through the details of examples like this later in the series, but at a high

126
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,620
level many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalent to finding the area under

127
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,280
some graph, in much the same way our circle problem did.

128
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,520
This happens whenever the quantities you're adding up, the one whose sum approximates

129
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,400
the original problem, can be thought of as the areas of many thin rectangles sitting

130
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,000
side by side like this.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,120
If finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner and thinner

132
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,120
rings, then the original problem is equivalent to finding the area under some graph.

133
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,980
Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series, so don't worry

134
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,900
if it's not 100% clear right now.

135
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,820
The point now is that you, as the mathematician having just solved a problem by reframing

136
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,800
it as the area under a graph, might start thinking about how to find the areas under

137
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
other graphs.

138
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,980
I mean, we were lucky in the circle problem that the relevant area turned out to be a

139
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:05,020
triangle, but imagine instead something like a parabola, the graph of x2.

140
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,440
What's the area underneath that curve, say between the values of x equals 0 and x equals

141
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
3?

142
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Well, it's hard to think about, right?

143
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,280
And let me reframe that question in a slightly different way.

144
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:26,880
We'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,960
Are you able to find a function, a of x, that gives you the area under this parabola between

146
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
0 and x?

147
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,460
A function a of x like this is called an integral of x2.

148
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,820
Calculus holds within it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is, but right

149
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,660
now it's just a mystery function to us.

150
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,100
We know it gives the area under the graph of x2 between some fixed left point and some

151
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,700
variable right point, but we don't know what it is.

152
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,280
And again, the reason we care about this kind of question is not just for the sake of asking

153
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,620
hard geometry questions, it's because many practical problems that can be approximated

154
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,100
by adding up a large number of small things can be reframed as a question about an area

155
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,740
under a certain graph.

156
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,280
And I'll tell you right now that finding this area, this integral function, is genuinely

157
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,940
hard, and whenever you come across a genuinely hard question in math, a good policy is to

158
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,460
not try too hard to get at the answer directly, since usually you just end up banging your

159
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,100
head against a wall.

160
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,280
Instead, play around with the idea, with no particular goal in mind.

161
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,440
Spend some time building up familiarity with the interplay between the function defining

162
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,360
the graph, in this case x2, and the function giving the area.

163
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,960
In that playful spirit, if you're lucky, here's something you might notice.

164
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,520
When you slightly increase x by some tiny nudge dx, look at the resulting change in

165
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,980
area, represented with this sliver that I'm going to call dA, for a tiny difference in

166
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,660
area.

167
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,260
That sliver can be pretty well approximated with a rectangle, one whose height is x2,

168
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,780
and whose width is dx.

169
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,500
And the smaller the size of that nudge dx, the more that sliver actually looks like a

170
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,840
rectangle.

171
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,460
Now this gives us an interesting way to think about how A of x is related to x2.

172
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,280
A change to the output of A, this little dA, is about equal to x2, where x is whatever

173
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,100
input you started at, times dx, the little nudge to the input that caused A to change.

174
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,360
Or rearranged, dA divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change in A to the tiny change in

175
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,660
x that caused it, is approximately whatever x2 is at that point.

176
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,000
And that's an approximation that should get better and better for smaller and smaller

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,180
choices of dx.

178
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,180
In other words, we don't know what A of x is, that remains a mystery, but we do know

179
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,420
a property that this mystery function must have.

180
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:07,420
When you look at two nearby points, for example 3 and 3.001, consider the change to the output

181
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,700
of A between those two points, the difference between the mystery function evaluated at

182
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,580
3.001 and 3.001.

183
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,720
That change, divided by the difference in the input values, which in this case is 0.001,

184
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,720
should be about equal to the value of x2 for the starting input, in this case 3.000.

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,920
And this relationship between tiny changes to the mystery function and the values of

186
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,540
x2 itself is true at all inputs, not just 3.000.

187
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,560
That doesn't immediately tell us how to find A of x, but it provides a very strong

188
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,420
clue we can work with.

189
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,440
And there's nothing special about the graph x2 here.

190
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,000
Any function defined as the area under some graph has this property, that da divided by

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,600
dx, a slight nudge to the output of A divided by a slight nudge to the input that caused

192
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,280
it, is about equal to the height of the graph at that point.

193
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,720
Again, that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller choices of dx.

194
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,180
And here, we're stumbling into another big idea from calculus, derivatives.

195
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,100
This ratio da divided by dx is called the derivative of A, or more technically, the

196
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,460
derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx gets smaller and smaller.

197
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,500
I'll dive much more deeply into the idea of a derivative in the next video, but loosely

198
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,420
speaking it's a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes in its input.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,960
You'll see as the series goes on that there are many ways you can visualize a derivative,

200
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,100
depending on what function you're looking at and how you think about tiny nudges to

201
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,240
its output.

202
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,300
And we care about derivatives because they help us solve problems, and in our little

203
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,880
exploration here, we already have a glimpse of one way they're used.

204
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,820
They are the key to solving integral questions, problems that require finding the area under

205
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,420
a curve.

206
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,400
Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives, you'll be able to look at a

207
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,880
situation like this one, where you don't know what a function is, but you do know its

208
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,760
derivative should be x2, and from that reverse engineer what the function must be.

209
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,520
And this back and forth between integrals and derivatives, where the derivative of a

210
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,960
function for the area under a graph gives you back the function defining the graph itself,

211
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,280
is called the fundamental theorem of calculus.

212
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,660
It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives, and it shows how, in some

213
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,140
sense, each one is an inverse of the other.

214
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,220
All of this is only a high-level view, just a peek at some of the core ideas that emerge

215
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,580
in calculus.

216
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,140
And what follows in this series are the details, for derivatives and integrals and more.

217
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,900
At all points, I want you to feel that you could have invented calculus yourself, that

218
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,040
if you drew the right pictures and played with each idea in just the right way, these

219
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,140
formulas and rules and constructs that are presented could have just as easily popped

220
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,820
out naturally from your own explorations.

221
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,180
And before you go, it would feel wrong not to give the people who supported this series

222
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,860
on Patreon a well-deserved thanks, both for their financial backing as well as for the

223
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,060
suggestions they gave while the series was being developed.

224
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,700
You see, supporters got early access to the videos as I made them, and they'll continue

225
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,380
to get early access for future essence-of type series.

226
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,200
And as a thanks to the community, I keep ads off of new videos for their first month.

227
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm still astounded that I can spend time working on videos like these, and in a very

228
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,600
direct way, you are the one to thank for that.

229
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,460
you
