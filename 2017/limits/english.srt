00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,160
The last several videos have been about the idea of a derivative, and before moving on

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,680
to integrals I want to take some time to talk about limits.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,320
To be honest, the idea of a limit is not really anything new.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,220
If you know what the word approach means you pretty much already know what a limit is.

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,660
You could say it's a matter of assigning fancy notation to the intuitive idea of one

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,620
value that gets closer to another.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,300
But there are a few reasons to devote a full video to this topic.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,020
For one thing, it's worth showing how the way I've been describing derivatives so

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,880
far lines up with the formal definition of a derivative as it's typically presented

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,380
in most courses and textbooks.

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,060
I want to give you a little confidence that thinking in terms of dx and df as concrete

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,860
non-zero nudges is not just some trick for building intuition, it's actually backed

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,140
up by the formal definition of a derivative in all its rigor.

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,640
I also want to shed light on what exactly mathematicians mean when they say approach

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,600
in terms of the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,460
Then we'll finish off with a clever trick for computing limits called L'Hopital's

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,460
rule.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,540
So, first things first, let's take a look at the formal definition of the derivative.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,820
As a reminder, when you have some function f of x, to think about its derivative at a

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,580
particular input, maybe x equals 2, you start by imagining nudging that input some little

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,960
dx away, and looking at the resulting change to the output, df.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,040
The ratio df divided by dx, which can be nicely thought of as the rise over run slope between

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,340
the starting point on the graph and the nudged point, is almost what the derivative is.

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,140
The actual derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,720
Just to spell out what's meant there, that nudge to the output df is the difference between

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,460
f at the starting input plus dx, and f at the starting input, the change to the output

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,680
caused by dx.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,540
To express that you want to find what this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0, you write

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,300
LIM for limit, with dx arrow 0 below it.

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,060
You'll almost never see terms with a lowercase d like dx inside a limit expression like this.

31
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,760
Instead, the standard is to use a different variable, something like delta x, or commonly

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,820
h for whatever reason.

33
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,220
The way I like to think of it is that terms with this lowercase d in the typical derivative

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,660
expression have built into them this idea of a limit, the idea that dx is supposed to

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,020
eventually go to 0.

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,900
In a sense, this left-hand side here, df over dx, the ratio we've been thinking about

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,620
for the past few videos, is just shorthand for what the right-hand side here spells out

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,140
in more detail, writing out exactly what we mean by df, and writing out this limit process

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,800
explicitly.

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,680
This right-hand side here is the formal definition of a derivative, as you would commonly see

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,000
it in any calculus textbook.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,860
And if you'll pardon me for a small rant here, I want to emphasize that nothing about

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,280
this right-hand side references the paradoxical idea of an infinitely small change.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,680
The point of limits is to avoid that.

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,980
This value h is the exact same thing as the dx I've been referencing throughout the series.

46
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,320
It's a nudge to the input of f with some non-zero, finitely small size, like 0.001.

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,460
It's just that we're analyzing what happens for arbitrarily small choices of h.

48
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,800
In fact, the only reason people introduce a new variable name into this formal definition,

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,620
rather than just using dx, is to be super extra clear that these changes to the input

50
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,320
are just ordinary numbers that have nothing to do with infinitesimals.

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,460
There are others who like to interpret this dx as an infinitely small change, or to just

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,280
say that dx and df are nothing more than symbols that we shouldn't take too seriously.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,940
But by now in the series, you know I'm not really a fan of either of those views.

54
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,180
I think you can and should interpret dx as a concrete, finitely small nudge, just so

55
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,460
long as you remember to ask what happens when that thing approaches 0.

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,240
For one thing, and I hope the past few videos have helped convince you of this, that helps

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,780
to build stronger intuition for where the rules of calculus actually come from.

58
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,680
But it's not just some trick for building intuitions.

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,620
Everything I've been saying about derivatives, with this concrete, finitely small nudge philosophy,

60
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,400
is just a translation of this formal definition we're staring at right now.

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,880
Long story short, the big fuss about limits is that they let us avoid talking about infinitely

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,440
small changes, by instead asking what happens as the size of some small change to our variable

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,700
approaches 0.

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,880
This brings us to goal number 2, understanding exactly what it means for one value to approach

65
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,420
another.

66
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:08,520
For example, consider the function 2 plus h cubed minus 2 cubed all divided by h.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,180
This happens to be the expression that pops out when you unravel the definition of a derivative

68
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,900
of x cubed evaluated at x equals 2, but let's just think of it as any old function with

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,720
an input h.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,120
Its graph is this nice continuous looking parabola, which would make sense because it's

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,200
a cubic term divided by a linear term.

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,000
But actually, if you think about what's going on at h equals 0, plugging that in you

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,440
would get 0 divided by 0, which is not defined.

74
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,300
So really, this graph has a hole at that point, and you have to exaggerate to draw that hole,

75
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,640
often with an empty circle like this.

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,860
But keep in mind, the function is perfectly well defined for inputs as close to 0 as you

77
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
want.

78
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,380
Wouldn't you agree that as h approaches 0, the corresponding output, the height of

79
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,260
this graph, approaches 12?

80
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,980
It doesn't matter which side you come at it from.

81
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,400
That limit of this ratio as h approaches 0 is equal to 12.

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,320
But imagine you're a mathematician inventing calculus, and someone asks you, well, what

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,460
exactly do you mean by approach?

84
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,420
That would be kind of an annoying question.

85
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,420
We all know what it means for one value to get closer to another.

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,700
But let's start thinking about ways you might be able to answer that person, completely

87
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,980
unambiguously.

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,900
For a given range of inputs within some distance of 0, excluding the forbidden point 0 itself,

89
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,540
look at all of the corresponding outputs, all possible heights of the graph above that

90
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,100
range.

91
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,540
As the range of input values closes in more and more tightly around 0, that range of output

92
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,020
values closes in more and more closely around 12.

93
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:59,140
Importantly, the size of that range of output values can be made as small as you want.

94
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,740
As a counter example, consider a function that looks like this, which is also not defined

95
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,180
at 0, but kind of jumps up at that point.

96
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,380
When you approach h equals 0 from the right, the function approaches the value 2, but as

97
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,660
you come at it from the left, it approaches 1.

98
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Since there's not a single clear, unambiguous value that this function approaches as h approaches

99
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,220
0, the limit is simply not defined at that point.

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,060
One way to think of this is that when you look at any range of inputs around 0, and

101
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,860
consider the corresponding range of outputs, as you shrink that input range, the corresponding

102
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,540
outputs don't narrow in on any specific value.

103
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,900
Instead, those outputs straddle a range that never shrinks smaller than 1, even as you

104
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,580
make that input range as tiny as you could imagine.

105
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,300
This perspective of shrinking an input range around the limiting point, and seeing whether

106
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,760
or not you're restricted in how much that shrinks the output range, leads to something

107
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,980
called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

108
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,580
You could argue that this is needlessly heavy duty for an introduction to calculus.

109
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,060
If you know what the word approach means, you already know what a limit means, there's

110
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,480
nothing new on the conceptual level here.

111
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,300
But this is an interesting glimpse into the field of real analysis, and gives you a taste

112
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,860
for how mathematicians make the intuitive ideas of calculus more airtight and rigorous.

113
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,900
You've already seen the main idea here.

114
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,500
When a limit exists, you can make the output range as small as you want, but when the limit

115
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,340
doesn't exist, that output range cannot get smaller than some particular value, no

116
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,260
matter how much you shrink the input range around the limiting input.

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,340
Let's freeze that same idea a little more precisely, maybe in the context of this example

118
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,940
where the limiting value was 12.

119
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,080
Think about any distance away from 12, where for some reason it's common to use the Greek

120
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,780
letter epsilon to denote that distance, and the intent here is that this distance epsilon

121
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,340
is as small as you want.

122
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,260
What it means for the limit to exist is that you will always be able to find a range of

123
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,800
inputs around our limiting point, some distance delta around 0, so that any input within delta

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,520
of 0 corresponds to an output within a distance epsilon of 12.

125
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,800
The key point here is that that's true for any epsilon, no matter how small, you'll

126
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
always be able to find the corresponding delta.

127
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,620
In contrast, when a limit does not exist, as in this example here, you can find a sufficiently

128
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,240
small epsilon, like 0.4, so that no matter how small you make your range around 0, no

129
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,780
matter how tiny delta is, the corresponding range of outputs is just always too big.

130
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,060
There is no limiting output where everything is within a distance epsilon of that output.

131
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,960
So far, this is all pretty theory-heavy, don't you think?

132
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,320
Limits being used to formally define the derivative, and then epsilons and deltas being used to

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,860
rigorously define the limit itself.

134
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,100
So let's finish things off here with a trick for actually computing limits.

135
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,340
For instance, let's say for some reason you were studying the function sin of pi times

136
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,540
x divided by x squared minus 1.

137
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,280
Maybe this was modeling some kind of dampened oscillation.

138
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,300
When you plot a bunch of points to graph this, it looks pretty continuous.

139
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:30,000
But there's a problematic value at x equals 1.

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,160
When you plug that in, sin of pi is 0, and the denominator also comes out to 0, so the

141
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,680
function is actually not defined at that input, and the graph should have a hole there.

142
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,180
This also happens at x equals negative 1, but let's just focus our attention on a

143
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,040
single one of these holes for now.

144
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,720
The graph certainly does seem to approach a distinct value at that point, wouldn't

145
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
you say?

146
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,720
So you might ask, how exactly do you find what output this approaches as x approaches

147
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,920
1, since you can't just plug in 1?

148
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,960
One way to approximate it would be to plug in a number that's just really close to

149
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,200
1, like 1.00001.

150
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,260
Doing that, you'd find that this should be a number around negative 1.57.

151
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,180
But is there a way to know precisely what it is?

152
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,620
Some systematic process to take an expression like this one, that looks like 0 divided by

153
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,660
0 at some input, and ask what is its limit as x approaches that input?

154
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,880
After limits, so helpfully let us write the definition for derivatives, derivatives can

155
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,200
actually come back here and return the favor to help us evaluate limits.

156
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,500
Let me show you what I mean.

157
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,620
Here's what the graph of sin of pi times x looks like, and here's what the graph

158
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,020
of x squared minus 1 looks like.

159
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,740
That's a lot to have up on the screen, but just focus on what's happening around x

160
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,220
equals 1.

161
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,740
The point here is that sin of pi times x and x squared minus 1 are both 0 at that point,

162
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,500
they both cross the x-axis.

163
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,960
In the same spirit as plugging in a specific value near 1, like 1.00001, let's zoom in

164
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,760
on that point and consider what happens to a tiny nudge dx away from it.

165
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,480
The value sin of pi times x is bumped down, and the value of that nudge, which was caused

166
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,020
by the nudge dx to the input, is what we might call d sin of pi x.

167
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,800
And from our knowledge of derivatives, using the chain rule, that should be around cosine

168
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,920
of pi times x times pi times dx.

169
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:51,800
Since the starting value was x equals 1, we plug in x equals 1 to that expression.

170
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,480
In other words, the amount that this sin of pi times x graph changes is roughly proportional

171
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,520
to dx, with a proportionality constant equal to cosine of pi times pi.

172
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,200
And cosine of pi, if we think back to our trig knowledge, is exactly negative 1, so

173
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,840
we can write this whole thing as negative pi times dx.

174
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,760
Similarly, the value of the x squared minus 1 graph changes by some dx squared minus 1.

175
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,040
And taking the derivative, the size of that nudge should be 2x times dx.

176
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,440
Again, we were starting at x equals 1, so we plug in x equals 1 to that expression,

177
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,960
meaning the size of that output nudge is about 2 times 1 times dx.

178
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,280
What this means is that for values of x which are just a tiny nudge dx away from 1, the

179
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,120
ratio sin of pi x divided by x squared minus 1 is approximately negative pi times dx divided

180
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,920
by 2 times dx.

181
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,800
The dx's cancel out, so what's left is negative pi over 2.

182
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,880
And importantly, those approximations get more and more accurate for smaller and smaller

183
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,600
choices of dx, right?

184
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,920
This ratio, negative pi over 2, actually tells us the precise limiting value as x approaches

185
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
1.

186
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,280
Remember, what that means is that the limiting height on our original graph is, evidently,

187
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,600
exactly negative pi over 2.

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,320
What happened there is a little subtle, so I want to go through it again, but this time

189
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,400
a little more generally.

190
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,480
Instead of these two specific functions, which are both equal to 0 at x equals 1, think of

191
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,320
any two functions, f of x and g of x, which are both 0 at some common value, x equals

192
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,480
a.

193
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,320
The only constraint is that these have to be functions where you're able to take a

194
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,680
derivative of them at x equals a, which means they each basically look like a line when

195
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,120
you zoom in close enough to that value.

196
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,280
Even though you can't compute f divided by g at this treble point, since both of them

197
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:59,200
equal 0, you can ask about this ratio for values of x really close to a, the limit as

198
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,240
x approaches a.

199
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,880
And it's helpful to think of those nearby inputs as just a tiny nudge, dx, away from

200
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
a.

201
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:14,120
The value of f at that nudged point is approximately its derivative, df over dx, evaluated at a

202
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
times dx.

203
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,920
Likewise, the value of g at that nudged point is approximately the derivative of g, evaluated

204
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,160
at a, times dx.

205
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,440
So near that treble point, the ratio between the outputs of f and g is actually about the

206
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,560
same as the derivative of f at a times dx, divided by the derivative of g at a times

207
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,040
dx.

208
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,480
Those dx's cancel out, so the ratio of f and g near a is about the same as the ratio

209
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,120
between their derivatives.

210
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,800
Because each of those approximations gets more and more accurate for smaller and smaller

211
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,800
nudges, this ratio of derivatives gives the precise value for the limit.

212
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,100
This is a really handy trick for computing a lot of limits.

213
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,340
Whenever you come across some expression that seems to equal 0 divided by 0 when you plug

214
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,700
in some particular input, just try taking the derivative of the top and bottom expressions

215
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,100
and plugging in that same treble input.

216
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,020
This clever trick is called L'Hopital's Rule.

217
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,360
Interestingly, it was actually discovered by Johann Bernoulli, but L'Hopital was this

218
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,380
wealthy dude who essentially paid Bernoulli for the rights to some of his mathematical

219
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,900
discoveries.

220
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,940
Academia is weird back then, but in a very literal way, it pays to understand these tiny

221
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,180
nudges.

222
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,820
Right now, you might be remembering that the definition of a derivative for a given function

223
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,340
comes down to computing the limit of a certain fraction that looks like 0 divided by 0, so

224
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,620
you might think that L'Hopital's Rule could give us a handy way to discover new

225
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,000
derivative formulas.

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,100
But that would actually be cheating, since presumably you don't know what the derivative

227
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,260
of the numerator is.

228
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,980
When it comes to discovering derivative formulas, something we've been doing a fair amount

229
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,620
this series, there is no systematic plug-and-chug method.

230
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,460
But that's a good thing!

231
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,620
Whenever creativity is needed to solve problems like these, it's a good sign that you're

232
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:18,300
doing something real, something that might give you a powerful tool to solve future problems.

233
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,100
And speaking of powerful tools, up next I'm going to be talking about what an integral

234
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,220
theorem is, as well as the fundamental theorem of calculus, another example of where limits

235
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:33,700
can be used to give a clear meaning to a pretty delicate idea that flirts with infinity.

236
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,720
As you know, most support for this channel comes through Patreon, and the primary perk

237
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,240
for patrons is early access to future series like this one, where the next one is going

238
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,500
to be on probability.

239
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,380
But for those of you who want a more tangible way to flag that you're part of the community,

240
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,700
there is also a small 3blue1brown store, links on the screen and in the description.

241
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,460
I'm still debating whether or not to make a preliminary batch of plushie pie creatures,

242
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,180
it depends on how many viewers seem interested in the store more generally, but let me know

243
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,740
in comments what other kinds of things you'd like to see in there.

244
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Thanks for watching!
