00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,312
The last several videos have been about the idea of a derivative, 

2
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:20,940
and before moving on to integrals I want to take some time to talk about limits.

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,820
To be honest, the idea of a limit is not really anything new.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,700
If you know what the word approach means you pretty much already know what a limit is.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,302
You could say it's a matter of assigning fancy notation to 

6
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,620
the intuitive idea of one value that gets closer to another.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,660
But there are a few reasons to devote a full video to this topic.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,684
For one thing, it's worth showing how the way I've been describing 

9
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:46,733
derivatives so far lines up with the formal definition of a 

10
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:50,240
derivative as it's typically presented in most courses and textbooks.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,103
I want to give you a little confidence that thinking in terms of dx and df 

12
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:59,287
as concrete non-zero nudges is not just some trick for building intuition, 

13
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:03,360
it's backed up by the formal definition of a derivative in all its rigor.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,033
I also want to shed light on what exactly mathematicians mean when 

15
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:11,920
they say approach in terms of the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,580
Then we'll finish off with a clever trick for computing limits called L'Hopital's rule.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,700
So, first things first, let's take a look at the formal definition of the derivative.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,431
As a reminder, when you have some function f of x, 

19
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:29,762
to think about its derivative at a particular input, maybe x equals 2, 

20
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:33,605
you start by imagining nudging that input some little dx away, 

21
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:36,900
and looking at the resulting change to the output, df.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,467
The ratio df divided by dx, which can be nicely thought of 

23
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:46,758
as the rise over run slope between the starting point on the graph and the nudged point, 

24
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,720
is almost what the derivative is.

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,960
The actual derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,123
Just to spell out what's meant there, that nudge to the output 

27
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:05,013
df is the difference between f at the starting input plus dx and f at the starting input, 

28
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,500
the change to the output caused by dx.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,341
To express that you want to find what this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0, 

30
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,880
you write lim for limit, with dx arrow 0 below it.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,891
You'll almost never see terms with a lowercase 

32
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,760
d like dx inside a limit expression like this.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,077
Instead, the standard is to use a different variable, 

34
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:31,040
something like delta x, or commonly h for whatever reason.

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,505
The way I like to think of it is that terms with this lowercase 

36
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:40,175
d in the typical derivative expression have built into them this idea of a limit, 

37
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:43,080
the idea that dx is supposed to eventually go to 0.

38
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,609
In a sense, this left hand side here, df over dx, 

39
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:51,207
the ratio we've been thinking about for the past few videos, 

40
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:55,867
is just shorthand for what the right hand side here spells out in more detail, 

41
00:02:55,867 --> 00:03:00,940
writing out exactly what we mean by df, and writing out this limit process explicitly.

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,265
This right hand side here is the formal definition of a derivative, 

43
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,160
as you would commonly see it in any calculus textbook.

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,229
And if you'll pardon me for a small rant here, 

45
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,800
I want to emphasize that nothing about this right hand side references the paradoxical 

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,640
idea of an infinitely small change.

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,960
The point of limits is to avoid that.

48
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,026
This value h is the exact same thing as the dx 

49
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:25,280
I've been referencing throughout the series.

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,280
It's a nudge to the input of f with some non-zero, finitely small size, like 0.001.

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,700
It's just that we're analyzing what happens for arbitrarily small choices of h.

52
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,438
In fact, the only reason people introduce a new variable name into this formal 

53
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:48,296
definition, rather than just using dx, is to be extra clear that these changes 

54
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:53,400
to the input are just ordinary numbers that have nothing to do with infinitesimals.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,060
There are others who like to interpret this dx as an infinitely small change, 

56
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,720
whatever Or to just say that dx and df are nothing more than 

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,420
symbols that we shouldn't take too seriously.

58
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,480
But by now in the series, you know I'm not really a fan of either of those views.

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,232
I think you can and should interpret dx as a concrete, finitely small nudge, 

60
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:18,500
just so long as you remember to ask what happens when that thing approaches 0.

61
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,071
For one thing, and I hope the past few videos have helped convince you of this, 

62
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:27,180
that helps to build stronger intuition for where the rules of calculus actually come from.

63
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,900
But it's not just some trick for building intuitions.

64
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,130
Everything I've been saying about derivatives with this concrete, 

65
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,912
finitely small nudge philosophy is just a translation of this formal definition we're 

66
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,080
staring at right now.

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,677
Long story short, the big fuss about limits is that they let us 

68
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:48,541
avoid talking about infinitely small changes by instead asking what 

69
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,520
happens as the size of some small change to our variable approaches 0.

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,130
And this brings us to goal number 2, understanding 

71
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,260
exactly what it means for one value to approach another.

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,140
For example, consider the function 2 plus h cubed minus 2 cubed all divided by h.

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,273
This happens to be the expression that pops out when you unravel 

74
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:16,183
the definition of a derivative of x cubed evaluated at x equals 2, 

75
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,860
but let's just think of it as any old function with an input h.

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,304
Its graph is this nice continuous looking parabola, 

77
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:27,380
which would make sense because it's a cubic term divided by a linear term.

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,204
But actually, if you think about what's going on at h equals 0, 

79
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:36,460
plugging that in you would get 0 divided by 0, which is not defined.

80
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,248
So really, this graph has a hole at that point, 

81
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:45,140
and you have to exaggerate to draw that hole, often with an empty circle like this.

82
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,840
But keep in mind, the function is perfectly well 

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,320
defined for inputs as close to 0 as you want.

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,703
Wouldn't you agree that as h approaches 0, the corresponding output, 

85
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,280
the height of this graph, approaches 12?

86
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,580
It doesn't matter which side you come at it from.

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,200
That limit of this ratio as h approaches 0 is equal to 12.

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,743
But imagine you're a mathematician inventing calculus, 

89
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:17,480
and someone skeptically asks you, well, what exactly do you mean by approach?

90
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,218
That would be kind of an annoying question, I mean, come on, 

91
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:24,180
we all know what it means for one value to get closer to another.

92
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,533
But let's start thinking about ways you might be able to answer that person, 

93
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,700
completely unambiguously.

94
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,187
For a given range of inputs within some distance of 0, 

95
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:39,028
excluding the forbidden point 0 itself, look at all of the corresponding outputs, 

96
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,040
all possible heights of the graph above that range.

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,281
As the range of input values closes in more and more tightly around 0, 

98
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:51,640
that range of output values closes in more and more closely around 12.

99
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,280
And importantly, the size of that range of output values can be made as small as you want.

100
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,527
As a counter example, consider a function that looks like this, 

101
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:06,200
which is also not defined at 0, but kind of jumps up at that point.

102
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,600
When you approach h equals 0 from the right, the function approaches the value 2, 

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
but as you come at it from the left, it approaches 1.

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,043
Since there's not a single clear, unambiguous value that this function 

105
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:24,420
approaches as h approaches 0, the limit is not defined at that point.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,066
One way to think of this is that when you look at any range of inputs around 0, 

107
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:35,034
and consider the corresponding range of outputs, as you shrink that input range, 

108
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:38,960
the corresponding outputs don't narrow in on any specific value.

109
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,910
Instead, those outputs straddle a range that never shrinks smaller than 1, 

110
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,380
even as you make that input range as tiny as you could imagine.

111
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,299
This perspective of shrinking an input range around the limiting point, 

112
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:56,867
and seeing whether or not you're restricted in how much that shrinks the output range, 

113
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,280
leads to something called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

114
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,319
Now I should tell you, you could argue that this is 

115
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,500
needlessly heavy duty for an introduction to calculus.

116
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,353
Like I said, if you know what the word approach means, 

117
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:11,940
you already know what a limit means, there's nothing new on the conceptual level here.

118
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,284
But this is an interesting glimpse into the field of real analysis, 

119
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:21,357
and gives you a taste for how mathematicians make the intuitive ideas of calculus more 

120
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:22,640
airtight and rigorous.

121
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,340
You've already seen the main idea here.

122
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,622
When a limit exists, you can make this output range as small as you want, 

123
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:33,960
but when the limit doesn't exist, that output range cannot get smaller than some 

124
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,780
particular value, no matter how much you shrink the input range around the limiting input.

125
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,373
Let's freeze that same idea a little more precisely, 

126
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,880
maybe in the context of this example where the limiting value was 12.

127
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,033
Think about any distance away from 12, where for some reason it's 

128
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:53,140
common to use the Greek letter epsilon to denote that distance.

129
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,040
The intent here is that this distance epsilon is as small as you want.

130
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,701
What it means for the limit to exist is that you will always be able to find a 

131
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:10,136
range of inputs around our limiting point, some distance delta around 0, 

132
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:16,017
so that any input within delta of 0 corresponds to an output within a distance 

133
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:17,060
epsilon of 12.

134
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,155
The key point here is that that's true for any epsilon, 

135
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:24,820
no matter how small, you'll always be able to find the corresponding delta.

136
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,999
In contrast, when a limit does not exist, as in this example here, 

137
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,495
you can find a sufficiently small epsilon, like 0.4, 

138
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:39,234
so that no matter how small you make your range around 0, no matter how tiny delta is, 

139
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:43,060
the corresponding range of outputs is just always too big.

140
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,640
There is no limiting output where everything is within a distance epsilon of that output.

141
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,160
So far, this is all pretty theory-heavy, don't you think?

142
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,388
Limits being used to formally define the derivative, 

143
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:04,120
and epsilons and deltas being used to rigorously define the limit itself.

144
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,260
So let's finish things off here with a trick for actually computing limits.

145
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,363
For instance, let's say for some reason you were studying 

146
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:15,740
the function sin of pi times x divided by x squared minus 1.

147
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,240
Maybe this was modeling some kind of dampened oscillation.

148
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,460
When you plot a bunch of points to graph this, it looks pretty continuous.

149
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,480
But there's a problematic value at x equals 1.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,342
When you plug that in, sin of pi is 0, and the denominator also comes out to 0, 

151
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:39,015
so the function is actually not defined at that input, 

152
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:41,620
and the graph should have a hole there.

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,511
This also happens at x equals negative 1, but let's just 

154
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,940
focus our attention on a single one of these holes for now.

155
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,776
The graph certainly does seem to approach a distinct value at that point, 

156
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:54,640
wouldn't you say?

157
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,005
So you might ask, how exactly do you find what output this approaches as x approaches 1, 

158
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,000
since you can't just plug in 1?

159
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,624
Well, one way to approximate it would be to plug in 

160
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:15,360
a number that's just really close to 1, like 1.00001.

161
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Doing that, you'd find that this should be a number around negative 1.57.

162
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,600
But is there a way to know precisely what it is?

163
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,001
Some systematic process to take an expression like this one, 

164
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:33,500
that looks like 0 divided by and ask, what is its limit as x approaches that input?

165
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,157
After limits, so helpfully let us write the definition for derivatives, 

166
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:44,700
derivatives can actually come back here and return the favor to help us evaluate limits.

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,020
Let me show you what I mean.

168
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,368
Here's what the graph of sin of pi times x looks like, 

169
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:53,900
and here's what the graph of x squared minus 1 looks like.

170
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,780
That's a lot to have up on the screen, but just 

171
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,420
focus on what's happening around x equals 1.

172
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,302
The point here is that sin of pi times x and x squared minus 1 are both 0 at that point, 

173
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:08,160
they both cross the x axis.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,277
In the same spirit as plugging in a specific value near 1, like 1.00001, 

175
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:20,640
let's zoom in on that point and consider what happens just a tiny nudge dx away from it.

176
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,381
The value sin of pi times x is bumped down, and the value of that nudge, 

177
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:32,160
which was caused by the nudge dx to the input, is what we might call d sin of pi x.

178
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,260
And from our knowledge of derivatives, using the chain rule, 

179
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,480
that should be around cosine of pi times x times pi times dx.

180
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Since the starting value was x equals 1, we plug in x equals 1 to that expression.

181
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,707
In other words, the amount that this sin of pi times x graph changes is roughly 

182
00:12:56,707 --> 00:13:02,360
proportional to dx, with a proportionality constant equal to cosine of pi times pi.

183
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,646
And cosine of pi, if we think back to our trig knowledge, 

184
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:11,180
is exactly negative 1, so we can write this whole thing as negative pi times dx.

185
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,445
Similarly, the value of the x squared minus 1 graph changes by some dx squared minus 1, 

186
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:23,540
and taking the derivative, the size of that nudge should be 2x times dx.

187
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,407
Again, we were starting at x equals 1, so we plug in x equals 1 to that expression, 

188
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:33,280
meaning the size of that output nudge is about 2 times 1 times dx.

189
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,278
What this means is that for values of x which are just a tiny nudge dx away from 1, 

190
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,425
the ratio sin of pi x divided by x squared minus 1 is approximately 

191
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,680
negative pi times dx divided by 2 times dx.

192
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,740
The dx's cancel out, so what's left is negative pi over 2.

193
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,591
And importantly, those approximations get more and more 

194
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,360
accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dx, right?

195
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,619
This ratio, negative pi over 2, actually tells 

196
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:09,000
us the precise limiting value as x approaches 1.

197
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,107
Remember, what that means is that the limiting height on 

198
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:16,800
our original graph is evidently exactly negative pi over 2.

199
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,602
What happened there is a little subtle, so I want to go through it again, 

200
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,340
but this time a little more generally.

201
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,388
Instead of these two specific functions, which are both equal to 0 at x equals 1, 

202
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:34,913
think of any two functions, f of x and g of x, which are both 0 at some common value, 

203
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:35,620
x equals a.

204
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,563
The only constraint is that these have to be functions where you're 

205
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:41,929
able to take a derivative of them at x equals a, 

206
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,406
which means they each basically look like a line when you zoom in close 

207
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,420
enough to that value.

208
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,393
Even though you can't compute f divided by g at this trouble point, 

209
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:56,514
since both of them equal 0, you can ask about this ratio for 

210
00:14:56,514 --> 00:15:00,500
values of x really close to a, the limit as x approaches a.

211
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,200
It's helpful to think of those nearby inputs as just a tiny nudge, dx, away from a.

212
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,161
The value of f at that nudged point is approximately its derivative, 

213
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,980
df over dx, evaluated at a times dx.

214
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:22,124
Likewise, the value of g at that nudged point is approximately the derivative of g, 

215
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,880
evaluated at a times dx.

216
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Near that trouble point, the ratio between the outputs of f and g is actually about the 

217
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,060
same as the derivative of f at a times dx, divided by the derivative of g at a times dx.

218
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,119
Those dx's cancel out, so the ratio of f and g near a 

219
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,540
is about the same as the ratio between their derivatives.

220
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,307
Because each of those approximations gets more and more accurate for smaller and 

221
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:54,700
smaller nudges, this ratio of derivatives gives the precise value for the limit.

222
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,500
This is a really handy trick for computing a lot of limits.

223
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,938
Whenever you come across some expression that seems to equal 0 divided by 

224
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:06,901
0 when you plug in some particular input, just try taking the derivative 

225
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,920
of the top and bottom expressions and plugging in that same trouble input.

226
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,300
This clever trick is called L'Hopital's Rule.

227
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,182
Interestingly, it was actually discovered by Johann Bernoulli, 

228
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:22,844
but L'Hopital was this wealthy dude who essentially paid 

229
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,880
Bernoulli for the rights to some of his mathematical discoveries.

230
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,076
Academia is weird back then, but in a very literal way, 

231
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,460
it pays to understand these tiny nudges.

232
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,717
Right now, you might be remembering that the definition of a derivative 

233
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:42,265
for a given function comes down to computing the limit of a certain 

234
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:45,657
fraction that looks like 0 divided by 0, so you might think that 

235
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:49,780
L'Hopital's Rule could give us a handy way to discover new derivative formulas.

236
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,474
But that would actually be cheating, since presumably 

237
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:56,320
you don't know what the derivative of the numerator is.

238
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,594
When it comes to discovering derivative formulas, 

239
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:02,374
something we've been doing a fair amount this series, 

240
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:04,640
there is no systematic plug-and-chug method.

241
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,960
But that's a good thing!

242
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,373
Whenever creativity is needed to solve problems like these, 

243
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,901
it's a good sign that you're doing something real, 

244
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:15,420
something that might give you a powerful tool to solve future problems.

245
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,908
And speaking of powerful tools, up next I'm going to be talking about what an integral 

246
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,687
is, as well as the fundamental theorem of calculus, 

247
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:30,443
another example of where limits can be used to give a clear meaning to a pretty delicate 

248
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:32,100
idea that flirts with infinity.

249
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,819
As you know, most support for this channel comes through Patreon, 

250
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:40,795
and the primary perk for patrons is early access to future series like this one, 

251
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:43,200
where the next one is going to be on probability.

252
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,755
But for those of you who want a more tangible way to flag that 

253
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:51,640
you're part of the community, there is also a small 3blue1brown store.

254
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,960
Links on the screen and in the description.

255
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:05,700
I'm still debating whether or not to make a preliminary batch of plushie pie creatures, 

256
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:15,970
it kinda depends on how many viewers seem interested in the store more generally, 

257
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:26,240
but let me know in comments what other kinds of things you'd like to see in there.
