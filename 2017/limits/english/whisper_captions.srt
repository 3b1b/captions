00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
The last several videos have been about the idea of a derivative, and before moving on

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,940
to integrals I want to take some time to talk about limits.

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,820
To be honest, the idea of a limit is not really anything new.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,700
If you know what the word approach means you pretty much already know what a limit is.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,760
You could say it's a matter of assigning fancy notation to the intuitive idea of one

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,620
value that gets closer to another.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,660
But there are a few reasons to devote a full video to this topic.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,100
For one thing, it's worth showing how the way I've been describing derivatives so

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,840
far lines up with the formal definition of a derivative as it's typically presented

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,240
in most courses and textbooks.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to give you a little confidence that thinking in terms of dx and df as concrete

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,740
non-zero nudges is not just some trick for building intuition, it's backed up by the

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,360
formal definition of a derivative in all its rigor.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,220
I also want to shed light on what exactly mathematicians mean when they say approach

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,920
in terms of the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,400
Then we'll finish off with a clever trick for computing limits called L'Hopital's

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,580
rule.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,700
So, first things first, let's take a look at the formal definition of the derivative.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,000
As a reminder, when you have some function f of x, to think about its derivative at a

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,400
particular input, maybe x equals 2, you start by imagining nudging that input some little

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,900
dx away, and looking at the resulting change to the output, df.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,040
The ratio df divided by dx, which can be nicely thought of as the rise over run slope between

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,720
the starting point on the graph and the nudged point, is almost what the derivative is.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,960
The actual derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,760
Just to spell out what's meant there, that nudge to the output df is the difference between

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,820
f at the starting input plus dx and f at the starting input, the change to the output caused

27
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,500
by dx.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,640
To express that you want to find what this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0, you write

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,880
lim for limit, with dx arrow 0 below it.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,760
You'll almost never see terms with a lowercase d like dx inside a limit expression like this.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,620
Instead, the standard is to use a different variable, something like delta x, or commonly

32
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,040
h for whatever reason.

33
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,220
The way I like to think of it is that terms with this lowercase d in the typical derivative

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,800
expression have built into them this idea of a limit, the idea that dx is supposed to

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,080
eventually go to 0.

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,940
In a sense, this left hand side here, df over dx, the ratio we've been thinking about

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,680
for the past few videos, is just shorthand for what the right hand side here spells out

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,220
in more detail, writing out exactly what we mean by df, and writing out this limit process

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,940
explicitly.

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,780
This right hand side here is the formal definition of a derivative, as you would commonly see

41
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,160
it in any calculus textbook.

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,880
And if you'll pardon me for a small rant here, I want to emphasize that nothing about

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,640
this right hand side references the paradoxical idea of an infinitely small change.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,960
The point of limits is to avoid that.

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,920
This value h is the exact same thing as the dx I've been referencing throughout the

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,280
series.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,280
It's a nudge to the input of f with some non-zero, finitely small size, like 0.001.

48
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,700
It's just that we're analyzing what happens for arbitrarily small choices of h.

49
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,340
In fact, the only reason people introduce a new variable name into this formal definition,

50
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,780
rather than just using dx, is to be extra clear that these changes to the input are

51
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,400
just ordinary numbers that have nothing to do with infinitesimals.

52
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,760
There are others who like to interpret this dx as an infinitely small change, whatever

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,680
Or to just say that dx and df are nothing more than symbols that we shouldn't take

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,420
too seriously.

55
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,480
But by now in the series, you know I'm not really a fan of either of those views.

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,280
I think you can and should interpret dx as a concrete, finitely small nudge, just so

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,500
long as you remember to ask what happens when that thing approaches 0.

58
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,280
For one thing, and I hope the past few videos have helped convince you of this, that helps

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,180
to build stronger intuition for where the rules of calculus actually come from.

60
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,900
But it's not just some trick for building intuitions.

61
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,060
Everything I've been saying about derivatives with this concrete, finitely small nudge philosophy

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,080
is just a translation of this formal definition we're staring at right now.

63
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,860
Long story short, the big fuss about limits is that they let us avoid talking about infinitely

64
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,300
small changes by instead asking what happens as the size of some small change to our variable

65
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,520
approaches 0.

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,800
And this brings us to goal number 2, understanding exactly what it means for one value to approach

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,260
another.

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,140
For example, consider the function 2 plus h cubed minus 2 cubed all divided by h.

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,000
This happens to be the expression that pops out when you unravel the definition of a derivative

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
of x cubed evaluated at x equals 2, but let's just think of it as any old function with

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,860
an input h.

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,200
Its graph is this nice continuous looking parabola, which would make sense because it's

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,380
a cubic term divided by a linear term.

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,060
But actually, if you think about what's going on at h equals 0, plugging that in you

75
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,460
would get 0 divided by 0, which is not defined.

76
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,880
So really, this graph has a hole at that point, and you have to exaggerate to draw that hole,

77
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
often with an empty circle like this.

78
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,960
But keep in mind, the function is perfectly well defined for inputs as close to 0 as you

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,320
want.

80
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,460
Wouldn't you agree that as h approaches 0, the corresponding output, the height of

81
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,280
this graph, approaches 12?

82
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,580
It doesn't matter which side you come at it from.

83
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,200
That limit of this ratio as h approaches 0 is equal to 12.

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,440
But imagine you're a mathematician inventing calculus, and someone skeptically asks you,

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,480
well, what exactly do you mean by approach?

86
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,360
That would be kind of an annoying question, I mean, come on, we all know what it means

87
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,180
for one value to get closer to another.

88
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,760
But let's start thinking about ways you might be able to answer that person, completely

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,700
unambiguously.

90
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,240
For a given range of inputs within some distance of 0, excluding the forbidden point 0 itself,

91
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,600
look at all of the corresponding outputs, all possible heights of the graph above that

92
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,040
range.

93
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,620
As the range of input values closes in more and more tightly around 0, that range of output

94
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,640
values closes in more and more closely around 12.

95
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,980
And importantly, the size of that range of output values can be made as small as you

96
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,280
want.

97
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,740
As a counter example, consider a function that looks like this, which is also not defined

98
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,200
at 0, but kind of jumps up at that point.

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,440
When you approach h equals 0 from the right, the function approaches the value 2, but as

100
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,600
you come at it from the left, it approaches 1.

101
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Since there's not a single clear, unambiguous value that this function approaches as h approaches

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,420
0, the limit is not defined at that point.

103
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,080
One way to think of this is that when you look at any range of inputs around 0, and

104
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,920
consider the corresponding range of outputs, as you shrink that input range, the corresponding

105
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,960
outputs don't narrow in on any specific value.

106
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,960
Instead, those outputs straddle a range that never shrinks smaller than 1, even as you

107
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,380
make that input range as tiny as you could imagine.

108
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,340
This perspective of shrinking an input range around the limiting point, and seeing whether

109
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,780
or not you're restricted in how much that shrinks the output range, leads to something

110
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,280
called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

111
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,900
Now I should tell you, you could argue that this is needlessly heavy duty for an introduction

112
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,500
to calculus.

113
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,720
Like I said, if you know what the word approach means, you already know what a limit means,

114
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,940
there's nothing new on the conceptual level here.

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,300
But this is an interesting glimpse into the field of real analysis, and gives you a taste

116
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,640
for how mathematicians make the intuitive ideas of calculus more airtight and rigorous.

117
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,340
You've already seen the main idea here.

118
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,460
When a limit exists, you can make this output range as small as you want, but when the limit

119
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,400
doesn't exist, that output range cannot get smaller than some particular value, no

120
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,780
matter how much you shrink the input range around the limiting input.

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,340
Let's freeze that same idea a little more precisely, maybe in the context of this example

122
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,880
where the limiting value was 12.

123
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,120
Think about any distance away from 12, where for some reason it's common to use the Greek

124
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,140
letter epsilon to denote that distance.

125
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,040
The intent here is that this distance epsilon is as small as you want.

126
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,360
What it means for the limit to exist is that you will always be able to find a range of

127
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,840
inputs around our limiting point, some distance delta around 0, so that any input within delta

128
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,060
of 0 corresponds to an output within a distance epsilon of 12.

129
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,760
The key point here is that that's true for any epsilon, no matter how small, you'll

130
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,820
always be able to find the corresponding delta.

131
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,580
In contrast, when a limit does not exist, as in this example here, you can find a sufficiently

132
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,320
small epsilon, like 0.4, so that no matter how small you make your range around 0, no

133
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,060
matter how tiny delta is, the corresponding range of outputs is just always too big.

134
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,640
There is no limiting output where everything is within a distance epsilon of that output.

135
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,160
So far, this is all pretty theory-heavy, don't you think?

136
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,840
Limits being used to formally define the derivative, and epsilons and deltas being used to rigorously

137
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
define the limit itself.

138
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,260
So let's finish things off here with a trick for actually computing limits.

139
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,400
For instance, let's say for some reason you were studying the function sin of pi times

140
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,740
x divided by x squared minus 1.

141
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,240
Maybe this was modeling some kind of dampened oscillation.

142
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,460
When you plot a bunch of points to graph this, it looks pretty continuous.

143
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,480
But there's a problematic value at x equals 1.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,240
When you plug that in, sin of pi is 0, and the denominator also comes out to 0, so the

145
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,620
function is actually not defined at that input, and the graph should have a hole there.

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,380
This also happens at x equals negative 1, but let's just focus our attention on a

147
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,940
single one of these holes for now.

148
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,680
The graph certainly does seem to approach a distinct value at that point, wouldn't

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,640
you say?

150
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,420
So you might ask, how exactly do you find what output this approaches as x approaches

151
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,000
1, since you can't just plug in 1?

152
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,620
Well, one way to approximate it would be to plug in a number that's just really close

153
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,360
to 1, like 1.00001.

154
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Doing that, you'd find that this should be a number around negative 1.57.

155
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,600
But is there a way to know precisely what it is?

156
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,600
Some systematic process to take an expression like this one, that looks like 0 divided by

157
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,500
and ask, what is its limit as x approaches that input?

158
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,960
After limits, so helpfully let us write the definition for derivatives, derivatives can

159
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,700
actually come back here and return the favor to help us evaluate limits.

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,020
Let me show you what I mean.

161
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,640
Here's what the graph of sin of pi times x looks like, and here's what the graph

162
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,900
of x squared minus 1 looks like.

163
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,640
That's a lot to have up on the screen, but just focus on what's happening around x

164
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,420
equals 1.

165
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,160
The point here is that sin of pi times x and x squared minus 1 are both 0 at that point,

166
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,160
they both cross the x axis.

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In the same spirit as plugging in a specific value near 1, like 1.00001, let's zoom in

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,640
on that point and consider what happens just a tiny nudge dx away from it.

169
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,440
The value sin of pi times x is bumped down, and the value of that nudge, which was caused

170
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,160
by the nudge dx to the input, is what we might call d sin of pi x.

171
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,860
And from our knowledge of derivatives, using the chain rule, that should be around cosine

172
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,480
of pi times x times pi times dx.

173
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Since the starting value was x equals 1, we plug in x equals 1 to that expression.

174
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,380
In other words, the amount that this sin of pi times x graph changes is roughly proportional

175
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,360
to dx, with a proportionality constant equal to cosine of pi times pi.

176
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,220
And cosine of pi, if we think back to our trig knowledge, is exactly negative 1, so

177
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,180
we can write this whole thing as negative pi times dx.

178
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Similarly, the value of the x squared minus 1 graph changes by some dx squared minus 1,

179
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,540
and taking the derivative, the size of that nudge should be 2x times dx.

180
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
Again, we were starting at x equals 1, so we plug in x equals 1 to that expression,

181
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,280
meaning the size of that output nudge is about 2 times 1 times dx.

182
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,480
What this means is that for values of x which are just a tiny nudge dx away from 1, the

183
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,100
ratio sin of pi x divided by x squared minus 1 is approximately negative pi times dx divided

184
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,680
by 2 times dx.

185
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,740
The dx's cancel out, so what's left is negative pi over 2.

186
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,940
And importantly, those approximations get more and more accurate for smaller and smaller

187
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,360
choices of dx, right?

188
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:08,580
This ratio, negative pi over 2, actually tells us the precise limiting value as x approaches

189
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,000
1.

190
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,420
Remember, what that means is that the limiting height on our original graph is evidently

191
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,800
exactly negative pi over 2.

192
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,280
What happened there is a little subtle, so I want to go through it again, but this time

193
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,340
a little more generally.

194
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,420
Instead of these two specific functions, which are both equal to 0 at x equals 1, think of

195
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,260
any two functions, f of x and g of x, which are both 0 at some common value, x equals

196
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,620
a.

197
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,500
The only constraint is that these have to be functions where you're able to take a

198
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,720
derivative of them at x equals a, which means they each basically look like a line when

199
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,420
you zoom in close enough to that value.

200
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,220
Even though you can't compute f divided by g at this trouble point, since both of

201
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,780
them equal 0, you can ask about this ratio for values of x really close to a, the limit

202
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,500
as x approaches a.

203
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,200
It's helpful to think of those nearby inputs as just a tiny nudge, dx, away from a.

204
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,660
The value of f at that nudged point is approximately its derivative, df over dx, evaluated at a

205
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,980
times dx.

206
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,860
Likewise, the value of g at that nudged point is approximately the derivative of g, evaluated

207
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,880
at a times dx.

208
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,480
Near that trouble point, the ratio between the outputs of f and g is actually about the

209
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,600
same as the derivative of f at a times dx, divided by the derivative of g at a times

210
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,060
dx.

211
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,460
Those dx's cancel out, so the ratio of f and g near a is about the same as the ratio

212
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,540
between their derivatives.

213
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,840
Because each of those approximations gets more and more accurate for smaller and smaller

214
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,700
nudges, this ratio of derivatives gives the precise value for the limit.

215
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,500
This is a really handy trick for computing a lot of limits.

216
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,360
Whenever you come across some expression that seems to equal 0 divided by 0 when you plug

217
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,280
in some particular input, just try taking the derivative of the top and bottom expressions

218
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,920
and plugging in that same trouble input.

219
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,300
This clever trick is called L'Hopital's Rule.

220
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,420
Interestingly, it was actually discovered by Johann Bernoulli, but L'Hopital was this

221
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,260
wealthy dude who essentially paid Bernoulli for the rights to some of his mathematical

222
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,880
discoveries.

223
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,000
Academia is weird back then, but in a very literal way, it pays to understand these tiny

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,460
nudges.

225
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,360
Right now, you might be remembering that the definition of a derivative for a given function

226
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,280
comes down to computing the limit of a certain fraction that looks like 0 divided by 0, so

227
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,780
you might think that L'Hopital's Rule could give us a handy way to discover new

228
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
derivative formulas.

229
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,080
But that would actually be cheating, since presumably you don't know what the derivative

230
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
of the numerator is.

231
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,980
When it comes to discovering derivative formulas, something we've been doing a fair amount

232
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,640
this series, there is no systematic plug-and-chug method.

233
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,960
But that's a good thing!

234
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,580
Whenever creativity is needed to solve problems like these, it's a good sign that you're

235
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,420
doing something real, something that might give you a powerful tool to solve future problems.

236
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,980
And speaking of powerful tools, up next I'm going to be talking about what an integral

237
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,220
is, as well as the fundamental theorem of calculus, another example of where limits

238
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,100
can be used to give a clear meaning to a pretty delicate idea that flirts with infinity.

239
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,740
As you know, most support for this channel comes through Patreon, and the primary perk

240
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,280
for patrons is early access to future series like this one, where the next one is going

241
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,200
to be on probability.

242
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,680
But for those of you who want a more tangible way to flag that you're part of the community,

243
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,640
there is also a small 3blue1brown store.

244
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,960
Links on the screen and in the description.

245
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,900
I'm still debating whether or not to make a preliminary batch of plushie pie creatures,

246
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,760
it kinda depends on how many viewers seem interested in the store more generally, but

247
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,800
let me know in comments what other kinds of things you'd like to see in there.

248
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,240
Thanks for watching!
