1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's talk about space-filling curves.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,640
They are incredibly fun to animate, and they also give a chance to address a certain philosophical

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,220
question.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,760
Math often deals with infinite quantities, sometimes so intimately that the very substance

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,180
of a result only actually makes sense in an infinite world.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,680
So the question is, how can these results ever be useful in a finite context?

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,420
As with all philosophizing, this is best left to discuss until after we look at the concrete

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,640
case and the real math.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,040
So I'll begin by laying down an application of something called a Hilbert curve, followed

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,980
by a description of some of its origins in infinite math.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,740
Let's say you wanted to write some software that would enable people to see with their

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,200
ears.

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,660
It would take in data from a camera, and then somehow translate that into a sound in a meaningful

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,060
way.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,260
The thought here is that brains are plastic enough to build an intuition from sight even

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,080
when the raw data is scrambled into a different format.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,680
I've left a few links in the description to studies to this effect.

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,020
To make initial experiments easier, you might start by treating incoming images with a low

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,480
resolution, maybe 256 by 256 pixels.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,140
And to make my own animation efforts easier, let's represent one of these images with

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,240
a square grid, each cell corresponding with a pixel.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,740
One approach to this sound-to-sight software would be to find a nice way to associate each

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,140
one of those pixels with a unique frequency value.

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,980
Then when that pixel is brighter, the frequency associated with it would be played louder,

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,400
and if the pixel were darker, the frequency would be quiet.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,040
Listening to all of the pixels all at once would then sound like a bunch of frequencies

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,880
overlaid on top of one another, with dominant frequencies corresponding to the brighter

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,640
regions of the image sounding like some cacophonous mess until your brain learns to make sense

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,740
out of the information it contains.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,320
Let's temporarily set aside worries about whether or not this would actually work, and

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,800
instead think about what function, from pixel space down to frequency space, gives this

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,480
software the best chance of working.

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,280
The tricky part is that pixel space is two-dimensional, but frequency space is one-dimensional.

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,100
You could, of course, try doing this with a random mapping.

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,600
After all, we're hoping that people's brains make sense out of pretty wonky data anyway.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,640
However, it might be nice to leverage some of the intuitions that a given human brain

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,300
already has about sound.

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,320
For example, if we think in terms of the reverse mapping from frequency space to pixel space,

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,260
frequencies that are close together should stay close together in the pixel space.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,280
That way, even if an ear has a hard time distinguishing between two nearby frequencies, they will

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,320
at least refer to the same basic point in space.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,560
To ensure this happens, you could first describe a way to weave a line through each one of

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,220
these pixels.

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,140
Then if you fix each pixel to a spot on that line and unravel the whole thread to make

45
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,860
it straight, you could interpret this line as a frequency space, and you have an association

46
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,940
from pixels to frequencies.

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,960
One weaving method would be to just go one row at a time, alternating between left and

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,980
right as it moves up that pixel space.

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,400
This is like a well-played game of Snake, so let's call this a Snake Curve.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,180
When you tell your mathematician friend about this idea, she says, why not use a Hilbert

51
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,460
curve?

52
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,600
When you ask her what that is, she stumbles for a moment.

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,380
So it's not a curve, but an infinite family of curves.

54
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,680
She starts, well no, it's just one thing, but I need to tell you about a certain infinite

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,540
family first.

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,500
She pulls out a piece of paper and starts explaining what she decides to call pseudo-Hilbert

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,740
curves, for lack of a better term.

58
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,940
For an order-one pseudo-Hilbert curve, you divide a square into a 2x2 grid, and connect

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,560
the center of the lower left quadrant to the center of the upper left, over to the upper

60
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,060
right, and then down in the lower right.

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,480
For an order-two pseudo-Hilbert curve, rather than just going straight from one quadrant

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,540
to another, we let our curve do a little work to fill out each quadrant while it does so.

63
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,340
Specifically, subdivide the square further into a 4x4 grid, and we have our curve trace

64
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,160
out a miniature order-one pseudo-Hilbert curve inside each quadrant before it moves on to

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,640
the next.

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,040
If we left those mini-curves oriented as they are, going from the end of the mini-curve

67
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,280
in the lower left to the start of the mini-curve in the upper left requires an awkward jump,

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,000
same deal with going from the upper right down to the lower right, so we flip the curves

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,580
in the lower left and lower right to make that connection shorter.

70
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,780
Going from an order-two to an order-three pseudo-Hilbert curve is similar.

71
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,300
You divide the square into an 8x8 grid, then put an order-two pseudo-Hilbert curve in each

72
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,740
quadrant, flip the lower left and lower right appropriately, and connect them all tip to

73
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,220
tail.

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,780
And the pattern continues like that for higher orders.

75
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,920
For the 256x256 pixel array, your mathematician friend explains, you would use an order-eight

76
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,140
pseudo-Hilbert curve.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,420
And remember, defining a curve which weaves through each pixel is basically the same as

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:42,280
defining a function from pixel space to frequency space, since you're associating each pixel

79
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,060
with a point on the line.

80
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,420
Now this is nice as a piece of art, but why would these pseudo-Hilbert curves be any better

81
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,540
than just the snake curve?

82
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,380
Well here's one very important reason.

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,100
Imagine that you go through with this project, you integrate the software with real cameras

84
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,640
and headphones, and it works!

85
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,360
People around the world are using the device, building intuitions for vision via sound.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,040
What happens when you issue an upgrade that increases the resolution of the camera's

87
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,300
image from 256x256 to 512x512?

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,040
If you were using the snake curve, as you transition to a higher resolution, many points

89
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,560
on this frequency line would have to go to completely different parts of pixel space.

90
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,900
For example, let's follow a point about halfway along the frequency line.

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,660
It'll end up about halfway up the pixel space, no matter the resolution, but where

92
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,500
it is left to right can differ wildly as you go from 256x256 up to 512x512.

93
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,660
This means everyone using your software would have to re-learn how to see with their ears,

94
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
since the original intuitions of which points in space correspond to which frequencies no

95
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,720
longer apply.

96
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,460
However, with the Hilbert curve technique, as you increase the order of a pseudo-Hilbert

97
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,260
curve, a given point on the line moves around less and less, it just approaches a more specific

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,300
point in space.

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,940
That way, you've given your users the opportunity to fine-tune their intuitions, rather than

100
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,000
re-learning everything.

101
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,600
So, for this sound-to-sight application, the Hilbert curve approach turns out to be exactly

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,220
what you want.

103
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,520
In fact, given how specific the goal is, it seems almost weirdly perfect.

104
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,860
So you go back to your mathematician friend and ask her, what was the original motivation

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,540
for defining one of these curves?

106
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,200
She explains that near the end of the 19th century, in the aftershock of Cantor's research

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,980
on infinity, mathematicians were interested in finding a mapping from a one-dimensional

108
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,380
line into two-dimensional space in such a way that the line runs through every single

109
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,240
point in space.

110
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,840
To be clear, we're not talking about a finite bounded grid of pixels, like we had in the

111
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,980
sound-to-sight application.

112
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,640
This is continuous space, which is very infinite, and the goal is to have a line which is as

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,520
thin as can be and has zero area, somehow pass through every single one of those infinitely

114
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,380
many points that makes up the infinite area of space.

115
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,960
Before 1890, a lot of people thought this was obviously impossible, but then Peano discovered

116
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,240
the first of what would come to be known as space-filling curves.

117
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,400
In 1891, Hilbert followed with his own slightly simpler space-filling curve.

118
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,740
Technically, each one fills a square, not all of space, but I'll show you later on

119
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,520
how once you filled a square with a line, filling all of space is not an issue.

120
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,220
By the way, mathematicians use the word curve to talk about a line running through space

121
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,400
even if it has jagged corners.

122
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,180
This is especially counterintuitive terminology in the context of a space-filling curve, which

123
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,320
in a sense consists of nothing but sharp corners.

124
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,580
A better name might be something like space-filling fractal, which some people do use, but hey,

125
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,840
it's math, so we live with bad terminology.

126
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,780
None of the pseudo-Hilbert curves that you use to fill pixelated space would count as

127
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,560
a space-filling curve, no matter how high the order.

128
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,200
Just zoom in on one of the pixels.

129
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,620
When this pixel is considered part of infinite, continuous space, the curve only passes through

130
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,720
the tiniest zero-area slice of it, and it certainly doesn't hit every point.

131
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,720
Your mathematician friend explains that an actual bonafide Hilbert curve is not any one

132
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,140
of these pseudo-Hilbert curves.

133
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,560
Instead it's the limit of all of them.

134
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,680
Defining this limit rigorously is delicate.

135
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,640
You first have to formalize what these curves are as functions, specifically functions which

136
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,060
take in a single number somewhere between 0 and 1 as their input, and output a pair

137
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,720
of numbers.

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
This input can be thought of as a point on the line, and the output can be thought of

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,060
as coordinates in 2D space.

140
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,320
But in principle it's just an association between a single number and pairs of numbers.

141
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,500
For example, an order-2 pseudo-Hilbert curve as a function maps the input 0.3 to the output

142
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,640
pair 0.125, 0.75.

143
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,760
An order-3 pseudo-Hilbert curve maps that same input 0.3 to the output pair 0.0758,

144
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,820
0.6875.

145
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,160
Now the core property that makes a function like this a curve, and not just any ol'

146
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,300
association between single numbers and pairs of numbers, is continuity.

147
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,080
The intuition behind continuity is that you don't want the output of your function to

148
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,000
suddenly jump at any point when the input is only changing smoothly.

149
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,360
And the way this is made rigorous in math is actually pretty clever, and fully appreciating

150
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,580
space-filling curves requires digesting the formal idea of continuity, so it's definitely

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,380
worth taking a brief side-step to go over it now.

152
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,380
Consider a particular input point, a, and the corresponding output of the function,

153
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,160
b.

154
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,600
Draw a circle centered around a, and look at all the other input points inside that

155
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,060
circle, and consider where the function takes all those points in the output space.

156
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,160
Now draw the smallest circle you can centered at b that contains those outputs.

157
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,440
Different choices for the size of the input circle might result in larger or smaller circles

158
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,920
in the output space.

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,600
But notice what happens when we go through this process at a point where the function

160
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,200
jumps, drawing a circle around a, and looking at the input points within the circle, seeing

161
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,620
where they map, and drawing the smallest possible circle centered at b containing those points.

162
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,360
No matter how small the circle around a, the corresponding circle around b just cannot

163
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,940
be smaller than that jump.

164
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:13,200
For this reason, we say that the function is discontinuous at a if there's any lower

165
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,180
bound on the size of this circle that surrounds b.

166
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,340
If the circle around b can be made as small as you want, with sufficiently small choices

167
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,520
for circles around a, you say that the function is continuous at a.

168
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,760
A function as a whole is called continuous if it's continuous at every possible input

169
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,160
point.

170
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,280
Now with that as a formal definition of curves, you're ready to define what an actual Hilbert

171
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,060
curve is.

172
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,620
Doing this relies on a wonderful property of the sequence of pseudo-Hilbert curves,

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
which should feel familiar.

174
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,320
Take a given input point, like 0.3, and apply each successive pseudo-Hilbert curve function

175
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,220
to this point.

176
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,300
The corresponding outputs, as we increase the order of the curve, approaches some particular

177
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,320
point in space.

178
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,200
It doesn't matter what input you start with, this sequence of outputs you get by applying

179
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,800
each successive pseudo-Hilbert curve to this point always stabilizes and approaches some

180
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,060
particular point in 2D space.

181
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,260
This is absolutely not true, by the way, for snake curves, or for that matter most sequences

182
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,760
of curves filling pixelated space of higher and higher resolutions.

183
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,280
The outputs associated with a given input become wildly erratic as the resolution increases,

184
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,640
always jumping from left to right, and never actually approaching anything.

185
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,380
Now because of this property, we can define a Hilbert curve function like this.

186
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,720
For a given input value between 0 and 1, consider the sequence of points in 2D space you get

187
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
by applying each successive pseudo-Hilbert curve function at that point.

188
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,480
The output of the Hilbert curve function evaluated on this input is just defined to be the limit

189
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,000
of those points.

190
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,200
Because the sequence of pseudo-Hilbert curve outputs always converges no matter what input

191
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,140
you start with, this is actually a well-defined function in a way that it never could have

192
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,940
been had we used snake curves.

193
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
Now I'm not going to go through the proof for why this gives a space-filling curve,

194
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,340
but let's at least see what needs to be proved.

195
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,680
First, verify that this is a well-defined function by proving that the outputs of the

196
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,860
pseudo-Hilbert curve functions really do converge the way I'm telling you they do.

197
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,980
Second, show that this function gives a curve, meaning it's continuous.

198
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,560
Third, and most important, show that it fills space, in the sense that every single point

199
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,660
in the unit square is an output of this function.

200
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,360
I really do encourage anyone watching this to take a stab at each one of these.

201
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,860
Spoiler alert, all three of these facts turn out to be true.

202
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,560
You can extend this to a curve that fills all of space just by tiling space with squares

203
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,940
and then chaining a bunch of Hilbert curves together in a spiraling pattern of tiles,

204
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,220
connecting the end of one tile to the start of a new tile with an added little stretch

205
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,560
of line if you need to.

206
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,260
You can think of the first tile as coming from the interval from 0 to 1, the second

207
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,600
tile as coming from the interval from 1 to 2, and so on, so the entire positive real

208
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,620
number line is getting mapped into all of 2D space.

209
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,320
Take a moment to let that fact sink in.

210
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,180
A line, the platonic form of thinness itself, can wander through an infinitely extending

211
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,200
and richly dense space and hit every single point.

212
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,540
Notice, the core property that made pseudo-Hilbert curves useful in both the sound-to-sight application

213
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,900
and in their infinite origins is that points on the curve move around less and less as

214
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,860
you increase the order of those curves.

215
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,000
While translating images to sound, this was useful because it means upgrading to higher

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,940
resolutions doesn't require retraining your senses all over again.

217
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,900
For mathematicians interested in filling continuous space, this property is what ensured that

218
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,180
talking about the limit of a sequence of curves was a meaningful thing to do.

219
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,840
And this connection here between the infinite and finite worlds seems to be more of a rule

220
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,140
in math than an exception.

221
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,640
Another example that several astute commenters on the Inventing Math video pointed out is

222
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,580
the connection between the divergent sum of all powers of 2 and the way that the number

223
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,580
of 1 is represented in computers with bits.

224
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,280
It's not so much that the infinite result is directly useful, but instead the same patterns

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,080
and constructs that are used to define and prove infinite facts have finite analogs,

226
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,120
and these finite analogs are directly useful.

227
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,600
But the connection is often deeper than a mere analogy.

228
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,520
Many theorems about an infinite object are often equivalent to some theorem regarding

229
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,380
a family of finite objects.

230
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,120
For example, if during your sound-to-sight project you were to sit down and really formalize

231
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,020
what it means for your curve to stay stable as you increase camera resolution, you would

232
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,580
end up effectively writing the definition of what it means for a sequence of curves

233
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,460
to have a limit.

234
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,680
In fact, a statement about some infinite object, whether that's a sequence or a fractal,

235
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,920
can usually be viewed as a particularly clean way to encapsulate a truth about a family

236
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,280
of finite objects.

237
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,800
The lesson to take away here is that even when a statement seems very far removed from

238
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,360
reality, you should always be willing to look under the hood and at the nuts and bolts of

239
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,740
what's really being said.

240
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,520
Who knows, you might find insights for representing numbers from divergent sums, or for seeing

241
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,420
with your ears from filling space.
