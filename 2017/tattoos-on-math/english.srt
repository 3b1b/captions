00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Hey folks, just a short, out of the ordinary video for you today.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
A friend of mine, Cam, recently got a math tattoo.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,640
It's not something I'd recommend, but he told his team at work that if they reached

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,700
a certain stretch goal, it's something he'd do.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,160
And well, the incentive worked.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,680
Cam's initials are CSC, which happens to be the shorthand for the cosecant function

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,160
in trigonometry.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,740
So what he decided to do was make his tattoo a certain geometric representation of what

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,080
that function means.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,680
It's kind of like a wordless signature written in pure math.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,080
It got me thinking, though, about why on earth we teach students about the trigonometric

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,600
functions cosecant, secant, and cotangent, and it occurred to me that there's something

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,920
kind of poetic about this particular tattoo.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,340
Just as tattoos are artificially painted on, but become permanent, as if they were a core

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,500
part of the recipient's flesh.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,760
The fact that the cosecant is a named function is kind of an artificial construct on math.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Trigonometry could just as well have existed intact without the cosecant ever being named,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,700
but because it was, it has this strange and artificial permanence in our conventions,

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,580
and to some extent in our education system.

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,020
In other words, the cosecant is not just a tattoo on Cam's chest, it's a tattoo on

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,460
math itself, something which seemed reasonable and even worthy of immortality at its inception,

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,000
but which doesn't necessarily hold up as time goes on.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,860
Here, let me show you a picture of the tattoo he chose, because not a lot of people know

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,760
the geometric representation of the cosecant.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,080
Whenever you have an angle, typically represented with the Greek letter theta, it's common

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,080
in trigonometry to relate it to a corresponding point on the unit circle, the circle with

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,640
a radius 1 centered at the origin in the xy plane.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,580
Most trigonometry students learn that the distance between this point here on the circle

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,360
and the x-axis is the sine of the angle, and the distance between that point and the y-axis

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,480
is the cosine of the angle.

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,720
These links give a really wonderful understanding for what cosine and sine are all about.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,280
People might learn that the tangent of an angle is sine divided by cosine, and that

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,080
the cotangent is the other way around, cosine divided by sine, but relatively few learn

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,720
that there's also a nice geometric interpretation for each of those quantities.

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,200
If you draw a line tangent to the circle at this point, the distance from that point to

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,680
the x-axis along that tangent is the tangent of the angle, and the distance along that

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,280
line to the point where it hits the y-axis is the cotangent of the angle.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,300
Again, this gives a really intuitive feel for what those quantities mean.

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,260
You can imagine tweaking that theta and seeing when cotangent gets smaller and when tangent

40
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,420
gets larger, and it's a good gut check for any students working with them.

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,460
Likewise, secant, which is defined as 1 divided by the cosine, and cosecant, which is defined

42
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,820
as 1 divided by the sine of theta, each have their own places on this diagram.

43
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,780
If you look at that point where this tangent line crosses the x-axis, the distance from

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,820
that point to the origin is the secant of the angle, that is 1 divided by the cosine.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,340
Likewise, the distance between where this tangent line crosses the y-axis and the origin

46
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,940
is the cosecant of the angle, that is 1 divided by the sine.

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,940
If you're wondering why on earth that's true, notice that we have two similar right

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,740
triangles here, one small one inside the circle, and this larger triangle whose hypotenuse

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
is resting on the y-axis.

50
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,420
I'll leave it to you to check that the interior angle up at the tip there is theta, the angle

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,020
that we originally started with over inside the circle.

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,020
For each one of those triangles, think about the ratio of the length of the side opposite

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,940
theta to the length of the hypotenuse.

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,100
For the small triangle, the length of the opposite side is sine of theta, and the hypotenuse

55
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,220
is that radius, the one we defined to have length 1, so the ratio is just sine of theta

56
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,440
divided by 1.

57
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,560
The larger triangle, the side opposite theta, is the radial line of length 1, and the hypotenuse

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,200
is now this length on the y-axis, the one I'm claiming is the cosecant.

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,320
If you take the reciprocal of each side here, you see that this matches up with the fact

60
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,040
that the cosecant of theta is 1 divided by sine.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Kinda cool, right?

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,660
It's also kind of nice that sine, tangent, and secant all correspond to lengths of lines

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,580
that somehow go to the x-axis, and then the corresponding cosine, cotangent, and cosecant

64
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,300
are all then lengths of lines going to the corresponding spots on the y-axis.

65
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,420
And on a diagram like this, it might be pleasing that all six of these are separately named

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,720
functions.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,860
But in any practical use of trigonometry, you can get by just using sine, cosine, and

68
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
tangent.

69
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,180
In fact, if you really wanted, you could define all six of these in terms of sine alone.

70
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,020
But the sort of things that cosine and tangent correspond to come up frequently enough that

71
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,740
it's more convenient to give them their own names.

72
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,180
But cosecant, secant, and cotangent never really come up in problem solving in a way

73
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,180
that's not just as convenient to write in terms of sine, cosine, and tangent.

74
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,180
At that point, it's really just adding more words for students to learn with not that

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,060
much added utility.

76
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,000
And if anything, if you only introduce secant as 1 over cosine and cosecant as 1 over sine,

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,400
the mismatch of this co- prefix is probably just an added point of confusion in a class

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,960
that's prone enough to confusion for many of its students.

79
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,880
The reason that all six of these functions have separate names, by the way, is that before

80
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,320
computers and calculators, if you were doing trigonometry, maybe because you're a sailor,

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,600
or an astronomer, or some kind of engineer, you'd find the values for these functions

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,400
using large charts that just recorded known input-output pairs.

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,560
And when you can't easily plug in something like 1 divided by the sine of 30 degrees into

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,280
a calculator, it might actually make sense to have a dedicated column to this value,

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
with a dedicated name.

86
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,720
And if you have a diagram like this one in mind when you're taking measurements, with

87
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,280
sine, tangent, and secant having nicely mirrored meanings to cosine, cotangent, and cosecant,

88
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,320
calling this cosecant instead of 1 divided by sine might actually make some sense, and

89
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,360
it might actually make it easier to remember what it means geometrically.

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,680
But times have changed, and most use cases for trig just don't involve charts of values

91
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,280
in diagrams like this.

92
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,640
Hence, the cosecant, and its brothers, are tattoos on math, ideas whose permanence in

93
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,240
our conventions is our own doing, not the result of nature itself.

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,360
And in general, I actually think this is a good lesson for any student learning a new

95
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,740
piece of math, at whatever level.

96
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,520
You just gotta take a moment and ask yourself whether what you're learning is core to

97
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,120
the flesh of math itself, and to nature itself, or if what you're looking at is actually

98
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,480
just inked on to the subject, and could just as easily have been inked on in some completely

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,980
other way.
