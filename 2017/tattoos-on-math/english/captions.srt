00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:07,480
Hey folks, just a short, out of the ordinary video for you today.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,780
A friend of mine, Cam, recently got a math tattoo.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,992
It's not something I'd recommend, but he told his team at work 

4
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:16,920
that if they reached a certain stretch goal, it's something he'd do.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,420
And well, the incentive worked.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,690
Cam's initials are CSC, which happens to be the 

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,540
shorthand for the cosecant function in trigonometry.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,942
So what he decided to do is make his tattoo a certain 

9
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,880
geometric representation of what that function means.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,600
It's kind of like a wordless signature written in pure math.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,705
It got me thinking, though, about why on earth we teach students about 

12
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:42,631
the trigonometric functions cosecant, secant, and cotangent, 

13
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:46,900
and it occurred to me that there's something kind of poetic about this particular tattoo.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,584
Just as tattoos are artificially painted on, but become 

15
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,740
permanent as if they were a core part of the recipient's flesh.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,500
The fact that the cosecant is a named function is kind of an artificial construct on math.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,407
Trigonometry could just as well have existed intact without the cosecant 

18
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:08,515
ever being named, but because it was, it has this strange and artificial 

19
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:12,680
permanence in our conventions, and to some extent in our education system.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,575
In other words, the cosecant is not just a tattoo on Cam's chest, 

21
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:22,540
it's a tattoo on math itself, something which seemed reasonable and even worthy 

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,940
of immortality at its inception, but which doesn't necessarily hold up as time goes on.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,278
Here, let me show you a picture of the tattoo he chose, 

24
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:35,400
because not a lot of people know the geometric representation of the cosecant.

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,974
Whenever you have an angle, typically represented with the Greek letter theta, 

26
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:45,757
it's common in trigonometry to relate it to a corresponding point on the unit circle, 

27
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:49,540
the circle with the radius 1 centered at the origin in the xy plane.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,169
Most trigonometry students learn that the distance between this point 

29
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,417
here on the circle and the x-axis is the sine of the angle, 

30
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,640
and the distance between that point and the y-axis is the cosine of the angle.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,750
And these links give a really wonderful understanding 

32
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,520
for what cosine and sine are all about.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,990
People might learn that the tangent of an angle is sine divided by cosine, 

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,730
and that relatively few learn that there's also a nice geometric 

35
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,940
interpretation for each of those quantities.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,630
If you draw a line tangent to the circle at this point, 

37
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,820
the distance from that point to the x-axis along that tangent is the tangent of the angle.

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,258
And the distance along that line to the point where 

39
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:37,820
it hits the y-axis is the cotangent of the angle.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,920
Again, this gives a really intuitive feel for what those quantities mean.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,856
You can imagine tweaking that theta and seeing when cotangent gets smaller and when 

42
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:49,700
tangent gets larger, and it's a good gut check for any students working with them.

43
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,180
Likewise, secant, which is defined as 1 divided by the cosine, and cosecant, 

44
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,180
which is defined as 1 divided by the sine of theta, 

45
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,660
each have their own places on this diagram.

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,073
If you look at that point where this tangent line crosses the x-axis, 

47
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:10,489
the distance from that point to the origin is the secant of the angle, 

48
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,480
that is 1 divided by the cosine.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,450
Likewise, the distance between where this tangent line crosses the y-axis 

50
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,840
and the origin is the cosecant of the angle, that is 1 divided by the sine.

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,387
If you're wondering why on earth that's true, notice that we have 

52
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:30,274
two similar right triangles here, one small one inside the circle, 

53
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:34,160
and this larger triangle whose hypotenuse is resting on the y-axis.

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,343
I'll leave it to you to check that the interior angle up at the tip there is theta, 

55
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,580
the angle that we originally started with over inside the circle.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,521
For each one of those triangles, I want you to think about the ratio of 

57
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:50,140
the length of the side opposite theta to the length of the hypotenuse.

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,205
For the small triangle, the length of the opposite side is sine of theta, 

59
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:59,414
and the hypotenuse is that radius, the one we defined to have length 1, 

60
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:02,220
so the ratio is just sine of theta divided by 1.

61
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,392
Now, when we look at the larger triangle, the side opposite 

62
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:10,065
theta is that radial line of length 1, and the hypotenuse is 

63
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:14,160
now this length on the y-axis, the one I'm claiming is the cosecant.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,347
If you take the reciprocal of each side here, you see that this 

65
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:23,120
matches up with the fact that the cosecant of theta is 1 divided by sine.

66
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,700
Kinda cool, right?

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,331
It's also kind of nice that sine, tangent, and secant all correspond to lengths of 

68
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:35,142
lines that somehow go to the x-axis, and then the corresponding cosine, cotangent, 

69
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:40,360
and cosecant are all then lengths of lines going to the corresponding spots on the y-axis.

70
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,466
And on a diagram like this, it might be pleasing 

71
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,940
that all six of these are separately named functions.

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,290
But in any practical use of trigonometry, you can get by just using sine, 

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,320
cosine, and tangent.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,880
In fact, if you really wanted, you could define all six of these in terms of sine alone.

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,800
But the sort of things that cosine and tangent correspond to come up 

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,060
frequently enough that it's more convenient to give them their own names.

77
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,880
But cosecant, secant, and cotangent never really come up in problem solving in a 

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,020
way that's not just as convenient to write in terms of sine, cosine, and tangent.

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,769
At that point, it's really just adding more words for students to learn, 

80
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,220
with not that much added utility.

81
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,432
And if anything, if you only introduce secant as 1 over cosine, 

82
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:25,748
and cosecant as 1 over sine, the mismatch of this co-prefix is probably just an 

83
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:29,956
added point of confusion in a class that's prone enough to confusion for many 

84
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:30,820
of its students.

85
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,807
The reason that all six of these functions have separate names, by the way, 

86
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:39,534
is that before computers and calculators, if you were doing trigonometry, 

87
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:43,311
maybe because you're a sailor, or an astronomer, or some kind of engineer, 

88
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:47,340
you'd find the values for these functions using large charts that just recorded 

89
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,600
known input-output pairs.

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,198
And when you can't easily plug in something like 1 divided by the 

91
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,850
sine of 30 degrees into a calculator, it might actually make sense 

92
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,340
to have a dedicated column to this value, with a dedicated name.

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,296
And if you have a diagram like this one in mind when you're taking measurements, 

94
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:08,511
with sine, tangent, and secant having nicely mirrored meanings to cosine, cotangent, 

95
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:12,726
and cosecant, calling this cosecant instead of 1 divided by sine might actually make 

96
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:17,140
some sense, and it might actually make it easier to remember what it means geometrically.

97
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,062
But times have changed, and most use cases for trig just 

98
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:24,020
don't involve charts of values and diagrams like this.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,933
Hence, the cosecant and its brothers are tattoos on math, 

100
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:31,381
ideas whose permanence in our conventions is our own doing, 

101
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:33,220
not the result of nature itself.

102
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,599
And in general, I actually think this is a good lesson for 

103
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,100
any student learning a new piece of math, at whatever level.

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,977
You just gotta take a moment and ask yourself whether what you're 

105
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:46,417
learning is core to the flesh of math itself, and to nature itself, 

106
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:50,007
or if what you're looking at is actually just inked on to the subject, 

107
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:53,700
and could just as easily have been inked on in some completely other way.
