  "And if you have a diagram like this one in mind when you're taking measurements, with sine, tangent, and secant having nicely mirrored meanings to cosine, cotangent, and cosecant, calling this cosecant instead of 1 divided by sine might actually make some sense, and it might actually make it easier to remember what it means geometrically.",
