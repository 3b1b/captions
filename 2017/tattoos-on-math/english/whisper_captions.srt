00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,480
Hey folks, just a short, out of the ordinary video for you today.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,780
A friend of mine, Cam, recently got a math tattoo.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,660
It's not something I'd recommend, but he told his team at work that if they reached

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,920
a certain stretch goal, it's something he'd do.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,420
And well, the incentive worked.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,700
Cam's initials are CSC, which happens to be the shorthand for the cosecant function

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,540
in trigonometry.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,780
So what he decided to do is make his tattoo a certain geometric representation of what

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,880
that function means.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,600
It's kind of like a wordless signature written in pure math.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,060
It got me thinking, though, about why on earth we teach students about the trigonometric

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,640
functions cosecant, secant, and cotangent, and it occurred to me that there's something

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,900
kind of poetic about this particular tattoo.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,400
Just as tattoos are artificially painted on, but become permanent as if they were a core

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,740
part of the recipient's flesh.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,500
The fact that the cosecant is a named function is kind of an artificial construct on math.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,180
Trigonometry could just as well have existed intact without the cosecant ever being named,

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,120
but because it was, it has this strange and artificial permanence in our conventions,

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,680
and to some extent in our education system.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,080
In other words, the cosecant is not just a tattoo on Cam's chest, it's a tattoo on

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,860
math itself, something which seemed reasonable and even worthy of immortality at its inception,

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,940
but which doesn't necessarily hold up as time goes on.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
Here, let me show you a picture of the tattoo he chose, because not a lot of people know

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,400
the geometric representation of the cosecant.

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,080
Whenever you have an angle, typically represented with the Greek letter theta, it's common

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,100
in trigonometry to relate it to a corresponding point on the unit circle, the circle with

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,540
the radius 1 centered at the origin in the xy plane.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,400
Most trigonometry students learn that the distance between this point here on the circle

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,980
and the x-axis is the sine of the angle, and the distance between that point and the y-axis

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,640
is the cosine of the angle.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,520
And these links give a really wonderful understanding for what cosine and sine are all about.

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,080
People might learn that the tangent of an angle is sine divided by cosine, and that

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
relatively few learn that there's also a nice geometric interpretation for each of

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,940
those quantities.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,300
If you draw a line tangent to the circle at this point, the distance from that point to

36
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,820
the x-axis along that tangent is the tangent of the angle.

37
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,240
And the distance along that line to the point where it hits the y-axis is the cotangent

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,820
of the angle.

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,920
Again, this gives a really intuitive feel for what those quantities mean.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,260
You can imagine tweaking that theta and seeing when cotangent gets smaller and when tangent

41
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,700
gets larger, and it's a good gut check for any students working with them.

42
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,460
Likewise, secant, which is defined as 1 divided by the cosine, and cosecant, which is defined

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,660
as 1 divided by the sine of theta, each have their own places on this diagram.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,760
If you look at that point where this tangent line crosses the x-axis, the distance from

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,480
that point to the origin is the secant of the angle, that is 1 divided by the cosine.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,820
Likewise, the distance between where this tangent line crosses the y-axis and the origin

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,840
is the cosecant of the angle, that is 1 divided by the sine.

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,000
If you're wondering why on earth that's true, notice that we have two similar right

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,820
triangles here, one small one inside the circle, and this larger triangle whose hypotenuse

50
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,160
is resting on the y-axis.

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,460
I'll leave it to you to check that the interior angle up at the tip there is theta, the angle

52
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,580
that we originally started with over inside the circle.

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,060
For each one of those triangles, I want you to think about the ratio of the length of

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,140
the side opposite theta to the length of the hypotenuse.

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,200
For the small triangle, the length of the opposite side is sine of theta, and the hypotenuse

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,380
is that radius, the one we defined to have length 1, so the ratio is just sine of theta

57
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,220
divided by 1.

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,280
Now, when we look at the larger triangle, the side opposite theta is that radial line

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,200
of length 1, and the hypotenuse is now this length on the y-axis, the one I'm claiming

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,160
is the cosecant.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,340
If you take the reciprocal of each side here, you see that this matches up with the fact

62
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,120
that the cosecant of theta is 1 divided by sine.

63
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,700
Kinda cool, right?

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,680
It's also kind of nice that sine, tangent, and secant all correspond to lengths of lines

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,260
that somehow go to the x-axis, and then the corresponding cosine, cotangent, and cosecant

66
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,360
are all then lengths of lines going to the corresponding spots on the y-axis.

67
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,420
And on a diagram like this, it might be pleasing that all six of these are separately named

68
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,940
functions.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,960
But in any practical use of trigonometry, you can get by just using sine, cosine, and

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,320
tangent.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,880
In fact, if you really wanted, you could define all six of these in terms of sine alone.

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,020
But the sort of things that cosine and tangent correspond to come up frequently enough that

73
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,060
it's more convenient to give them their own names.

74
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,040
But cosecant, secant, and cotangent never really come up in problem solving in a way

75
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,020
that's not just as convenient to write in terms of sine, cosine, and tangent.

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,200
At that point, it's really just adding more words for students to learn, with not that

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,220
much added utility.

78
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,420
And if anything, if you only introduce secant as 1 over cosine, and cosecant as 1 over sine,

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,280
the mismatch of this co-prefix is probably just an added point of confusion in a class

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,820
that's prone enough to confusion for many of its students.

81
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,920
The reason that all six of these functions have separate names, by the way, is that before

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,080
computers and calculators, if you were doing trigonometry, maybe because you're a sailor,

83
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,560
or an astronomer, or some kind of engineer, you'd find the values for these functions

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,600
using large charts that just recorded known input-output pairs.

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,600
And when you can't easily plug in something like 1 divided by the sine of 30 degrees into

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,000
a calculator, it might actually make sense to have a dedicated column to this value,

87
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,340
with a dedicated name.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,800
And if you have a diagram like this one in mind when you're taking measurements, with

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,640
sine, tangent, and secant having nicely mirrored meanings to cosine, cotangent, and cosecant,

90
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,280
calling this cosecant instead of 1 divided by sine might actually make some sense, and

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,140
it might actually make it easier to remember what it means geometrically.

92
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,680
But times have changed, and most use cases for trig just don't involve charts of values

93
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,020
and diagrams like this.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,260
Hence, the cosecant and its brothers are tattoos on math, ideas whose permanence in our conventions

95
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,220
is our own doing, not the result of nature itself.

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,460
And in general, I actually think this is a good lesson for any student learning a new

97
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,100
piece of math, at whatever level.

98
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,520
You just gotta take a moment and ask yourself whether what you're learning is core to

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,120
the flesh of math itself, and to nature itself, or if what you're looking at is actually

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,440
just inked on to the subject, and could just as easily have been inked on in some completely

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,980
other way.
