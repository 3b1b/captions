1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,520
Who doesn't like fractals? They're a beautiful blend of simplicity and complexity, often

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,260
including these infinitely repeating patterns. Programmers in particular tend to be especially

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,580
fond of them, because it takes a shockingly small amount of code to produce images that

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,340
are way more intricate than any human hand ever could hope to draw. But a lot of people

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,960
don't actually know the definition of a fractal, at least not the one Benoit Mandelbrot,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,580
the father of fractal geometry, had in mind. A common misconception is that fractals are

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,240
shapes that are perfectly self-similar. For example, this snowflake-looking shape right

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,120
here, called the Von Koch snowflake, consists of three different segments, and each one

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,800
of these is perfectly self-similar, in that when you zoom in on it, you get a perfectly

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,060
identical copy of the original. Likewise, the famous Sierpinski triangle consists of

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,760
three smaller identical copies of itself. And don't get me wrong, self-similar shapes

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,260
are definitely beautiful, and they're a good toy model for what fractals really are. But

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,900
Mandelbrot had a much broader conception in mind, one motivated not by beauty, but more

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,660
by a pragmatic desire to model nature in a way that actually captures roughness. In some

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,260
ways, fractal geometry is a rebellion against calculus, whose central assumption is that

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,960
things tend to look smooth if you zoom in far enough. But Mandelbrot saw this as overly

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,260
idealized, or at least needlessly idealized, resulting in models that neglect the finer

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,120
details of the thing they're actually modeling, which can matter. What he observed is that

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,860
self-similar shapes give a basis for modeling the regularity in some forms of roughness,

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,100
but the popular perception that fractals only include perfectly self-similar shapes is another

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,560
over-idealization, one that ironically goes against the pragmatic spirit of fractal geometry's

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,660
origins. The real definition of fractals has to do with this idea of fractal dimension,

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,200
the main topic of this video. You see, there is a sense, a certain way to define the word

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,860
dimension, in which the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.585D, that the Von Koch

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:13,500
curve is approximately 1.262D. The coastline of Britain turns out to be around 1.21D, and

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,520
in general it's possible to have shapes whose dimension is any positive real number,

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
not just whole numbers.

28
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,580
I think when I first heard someone reference fractional dimension like this, I just thought

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,760
it was nonsense, right? I mean, mathematicians are clearly just making stuff up. Dimension

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,200
is something that usually only makes sense for natural numbers, right? A line is one-dimensional,

31
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,160
a plane that's two-dimensional, the space that we live in that's three-dimensional,

32
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,640
and so on. And in fact, any linear algebra student who just learned the formal definition

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,300
of dimension in that context would agree, it only makes sense for counting numbers.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,180
And of course, the idea of fractal dimension is just made up. I mean, this is math, everything's

35
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,680
made up. But the question is whether or not it turns out to be a useful construct for

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,260
modeling the world. And I think you'll agree, once you learn how fractal dimension is defined,

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,620
it's something that you start seeing almost everywhere that you look. It actually helps

38
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,260
to start the discussion here by only looking at perfectly self-similar shapes. In fact,

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm going to start with four shapes, the first three of which aren't even fractals.

40
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,200
A line, a square, a cube, and a Sierpinski triangle. All of these shapes are self-similar.

41
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,280
A line can be broken up into two smaller lines, each of which is a perfect copy of the original,

42
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,920
just scaled down by a half. A square can be broken down into four smaller squares, each

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,680
of which is a perfect copy of the original, just scaled down by a half. Likewise, a cube

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,740
can be broken down into eight smaller cubes, again, each one is a scaled down version by

45
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:50,000
one half. And the core characteristic of the Sierpinski triangle is that it's made of three

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
smaller copies of itself, and the length of the side of one of those smaller copies is

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,980
one half the side length of the original triangle. Now, it's fun to compare how we measure these

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,120
things. We'd say that the smaller line is one half the length of the original line,

49
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,460
the smaller square is one quarter the area of the original square, the smaller cube is

50
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,680
one eighth the volume of the original cube, and that smaller Sierpinski triangle? Well,

51
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,200
we'll talk about how to measure that in just a moment. What I want is a word that generalizes

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,660
the idea of length, area, and volume, but that I can apply to all of those shapes and

53
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,400
more. And typically in math, the word that you'd use for this is measure, but I think

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,100
it might be more intuitive to talk about mass, as in, imagine that each of these shapes is

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,480
made out of metal, a thin wire, a flat sheet, a solid cube, and some kind of Sierpinski mesh.

56
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,620
Fractal dimension has everything to do with understanding how the mass of these shapes

57
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,500
changes as you scale them. The benefit of starting the discussion with self-similar

58
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,120
shapes is that it gives us a nice clear-cut way to compare masses. When you scale down that line

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,000
by one half, the mass is also scaled down by one half, which you can viscerally see because it takes

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,540
two copies of that smaller one to form the whole. When you scale down a square by one half, its mass

61
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,120
is scaled down by one fourth, where again you can see this by piecing together four of the smaller

62
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:22,600
copies to get the original. Likewise, when you scale down that cube by one half, the mass is

63
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,460
scaled down by one eighth, or one half cubed, because it takes eight copies of that smaller

64
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,900
cube to rebuild the original. And when you scale down the Sierpinski triangle by a factor of a

65
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,420
half, wouldn't you agree that it makes sense to say that its mass goes down by a factor of one

66
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,640
third? I mean, it takes exactly three of those smaller ones to form the original. But notice

67
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,000
that for the line, the square, and the cube, the factor by which the mass changed is this nice

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,760
clean integer power of one half. In fact, that exponent is the dimension of each shape. And

69
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,980
what's more, you could say that what it means for a shape to be, for example, two-dimensional,

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,720
what puts the two in two-dimensional, is that when you scale it by some factor, its mass is

71
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,880
scaled by that factor raised to the second power. And maybe what it means for a shape to be

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,360
three-dimensional is that when you scale it by some factor, the mass is scaled by the third power

73
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:35,520
of that factor. So if this is our conception of dimension, what should the dimensionality of a

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,260
Sierpinski triangle be? You'd want to say that when you scale it down by a factor of one half,

75
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,220
its mass goes down by one half to the power of whatever its dimension is. And because it's

76
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,260
self-similar, we know that we want its mass to go down by a factor of one third. So what's the

77
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:00,140
number d such that raising one half to the power of d gives you one third? Well, that's the same

78
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,640
as asking two to the what equals three, the quintessential type of question that logarithms

79
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,060
are meant to answer. And when you go and plug in log base two of three to a calculator, what you'll

80
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,700
find is that it's about 1.585. So in this way, the Sierpinski triangle is not one-dimensional,

81
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,000
even though you could define a curve that passes through all its points, and nor is it two-dimensional,

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,300
even though it lives in the plane. Instead, it's 1.585 dimensional. And if you want to describe its

83
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,880
mass, neither length nor area seem like the fitting notions. If you tried, its length would

84
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,280
turn out to be infinite, and its area would turn out to be zero. Instead, what you want is whatever

85
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:48,400
the 1.585 dimensional analog of length is. Here, let's look at another self-similar fractal, the

86
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,100
von Koch curve. This one is composed of four smaller identical copies of itself, each of which

87
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,980
is a copy of the original scaled down by one third. So the scaling factor is one third, and the mass

88
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:07,040
has gone down by a factor of one fourth. So that means the dimension should be some number D, so

89
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,340
that when we raise one third to the power of D, it gives us one fourth. Well, that's the same as

90
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,560
saying three to the what equals four, so you can go and plug into a calculator log base three of

91
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,320
four, and that comes out to be around 1.262. So in a sense, the von Koch curve is a 1.262

92
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,120
dimensional shape. Here's another fun one. This is kind of the right angled version of the Koch

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,400
curve. It's built up of eight scaled down copies of itself, where the scaling factor here is one

94
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:49,300
fourth. So if you want to know its dimension, it should be some number D, such that one fourth to

95
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:57,220
the power of D equals one eighth, the factor by which the mass just decreased. And in this case,

96
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,500
the value we want is log base four of eight, and that's exactly three halves. So evidently,

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,440
this fractal is precisely 1.5 dimensional. Does that kind of make sense? It's weird, but it's

98
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,500
all just about scaling and comparing masses while you scale. And what I've described so far,

99
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,140
everything up to this point is what you might call self-similarity dimension. It does a good

100
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,700
job making the idea of fractional dimension seem at least somewhat reasonable, but there's a

101
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,100
problem. It's not really a general notion. I mean, when we were reasoning about how a mass's shape

102
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,000
should change, it relied on the self-similarity of the shapes, that you could build them up from

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,660
smaller copies of themselves. But that seems unnecessarily restrictive. After all, most

104
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,320
two-dimensional shapes are not at all self-similar. Consider the disk, the interior of a circle. We

105
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,200
know that's two-dimensional, and you could say that this is because when you scale it up by a

106
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,000
factor of two, its mass, proportional to the area, gets scaled by the square of that factor, in this

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,500
case four. But it's not like there's some way to piece together four copies of that smaller circle

108
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,660
to rebuild the original. So how do we know that that bigger disk is exactly four times the mass

109
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,800
of the original? Answering that requires a way to make this idea of mass a little more mathematically

110
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,420
rigorous, since we're not dealing with physical objects made of matter, are we? We're dealing

111
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,720
with purely geometric ones living in an abstract space. And there's a couple ways to think about

112
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,420
this, but here's a common one. Cover the plane with a grid, and highlight all of the grid squares

113
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,280
that are touching the disk, and now count how many there are. In the back of our minds, we already

114
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,860
know that a disk is two-dimensional, and the number of grid squares that it touches should be

115
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,800
proportional to its area. A clever way to verify this empirically is to scale up that disk by some

116
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,320
factor, like two, and count how many grid squares touch this new scaled-up version. What you should

117
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,680
find is that that number has increased approximately in proportion to the square of our scaling factor,

118
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,960
which in this case means about four times as many boxes. Well, admittedly what's on the screen here

119
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,540
might not look that convincing, but it's just because the grid is really coarse. If instead you

120
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,580
took a much finer grid, one that more tightly captures the intent we're going for here by

121
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,500
measuring the size of the circle, that relationship of quadrupling the number of boxes touched when

122
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,460
you scale the disk by a factor of two should shine through more clearly. I'll admit though that when

123
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:36,940
I was animating this, I was surprised by just how slowly this value converges to four. Here's one

124
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:54,940
example. For larger and larger scaling values, which is actually equivalent to just looking at a

125
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:03,620
finer grid, that data is going to more perfectly fit that parabola. Now getting back to fractals,

126
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,340
let's play this game with the Sierpinski triangle, counting how many boxes are touching points in

127
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,160
that shape. How would you imagine that number compares to scaling up the triangle by a factor

128
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,660
of two and counting the new number of boxes touched? Well, the proportion of boxes touched

129
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,260
by the big one to the number of boxes touched by the small one should be about three. After all,

130
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,140
that bigger version is just built up of three copies of the smaller version. You could also

131
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,820
think about this as two raised to the dimension of the fractal, which we just saw is about 1.585.

132
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,880
And so if you were to go and plot the scaling factor in this case against the number of boxes

133
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,760
touched by the Sierpinski triangle, the data would closely fit a curve with the shape of y equals x

134
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,700
to the power 1.585, just multiplied by some proportionality constant. But importantly,

135
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,400
the whole reason that I'm talking about this is that we can play the same game with non-self-similar

136
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,660
shapes that still have some kind of roughness. And the classic example here is the coastline

137
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,940
of Britain. If you plop that coastline into the plane and count how many boxes are touching it,

138
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,500
and then scale it by some amount, and count how many boxes are touching that new scaled version,

139
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,820
what you'd find is that the number of boxes touching the coastline increases approximately

140
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:28,880
in proportion to the scaling factor raised to the power of 1.21. Here, it's kind of fun to

141
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,880
think about how you would actually compute that number empirically. As in,

142
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,040
imagine I give you some shape, and you're a savvy programmer. How would you find this number?

143
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,420
So what I'm saying here is that if you scale this shape by some factor, which I'll call S,

144
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,020
the number of boxes touching that shape should equal some constant multiplied by that scaling

145
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,400
factor raised to whatever the dimension is, the value that we're looking for. Now,

146
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,840
if you have some data plot that closely fits a curve that looks like the input raised to some

147
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,460
power, it can be hard to see exactly what that power should be. So a common trick is to take

148
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,460
the logarithm of both sides. That way, the dimension is going to drop down from the exponent,

149
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,060
and we'll have a nice clean linear relationship. What this suggests is that if you were to plot

150
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,260
the log of the scaling factor against the log of the number of boxes touching the coastline,

151
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,360
the relationship should look like a line, and that line should have a slope equal to the dimension.

152
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,580
So what that means is that if you tried out a whole bunch of scaling factors, counted the

153
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,540
number of boxes touching the coast in each instant, and then plotted the points on the

154
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,900
log-log plot, you could then do some kind of linear regression to find the best fit line to

155
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,120
your data set, and when you look at the slope of that line, that tells you the empirical measurement

156
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,580
for the dimension of what you're examining. I just think that makes this idea of fractal dimension

157
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,420
so much more real and visceral compared to abstract, artificially perfect shapes. And once

158
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,760
you're comfortable thinking about dimension like this, you, my friend, have become ready to hear

159
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:14,880
the definition of a fractal. Essentially, fractals are shapes whose dimension is not an integer, but

160
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,400
instead some fractional amount. What's cool about that is that it's a quantitative way to say that

161
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,840
they're shapes that are rough, and that they stay rough even as you zoom in. Technically, there's a

162
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,140
slightly more accurate definition, and I've included it in the video description, but this idea here of

163
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:38,720
a non-integer dimension almost entirely captures the idea of roughness that we're going for. There

164
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,860
is one nuance though that I haven't brought up yet, but it's worth pointing out, which is that

165
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,220
this dimension, at least as I've described it so far using the box counting method, can sometimes

166
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:55,220
change based on how far zoomed in you are. For example, here's a shape sitting in three dimensions

167
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,580
which at a distance looks like a line. In 3D, by the way, when you do a box counting you have a 3D

168
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,620
grid full of little cubes instead of little squares, but it works the same way. At this scale, where the

169
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,580
shape's thickness is smaller than the size of the boxes, it looks one-dimensional, meaning the number

170
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,980
of boxes it touches is proportional to its length. But when you scale it up, it starts behaving a lot

171
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,820
more like a tube, touching the boxes on the surface of that tube, and so it'll look two-dimensional,

172
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,420
with the number of boxes touched being proportional to the square of the scaling factor. But it's not

173
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,940
really a tube, it's made of these rapidly winding little curves, so once you scale it up even more,

174
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,920
to the point where the boxes can pick up on the details of those curves, it looks one-dimensional

175
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,360
again, with the number of boxes touched scaling directly in proportion to the scaling constant.

176
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,940
So actually assigning a number to a shape for its dimension can be tricky, and it leaves room for

177
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:03,800
differing definitions and differing conventions. In a pure math setting, there are indeed numerous

178
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,660
definitions for dimension, but all of them focus on what the limit of this dimension is at closer

179
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:18,380
and closer zoom levels. You can think of that in terms of the plot as the limit of this slope as

180
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,080
you move farther and farther to the right. So for a purely geometric shape to be a genuine fractal,

181
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,540
it has to continue looking rough, even as you zoom in infinitely far. But in a more applied setting,

182
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,340
like looking at the coastline of Britain, it doesn't really make sense to talk about the limit

183
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,420
as you zoom in more and more. I mean, at some point you'd just be hitting atoms. Instead what

184
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,900
you do is you look at a sufficiently wide range of scales from very zoomed out up to very zoomed in,

185
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,760
and compute the dimension at each one. And in this more applied setting, a shape is typically

186
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,700
considered to be a fractal only when the measured dimension stays approximately constant even across

187
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,680
multiple different scales. For example, the coastline of Britain doesn't just look 1.21

188
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,740
dimensional at a distance. Even if you zoom in by a factor of a thousand, the level of roughness

189
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,000
is still around 1.21. That right there is the sense in which many shapes from nature actually

190
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,280
are self-similar, albeit not perfect self-similarity. Perfectly self-similar shapes do

191
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,840
play an important role in fractal geometry. What they give us are simple to describe,

192
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,240
low-information examples of this phenomenon of roughness, roughness that persists at many

193
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,640
different scales and at arbitrarily close scales. And that's important, it gives us the primitive

194
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,980
tools for modeling these fractal phenomena. But I think it's also important not to view them as

195
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,440
the prototypical example of fractals, since fractals in general actually have a lot more

196
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:53,760
character to them. I really do think that this is one of those ideas where once you learn it,

197
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,520
it makes you start looking at the world completely differently. What this number is, what this

198
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,800
fractional dimension gives us is a quantitative way to describe roughness. For example,

199
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,540
the coastline of Norway is about 1.52 dimensional, which is a numerical way to communicate the fact

200
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,360
that it's way more jaggedy than Britain's coastline. The surface of a calm ocean might

201
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,240
have a fractal dimension only barely above 2, while a stormy one might have a dimension closer

202
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,940
to 2.3. In fact, fractal dimension doesn't just arise frequently in nature, it seems to be the

203
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,560
core differentiator between objects that arise naturally and those that are just man-made.
