1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,360
Who doesn't like fractals?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,269
They're a beautiful blend of simplicity and complexity, 

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,600
often including these infinitely repeating patterns.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,217
Programmers in particular tend to be especially fond of them, 

5
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:17,331
because it takes a shockingly small amount of code to produce images 

6
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:20,580
that are way more intricate than any human hand ever could hope to draw.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,831
But a lot of people don't actually know the definition of a fractal, 

8
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:28,960
at least not the one Benoit Mandelbrot, the father of fractal geometry, had in mind.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,300
A common misconception is that fractals are shapes that are perfectly self-similar.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,566
For example, this snowflake-looking shape right here, called the Von Koch snowflake, 

11
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:43,117
consists of three different segments, and each one of these is perfectly self-similar, 

12
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:47,460
in that when you zoom in on it, you get a perfectly identical copy of the original.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,094
Likewise, the famous Sierpinski triangle consists 

14
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,360
of three smaller identical copies of itself.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,179
And don't get me wrong, self-similar shapes are definitely beautiful, 

16
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,780
and they're a good toy model for what fractals really are.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,520
But Mandelbrot had a much broader conception in mind, one motivated not by beauty, 

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,260
but more by a pragmatic desire to model nature in a way that actually captures roughness.

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,511
In some ways, fractal geometry is a rebellion against calculus, 

20
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:19,720
whose central assumption is that things tend to look smooth if you zoom in far enough.

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,654
But Mandelbrot saw this as overly idealized, or at least needlessly idealized, 

22
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:28,165
resulting in models that neglect the finer details of the thing 

23
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,580
they're actually modeling, which can matter.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,121
What he observed is that self-similar shapes give a basis for modeling the 

25
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:40,475
regularity in some forms of roughness, but the popular perception that fractals 

26
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,448
only include perfectly self-similar shapes is another over-idealization, 

27
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,020
one that ironically goes against the pragmatic spirit of fractal geometry's origins.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,853
The real definition of fractals has to do with this idea of fractal dimension, 

29
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,400
the main topic of this video.

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,269
You see, there is a sense, a certain way to define the word dimension, 

31
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:05,313
in which the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.585D, 

32
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:08,660
that the Von Koch curve is approximately 1.262D.

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,642
The coastline of Britain turns out to be around 1.21D, 

34
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:17,599
and in general it's possible to have shapes whose dimension is any positive real number, 

35
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,880
not just whole numbers.

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,769
I think when I first heard someone reference fractional dimension like this, 

37
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,560
I just thought it was nonsense, right?

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,120
I mean, mathematicians are clearly just making stuff up.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,780
Dimension is something that usually only makes sense for natural numbers, right?

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,898
A line is one-dimensional, a plane that's two-dimensional, 

41
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:39,860
the space that we live in that's three-dimensional, and so on.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,379
And in fact, any linear algebra student who just learned the formal definition of 

43
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,300
dimension in that context would agree, it only makes sense for counting numbers.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,520
And of course, the idea of fractal dimension is just made up.

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,640
I mean, this is math, everything's made up.

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,270
But the question is whether or not it turns out 

47
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,460
to be a useful construct for modeling the world.

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,329
And I think you'll agree, once you learn how fractal dimension is defined, 

49
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,300
it's something that you start seeing almost everywhere that you look.

50
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,912
It actually helps to start the discussion here 

51
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:13,260
by only looking at perfectly self-similar shapes.

52
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,790
In fact, I'm going to start with four shapes, 

53
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,640
the first three of which aren't even fractals.

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,720
A line, a square, a cube, and a Sierpinski triangle.

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,200
All of these shapes are self-similar.

56
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,123
A line can be broken up into two smaller lines, 

57
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,960
each of which is a perfect copy of the original, just scaled down by a half.

58
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,394
A square can be broken down into four smaller squares, 

59
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:38,340
each of which is a perfect copy of the original, just scaled down by a half.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,803
Likewise, a cube can be broken down into eight smaller cubes, 

61
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:45,200
again, each one is a scaled down version by one half.

62
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,513
And the core characteristic of the Sierpinski triangle is that it's made 

63
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:52,958
of three smaller copies of itself, and the length of the side of one of 

64
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,500
those smaller copies is one half the side length of the original triangle.

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,360
Now, it's fun to compare how we measure these things.

66
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,737
We'd say that the smaller line is one half the length of the original line, 

67
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:08,367
the smaller square is one quarter the area of the original square, 

68
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,835
the smaller cube is one eighth the volume of the original cube, 

69
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,840
and that smaller Sierpinski triangle?

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,800
Well, we'll talk about how to measure that in just a moment.

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,579
What I want is a word that generalizes the idea of length, area, 

72
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,960
and volume, but that I can apply to all of those shapes and more.

73
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,249
And typically in math, the word that you'd use for this is measure, 

74
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:32,694
but I think it might be more intuitive to talk about mass, as in, 

75
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:37,026
imagine that each of these shapes is made out of metal, a thin wire, a flat sheet, 

76
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,480
a solid cube, and some kind of Sierpinski mesh.

77
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,457
Fractal dimension has everything to do with understanding 

78
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:46,300
how the mass of these shapes changes as you scale them.

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,183
The benefit of starting the discussion with self-similar shapes 

80
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,860
is that it gives us a nice clear-cut way to compare masses.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,875
When you scale down that line by one half, the mass is also scaled down by one half, 

82
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,938
which you can viscerally see because it takes two copies of that smaller one to form the 

83
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:05,280
whole.

84
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,877
When you scale down a square by one half, its mass is scaled down by one fourth, 

85
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,849
where again you can see this by piecing together four of the smaller copies to get the 

86
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:15,260
original.

87
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,004
Likewise, when you scale down that cube by one half, 

88
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:24,985
the mass is scaled down by one eighth, or one half cubed, 

89
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:28,840
because it takes eight copies of that smaller cube to rebuild the original.

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,353
And when you scale down the Sierpinski triangle by a factor of a half, 

91
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:38,087
wouldn't you agree that it makes sense to say that its mass goes down by a factor 

92
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:38,680
of one third?

93
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,620
I mean, it takes exactly three of those smaller ones to form the original.

94
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,988
But notice that for the line, the square, and the cube, 

95
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:52,100
the factor by which the mass changed is this nice clean integer power of one half.

96
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,040
In fact, that exponent is the dimension of each shape.

97
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,408
And what's more, you could say that what it means for a shape to be, for example, 

98
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:09,318
two-dimensional, what puts the two in two-dimensional, 

99
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:15,218
is that when you scale it by some factor, its mass is scaled by that factor raised 

100
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:16,640
to the second power.

101
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,153
And maybe what it means for a shape to be three-dimensional is that when you 

102
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:27,260
scale it by some factor, the mass is scaled by the third power of that factor.

103
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,049
So if this is our conception of dimension, what 

104
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:36,760
should the dimensionality of a Sierpinski triangle be?

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,186
You'd want to say that when you scale it down by a factor of one half, 

106
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:46,120
its mass goes down by one half to the power of whatever its dimension is.

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,716
And because it's self-similar, we know that we 

108
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,840
want its mass to go down by a factor of one third.

109
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,220
So what's the number d such that raising one half to the power of d gives you one third?

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,203
Well, that's the same as asking two to the what equals three, 

111
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:05,460
the quintessential type of question that logarithms are meant to answer.

112
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,791
And when you go and plug in log base two of three to a calculator, 

113
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,180
what you'll find is that it's about 1.585.

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,587
So in this way, the Sierpinski triangle is not one-dimensional, 

115
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:20,222
even though you could define a curve that passes through all its points, 

116
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,460
and nor is it two-dimensional, even though it lives in the plane.

117
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,460
Instead, it's 1.585 dimensional.

118
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,480
And if you want to describe its mass, neither 

119
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,720
length nor area seem like the fitting notions.

120
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,862
If you tried, its length would turn out to be infinite, 

121
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,620
and its area would turn out to be zero.

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,120
Instead, what you want is whatever the 1.585 dimensional analog of length is.

123
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,120
Here, let's look at another self-similar fractal, the von Koch curve.

124
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
This one is composed of four smaller identical copies of itself, 

125
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,720
each of which is a copy of the original scaled down by one third.

126
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,720
So the scaling factor is one third, and the mass has gone down by a factor of one fourth.

127
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,941
So that means the dimension should be some number D, 

128
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:11,160
so that when we raise one third to the power of D, it gives us one fourth.

129
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,977
Well, that's the same as saying three to the what equals four, 

130
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:19,689
so you can go and plug into a calculator log base three of four, 

131
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,860
and that comes out to be around 1.262.

132
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,460
So in a sense, the von Koch curve is a 1.262 dimensional shape.

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,280
Here's another fun one.

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,500
This is kind of the right angled version of the Koch curve.

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,415
It's built up of eight scaled down copies of itself, 

136
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,720
where the scaling factor here is one fourth.

137
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,426
So if you want to know its dimension, it should be some number D, 

138
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:51,595
such that one fourth to the power of D equals one eighth, 

139
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:54,000
the factor by which the mass just decreased.

140
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,081
And in this case, the value we want is log base four of eight, 

141
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,880
and that's exactly three halves.

142
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,800
So evidently, this fractal is precisely 1.5 dimensional.

143
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,900
Does that kind of make sense?

144
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,740
It's weird, but it's all just about scaling and comparing masses while you scale.

145
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,516
And what I've described so far, everything up to this 

146
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,100
point is what you might call self-similarity dimension.

147
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,435
It does a good job making the idea of fractional dimension 

148
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:26,020
seem at least somewhat reasonable, but there's a problem.

149
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,220
It's not really a general notion.

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,028
I mean, when we were reasoning about how a mass's shape should change, 

151
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:34,360
it relied on the self-similarity of the shapes, 

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,420
that you could build them up from smaller copies of themselves.

153
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,300
But that seems unnecessarily restrictive.

154
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,980
After all, most two-dimensional shapes are not at all self-similar.

155
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,740
Consider the disk, the interior of a circle.

156
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,744
We know that's two-dimensional, and you could say that this is because 

157
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:55,653
when you scale it up by a factor of two, its mass, proportional to the area, 

158
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,700
gets scaled by the square of that factor, in this case four.

159
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,307
But it's not like there's some way to piece together four 

160
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:04,940
copies of that smaller circle to rebuild the original.

161
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,340
So how do we know that that bigger disk is exactly four times the mass of the original?

162
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,786
Answering that requires a way to make this idea of mass a little more mathematically 

163
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:20,900
rigorous, since we're not dealing with physical objects made of matter, are we?

164
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,420
We're dealing with purely geometric ones living in an abstract space.

165
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,480
And there's a couple ways to think about this, but here's a common one.

166
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,786
Cover the plane with a grid, and highlight all of the grid squares 

167
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:36,180
that are touching the disk, and now count how many there are.

168
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,152
In the back of our minds, we already know that a disk is two-dimensional, 

169
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:45,000
and the number of grid squares that it touches should be proportional to its area.

170
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,266
A clever way to verify this empirically is to scale up that disk by some factor, 

171
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:54,180
like two, and count how many grid squares touch this new scaled-up version.

172
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,211
What you should find is that that number has increased approximately in proportion to 

173
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:03,660
the square of our scaling factor, which in this case means about four times as many boxes.

174
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,313
Well, admittedly what's on the screen here might not look that convincing, 

175
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,460
but it's just because the grid is really coarse.

176
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,095
If instead you took a much finer grid, one that more tightly captures 

177
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:17,383
the intent we're going for here by measuring the size of the circle, 

178
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:20,719
that relationship of quadrupling the number of boxes touched when you 

179
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,960
scale the disk by a factor of two should shine through more clearly.

180
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,468
I'll admit though that when I was animating this, 

181
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:30,320
I was surprised by just how slowly this value converges to four.

182
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
Here's one example.

183
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,154
For larger and larger scaling values, which is actually equivalent to just 

184
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:58,760
looking at a finer grid, that data is going to more perfectly fit that parabola.

185
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,107
Now getting back to fractals, let's play this game with the Sierpinski triangle, 

186
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:09,020
counting how many boxes are touching points in that shape.

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,016
How would you imagine that number compares to scaling up the triangle 

188
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:17,140
by a factor of two and counting the new number of boxes touched?

189
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,895
Well, the proportion of boxes touched by the big one to the 

190
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:26,040
number of boxes touched by the small one should be about three.

191
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,940
After all, that bigger version is just built up of three copies of the smaller version.

192
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,910
You could also think about this as two raised to the dimension of the fractal, 

193
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,820
which we just saw is about 1.585.

194
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,099
And so if you were to go and plot the scaling factor in this case against the number of 

195
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:50,063
boxes touched by the Sierpinski triangle, the data would closely fit a curve with the 

196
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:55,200
shape of y equals x to the power 1.585, just multiplied by some proportionality constant.

197
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,810
But importantly, the whole reason that I'm talking about this is that we can play 

198
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,400
the same game with non-self-similar shapes that still have some kind of roughness.

199
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
And the classic example here is the coastline of Britain.

200
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,475
If you plop that coastline into the plane and count how many boxes are touching it, 

201
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:16,925
and then scale it by some amount, and count how many boxes are touching that new 

202
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:21,485
scaled version, what you'd find is that the number of boxes touching the coastline 

203
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:26,320
increases approximately in proportion to the scaling factor raised to the power of 1.21.

204
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,917
Here, it's kind of fun to think about how you 

205
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,060
would actually compute that number empirically.

206
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,940
As in, imagine I give you some shape, and you're a savvy programmer.

207
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,040
How would you find this number?

208
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,404
So what I'm saying here is that if you scale this shape by some factor, 

209
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:51,164
which I'll call S, the number of boxes touching that shape should equal some constant 

210
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,093
multiplied by that scaling factor raised to whatever the dimension is, 

211
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,920
the value that we're looking for.

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,291
Now, if you have some data plot that closely fits a curve that looks like the 

213
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:07,000
input raised to some power, it can be hard to see exactly what that power should be.

214
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,160
So a common trick is to take the logarithm of both sides.

215
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,769
That way, the dimension is going to drop down from the exponent, 

216
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:17,080
and we'll have a nice clean linear relationship.

217
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,385
What this suggests is that if you were to plot the log of the scaling factor 

218
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:25,875
against the log of the number of boxes touching the coastline, 

219
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:30,085
the relationship should look like a line, and that line should have a slope 

220
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,360
equal to the dimension.

221
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,300
So what that means is that if you tried out a whole bunch of scaling factors, 

222
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,467
counted the number of boxes touching the coast in each instant, 

223
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,892
and then plotted the points on the log-log plot, 

224
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:47,000
you could then do some kind of linear regression to find the best fit line to your 

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,722
data set, and when you look at the slope of that line, 

226
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,880
that tells you the empirical measurement for the dimension of what you're examining.

227
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,920
I just think that makes this idea of fractal dimension so much more 

228
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,080
real and visceral compared to abstract, artificially perfect shapes.

229
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,335
And once you're comfortable thinking about dimension like this, you, 

230
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,440
my friend, have become ready to hear the definition of a fractal.

231
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,340
Essentially, fractals are shapes whose dimension is not an integer, 

232
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,420
but instead some fractional amount.

233
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,958
What's cool about that is that it's a quantitative way to say that 

234
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,040
they're shapes that are rough, and that they stay rough even as you zoom in.

235
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,021
Technically, there's a slightly more accurate definition, 

236
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:31,502
and I've included it in the video description, 

237
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:35,250
but this idea here of a non-integer dimension almost entirely captures 

238
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,520
the idea of roughness that we're going for.

239
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,126
There is one nuance though that I haven't brought up yet, but it's worth pointing out, 

240
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:47,414
which is that this dimension, at least as I've described it so far using the box 

241
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:51,280
counting method, can sometimes change based on how far zoomed in you are.

242
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,594
For example, here's a shape sitting in three dimensions 

243
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:57,600
which at a distance looks like a line.

244
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,945
In 3D, by the way, when you do a box counting you have a 3D grid full 

245
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,480
of little cubes instead of little squares, but it works the same way.

246
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,133
At this scale, where the shape's thickness is smaller than the size of the boxes, 

247
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:16,234
it looks one-dimensional, meaning the number of boxes it touches is proportional to its 

248
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:16,640
length.

249
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,312
But when you scale it up, it starts behaving a lot more like a tube, 

250
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:25,897
touching the boxes on the surface of that tube, and so it'll look two-dimensional, 

251
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:30,760
with the number of boxes touched being proportional to the square of the scaling factor.

252
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,901
But it's not really a tube, it's made of these rapidly winding little curves, 

253
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:40,054
so once you scale it up even more, to the point where the boxes can pick up 

254
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:43,551
on the details of those curves, it looks one-dimensional again, 

255
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:48,360
with the number of boxes touched scaling directly in proportion to the scaling constant.

256
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,879
So actually assigning a number to a shape for its dimension can be tricky, 

257
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,120
and it leaves room for differing definitions and differing conventions.

258
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,258
In a pure math setting, there are indeed numerous definitions for dimension, 

259
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:10,498
but all of them focus on what the limit of this dimension is at closer and closer zoom 

260
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:10,920
levels.

261
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,247
You can think of that in terms of the plot as the limit 

262
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:20,099
of this slope as you move farther and farther to the right.

263
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,312
So for a purely geometric shape to be a genuine fractal, 

264
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:28,079
it has to continue looking rough, even as you zoom in infinitely far.

265
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,595
But in a more applied setting, like looking at the coastline of Britain, 

266
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:37,680
it doesn't really make sense to talk about the limit as you zoom in more and more.

267
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
I mean, at some point you'd just be hitting atoms.

268
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,889
Instead what you do is you look at a sufficiently wide range of scales from 

269
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:48,820
very zoomed out up to very zoomed in, and compute the dimension at each one.

270
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,961
And in this more applied setting, a shape is typically 

271
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:56,258
considered to be a fractal only when the measured dimension 

272
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,940
stays approximately constant even across multiple different scales.

273
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,940
For example, the coastline of Britain doesn't just look 1.21 dimensional at a distance.

274
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,007
Even if you zoom in by a factor of a thousand, 

275
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:10,560
the level of roughness is still around 1.21.

276
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,804
That right there is the sense in which many shapes from nature actually are self-similar, 

277
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,860
albeit not perfect self-similarity.

278
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,260
Perfectly self-similar shapes do play an important role in fractal geometry.

279
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,890
What they give us are simple to describe, low-information 

280
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,064
examples of this phenomenon of roughness, roughness that 

281
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:33,740
persists at many different scales and at arbitrarily close scales.

282
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,033
And that's important, it gives us the primitive 

283
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,980
tools for modeling these fractal phenomena.

284
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,231
But I think it's also important not to view them as the prototypical example of fractals, 

285
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:47,660
since fractals in general actually have a lot more character to them.

286
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,747
I really do think that this is one of those ideas where once you learn it, 

287
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:56,240
it makes you start looking at the world completely differently.

288
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,901
What this number is, what this fractional dimension 

289
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:02,960
gives us is a quantitative way to describe roughness.

290
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,751
For example, the coastline of Norway is about 1.52 dimensional, 

291
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:10,992
which is a numerical way to communicate the fact that it's way more jaggedy than 

292
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,040
Britain's coastline.

293
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,114
The surface of a calm ocean might have a fractal dimension only barely above 2, 

294
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,120
while a stormy one might have a dimension closer to 2.3.

295
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,703
In fact, fractal dimension doesn't just arise frequently in nature, 

296
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:29,008
it seems to be the core differentiator between objects that arise naturally and those 

297
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,160
that are just man-made.
