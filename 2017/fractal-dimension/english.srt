1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
Who doesn't like fractals? They're a beautiful blend of simplicity and complexity, often

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,280
including these infinitely repeating patterns. Programmers in particular tend to be especially

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,560
fond of them, because it takes a shockingly small amount of code to produce images that

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,360
are way more intricate than any human hand ever could hope to draw. But a lot of people

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,080
don't actually know the definition of a fractal, at least not the one Benoit Mandelbrot,

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,520
the father of fractal geometry, had in mind. A common misconception is that fractals are

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,240
shapes that are perfectly self-similar. For example, this snowflake-looking shape right

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,100
here, called the Von Koch snowflake, consists of three different segments, and each one

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,800
of these is perfectly self-similar, in that when you zoom in on it, you get a perfectly

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,960
identical copy of the original. Likewise, the famous Sierpinski triangle consists of

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,760
three smaller identical copies of itself. And don't get me wrong, self-similar shapes

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,200
are definitely beautiful, and they're a good toy model for what fractals really are. But

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,880
Mandelbrot had a much broader conception in mind, one motivated not by beauty, but more

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,640
by a pragmatic desire to model nature in a way that actually captures roughness. In some

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,340
ways, fractal geometry is a rebellion against calculus, whose central assumption is that

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,000
things tend to look smooth if you zoom in far enough. But Mandelbrot saw this as overly

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,200
idealized, or at least needlessly idealized, resulting in models that neglect the finer

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,000
details of the thing they're actually modeling, which can matter. What he observed is that

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,360
self-similar shapes give a basis for modeling the regularity in some forms of roughness,

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,020
but the popular perception that fractals only include perfectly self-similar shapes is another

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,520
over-idealization, one that ironically goes against the pragmatic spirit of fractal geometry's

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,140
origins. The real definition of fractals has to do with this idea of fractal dimension,

23
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,160
the main topic of this video. You see, there is a sense, a certain way to define the word

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,920
dimension in which the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.585D, that the Von Koch

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,640
curve is approximately 1.262D. The coastline of Britain turns out to be around 1.21D, and

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,020
in general it's possible to have shapes whose dimension is any positive real number, not

27
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,340
just whole numbers.

28
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,540
I think when I first heard someone reference fractional dimension like this, I just thought

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,800
it was nonsense, right? I mean, mathematicians are clearly just making stuff up. Dimension

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,260
is something that usually only makes sense for natural numbers, right? A line is one

31
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,380
dimensional, a plane is two dimensional, the space we live in is three dimensional, and

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,220
so on. And in fact, any linear algebra student who just learned the formal definition of

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,500
fraction in that context would agree, it only makes sense for counting numbers. And

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,260
of course, the idea of fractal dimension is just made up. I mean, this is math, everything's

35
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,580
made up. But the question is whether or not it turns out to be a useful construct for

36
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,820
modeling the world. And I think you'll agree, once you learn how fractal dimension is defined,

37
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,120
it's something that you start seeing almost everywhere that you look.

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,060
It actually helps to start the discussion here by only looking at perfectly self-similar

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,920
shapes. In fact, I'm going to start with four shapes, the first three of which aren't

40
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,540
even fractals. A line, a square, a cube, and a Sierpinski triangle. All of these shapes

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,820
are self-similar. A line can be broken up into two smaller lines, each of which is a

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,900
perfect copy of the original, just scaled down by a half. A square can be broken down

43
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,520
into four smaller squares, each of which is a perfect copy of the original, just scaled

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,360
down by a half. Likewise, a cube can be broken down into eight smaller cubes, again, each

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,120
one is a scaled down version by one half. And the core characteristic of the Sierpinski

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,920
triangle is that it's made of three smaller copies of itself, and the length of the side

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,360
of one of those smaller copies is one half the side length of the original triangle.

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,000
Now it's fun to compare how we measure these things. We'd say that the smaller line is

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,840
one half the length of the original line, the smaller square is one quarter the area

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,540
of the original square, the smaller cube is one eighth the volume of the original cube,

51
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,180
and that smaller Sierpinski triangle, well, we'll talk about how to measure that in

52
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,840
just a moment. What I want is a word that generalizes the idea of length, area, and

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,760
volume, but that I can apply to all of those shapes, and more. And typically in math, the

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,740
word you'd use for this is measure, but I think it might be more intuitive to talk

55
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,120
about mass, as in, imagine that each of these shapes is made out of metal, a thin wire,

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,720
a flat sheet, a solid cube, and some kind of Sierpinski mesh.

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,600
Fractal dimension has everything to do with understanding how the mass of these shapes

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,500
changes as you scale them. The benefit of starting the discussion with self-similar

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,740
shapes is that it gives us a nice, clear-cut way to compare masses. When you scale down

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,020
that line by one half, the mass is also scaled down by one half, which you can viscerally

61
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,920
see because it takes two copies of that smaller one to form the whole. When you scale down

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,360
a square by one half, its mass is scaled down by one fourth, where again you can see this

63
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,360
by piecing together four of the smaller copies to get the original. Likewise, when you scale

64
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,840
down that cube by one half, the mass is scaled down by one eighth, or one half cubed, because

65
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,940
it takes eight copies of that smaller cube to rebuild the original. And when you scale

66
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,900
down the Sierpinski triangle by a factor of a half, wouldn't you agree that it makes sense

67
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,740
to say that its mass goes down by a factor of one third? I mean, it takes exactly three

68
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,940
of those smaller ones to form the original. But notice that for the line, the square,

69
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,300
and the cube, the factor by which the mass changed is this nice, clean integer power

70
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:58,320
of one half. In fact, that exponent is the dimension of each shape. And what's more,

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,520
you could say that what it means for a shape to be, for example, two dimensional, what

72
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,520
puts the two in two dimensional, is that when you scale it by some factor, its mass is scaled

73
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,800
by that factor raised to the second power. And maybe what it means for a shape to be

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,600
three dimensional, is that when you scale it by some factor, the mass is scaled by the

75
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,600
third power of that factor. So if this is our conception of dimension, what should the

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,820
dimensionality of a Sierpinski triangle be? You'd want to say that when you scale it

77
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,200
down by a factor of one half, its mass goes down by one half to the power of, well, whatever

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,820
its dimension is. And because it's self-similar, we know that we want its mass to go down by

79
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:56,180
a factor of one third. So what's the number d such that raising one half to the power

80
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,700
of d gives you one third? Well, that's the same as asking two to the what equals three,

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,080
the quintessential type of question that logarithms are meant to answer. And when you go and plug

82
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,460
in log base two of three to a calculator, what you'll find is that it's about 1.585.

83
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,780
So in this way, the Sierpinski triangle is not one dimensional, even though you could

84
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,460
define a curve that passes through all its points, and nor is it two dimensional, even

85
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,100
though it lives in the plane. Instead, it's 1.585 dimensional. And if you want to describe

86
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,640
its mass, neither length nor area seem like the fitting notions. If you tried, its length

87
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,500
would turn out to be infinite, and its area would turn out to be zero. Instead, what you

88
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,500
want is whatever the 1.585 dimensional analog of length is. Here, let's look at another

89
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,300
self-similar fractal, the von Koch curve. This one is composed of four smaller identical

90
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,760
copies of itself, each of which is a copy of the original, scaled down by one third.

91
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,220
So the scaling factor is one third, and the mass has gone down by a factor of one fourth.

92
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,700
So that means the dimension should be some number d, so that when we raise one third

93
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,100
to the power of d, it gives us one fourth. Well, that's the same as saying three to

94
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,460
the what equals four, so you can go and plug into a calculator log base three of four,

95
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:26,460
and that comes out to be around 1.262. So in a sense, the von Koch curve is a 1.262

96
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,780
dimensional shape. Here's another fun one. This is kind of the right angled version of

97
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:39,780
the Koch curve. It's built up of eight scaled down copies of itself, where the scaling factor

98
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:47,780
here is one fourth. So if you want to know its dimension, it should be some number d,

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,540
such that one fourth to the power of d equals one eighth, the factor by which the mass just

100
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,540
decreased. And in this case, the value we want is log base four of eight, and that's

101
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,680
exactly three halves. So evidently, this fractal is precisely 1.5 dimensional. Does that kind

102
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,660
of make sense? It's weird, but it's all just about scaling and comparing masses while you

103
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:20,080
scale. And what I've described so far, everything up to this point, is what you might call self-similarity

104
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,440
dimension. It does a good job making the idea of fractional dimensions seem at least somewhat

105
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,280
reasonable, but there's a problem. It's not really a general notion. I mean, when we were

106
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,000
reasoning about how a mass's shape should change, it relied on the self-similarity of

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,360
the shapes, that you could build them up from smaller copies of themselves. But that

108
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,320
seems unnecessarily restrictive. After all, most two-dimensional shapes are not at all

109
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,840
self-similar. Consider the disc, the interior of a circle. We know that's two-dimensional,

110
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,160
and you could say that this is because when you scale it up by a factor of two, its mass,

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,640
proportional to the area, gets scaled by the square of that factor, in this case four.

112
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,760
But it's not like there's some way to piece together four copies of that smaller circle

113
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,240
to rebuild the original. So how do we know that the bigger disc is exactly four times

114
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,520
the mass of the original?

115
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,880
Answering that requires a way to make this idea of mass a little more mathematically

116
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,400
rigorous, since we're not dealing with physical objects made of matter, are we? We're dealing

117
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,480
with purely geometric ones living in an abstract space.

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,680
And there's a couple ways to think about this, but here's a common one. Cover the plane

119
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,680
with a grid, and highlight all of the grid squares that are touching the disc, and now

120
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,720
count how many there are.

121
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,880
In the back of our minds, we already know that a disc is two-dimensional, and the number

122
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,560
of grid squares that it touches should be proportional to its area. A clever way to

123
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,700
verify this empirically is to scale up that disc by some factor, like two, and count how

124
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,080
many grid squares touch this new scaled-up version. What you should find is that that

125
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,240
number has increased approximately in proportion to the square of our scaling factor, which

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,400
in this case means about four times as many boxes.

127
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,040
Well, admittedly what's on the screen here might not look that convincing, but it's just

128
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,240
because the grid is really coarse. If instead you took a much finer grid, one that more

129
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,560
tightly captures the intent we're going for here by measuring the size of the circle,

130
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,240
that relationship of quadrupling the number of boxes touched when you scale the disc by

131
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,480
a factor of two should shine through more clearly.

132
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,040
I'll admit though that when I was animating this I was surprised by just how slowly this

133
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
value converges to four.

134
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,520
Here's one way to think about this. If you were to plot the scaling factor compared to

135
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,320
the number of boxes that the scaled disc touches, your data should very closely fit a perfect

136
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,480
parabola, since the number of boxes touched is roughly proportional to the square of the

137
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,000
scaling factor.

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,740
For larger and larger scaling values, which is actually equivalent to just looking at

139
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:02,500
a finer grid, that data is going to more perfectly fit that parabola.

140
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Now getting back to fractals, let's play this game with the Sierpinski triangle, counting

141
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,620
how many boxes are touching points in that shape.

142
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,260
How would you imagine that number compares to scaling up the triangle by a factor of

143
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,100
two and counting the new number of boxes touched?

144
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,880
Well the proportion of boxes touched by the big one to the number of boxes touched by

145
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,740
the small one should be about three. After all, that bigger version is just built up

146
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,760
of three copies of the smaller version.

147
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,900
You could also think of this as two raised to the dimension of the fractal, which we

148
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,140
just saw is about 1.585.

149
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,420
And so if you were to go and plot the scaling factor in this case against the number of

150
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,180
boxes touched by the Sierpinski triangle, the data would closely fit a curve with the

151
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:57,260
shape of y equals x to the power 1.585, just multiplied by some proportionality constant.

152
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,080
But importantly, the whole reason I'm talking about this is that we can play the same game

153
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,920
with non-self-similar shapes that still have some kind of roughness.

154
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,000
The classic example here is the coastline of Britain.

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
If you plop that coastline into the plane and count how many boxes are touching it,

156
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
and then scale it by some amount, and count how many boxes are touching that new scaled

157
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,140
version, what you'd find is that the number of boxes touching the coastline increases

158
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,980
approximately in proportion to the scaling factor raised to the power of 1.21.

159
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,620
Here, it's kind of fun to think about how you would actually compute that number empirically.

160
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,020
As in, imagine I give you some shape, and you're a savvy programmer, how would you

161
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,740
find this number?

162
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,960
So what I'm saying here is that if you scale this shape by some factor, which I'll

163
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,300
call S, the number of boxes touching that shape should equal some constant multiplied

164
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,560
by that scaling factor raised to whatever the dimension is, the value we're looking

165
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
for.

166
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,480
Now, if you have some data plot that closely fits a curve that looks like the input raised

167
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,180
to some power, it can be hard to see exactly what that power should be.

168
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,060
So a common trick is to take the logarithm of both sides.

169
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,920
That way, the dimension will drop down from the exponent and we'll have a nice clean

170
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
linear relationship.

171
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,640
What this suggests is that if you were to plot the log of the scaling factor against

172
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,980
the log of the number of boxes touching the coastline, the relationship should look like

173
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,460
a line, and that line should have a slope equal to the dimension.

174
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,420
So what that means is that if you tried out a whole bunch of scaling factors, counted

175
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,160
the number of boxes touching the coast in each instant, and then plotted the points

176
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,180
on the log-log plot, you could then do some kind of linear regression to find the best

177
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,880
fit line to your dataset, and when you look at the slope of that line, that tells you

178
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,680
the empirical measurement for the dimension of what you're examining.

179
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,880
I just think that makes this idea of fractal dimension so much more real and visceral compared

180
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,200
to abstract, artificially perfect shapes.

181
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,820
And once you're comfortable thinking about dimension like this, you, my friend, have

182
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,880
become ready to hear the definition of a fractal.

183
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,160
Essentially, fractals are shapes whose dimension is not an integer, but instead some fractional

184
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
amount.

185
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,320
What's cool about that is that it's a quantitative way to say that they're shapes

186
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,880
that are rough, and that they stay rough even as you zoom in.

187
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,600
Technically there's a slightly more accurate definition, and I've included it in the

188
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,360
video description, but this idea here of a non-integer dimension almost entirely captures

189
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,720
the idea of roughness that we're going for.

190
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,400
There is one nuance though that I haven't brought up yet but it's worth pointing out,

191
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,720
which is that this dimension, at least as I've described it so far using the box-counting

192
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,000
method, can sometimes change based on how far zoomed in you are.

193
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,040
For example, here's a shape sitting in three dimensions, which at a distance looks like

194
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,360
a line.

195
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,140
In 3D, by the way, when you do a box-counting, you have a 3D grid full of little cubes instead

196
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,440
of little squares, but it works the same way.

197
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,160
At this scale, where the shape's thickness is smaller than the size of the boxes, it

198
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,320
looks one-dimensional, meaning the number of boxes it touches is proportional to its

199
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,740
length.

200
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,160
But when you scale it up, it starts behaving a lot more like a tube, touching the boxes

201
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,320
on the surface of that tube, and so it'll look two-dimensional, with the number of boxes

202
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,880
touched being proportional to the square of the scaling factor.

203
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,640
But it's not really a tube, it's made of these rapidly winding little curves, so once

204
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,000
you scale it up even more, to the point where the boxes can pick up on the details of those

205
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,400
curves, it looks one-dimensional again, with the number of boxes touched scaling directly

206
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,600
in proportion to the scaling constant.

207
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,280
So actually assigning a number to a shape for its dimension can be tricky, and it leaves

208
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,160
room for differing definitions and differing conventions.

209
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,800
In a pure math setting, there are indeed numerous definitions for dimension, but all

210
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:14,800
of them focus on what the limit of this dimension is at closer and closer zoom levels.

211
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,040
You can think of that in terms of the plot as the limit of this slope as you move farther

212
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,260
and farther to the right.

213
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,000
So for a purely geometric shape to be a genuine fractal, it has to continue looking rough,

214
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
even as you zoom in infinitely far.

215
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,740
But in a more applied setting, like looking at the coastline of Britain, it doesn't really

216
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,980
make sense to talk about the limit as you zoom in more and more, I mean at some point

217
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,200
you'd just be hitting atoms.

218
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,640
Instead what you do is look at a sufficiently wide range of scales, from very zoomed out

219
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,080
up to very zoomed in, and compute the dimension at each one.

220
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,640
And in this more applied setting, a shape is typically considered to be a fractal only

221
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,680
when the measured dimension stays approximately constant even across multiple different scales.

222
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,520
For example, the coastline of Britain doesn't just look 1.21 dimensional at a distance,

223
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,760
even if you zoom in by a factor of 1000, the level of roughness is still around 1.21.

224
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,600
That right there is the sense in which many shapes from nature actually are self-similar,

225
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,100
albeit not perfect self-similarity.

226
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,980
Perfectly self-similar shapes do play an important role in fractal geometry.

227
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,700
What they give us are simple to describe, low-information examples of this phenomenon

228
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,500
of roughness, roughness that persists at many different scales, and at arbitrarily close

229
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
scales.

230
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,820
And that's important, it gives us the primitive tools for modeling these fractal phenomena.

231
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,300
But I think it's also important not to view them as the prototypical example of fractals,

232
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,760
since fractals in general actually have a lot more character to them.

233
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,580
I really do think this is one of those ideas where once you learn it, it makes you start

234
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,000
looking at the world completely differently.

235
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,420
What this number is, what this fractional dimension gives us, is a quantitative way

236
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,400
to describe roughness.

237
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,480
For example, the coastline of Norway is about 1.52 dimensional, which is a numerical way

238
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,920
to communicate the fact that it's way more jaggedy than Britain's coastline.

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,860
The surface of a calm ocean might have a fractal dimension only barely above 2, while a stormy

240
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,380
one might have a dimension closer to 2.3.

241
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,140
In fact, fractal dimension doesn't just arise frequently in nature, it seems to be the core

242
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,140
differentiator between objects that arise naturally and those that are just man-made.

243
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,940
