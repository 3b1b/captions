1
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:19,140
The goal here is simple, explain what a derivative is.

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,460
The thing is though, there's some subtlety to this topic, and a lot of potential for

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,820
paradoxes if you're not careful.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,920
So a secondary goal is that you have an appreciation for what those paradoxes are and how to avoid

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
them.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,360
You see, it's common for people to say that the derivative measures an instantaneous rate

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,540
of change, but when you think about it, that phrase is actually an oxymoron.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,760
Change is something that happens between separate points in time, and when you blind yourself

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,000
to all but just a single instant, there's not really any room for change.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,180
You'll see what I mean more as we get into it, but when you appreciate that a phrase

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,620
like instantaneous rate of change is actually nonsense, I think it makes you appreciate

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,260
just how clever the fathers of calculus were in capturing the idea that phrase is meant

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,620
to evoke, but with a perfectly sensible piece of math, the derivative.

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,100
As our central example, I want you to imagine a car that starts at some point A, speeds

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,140
up, and then slows down to a stop at some point B 100 meters away, and let's say it

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,140
all happens over the course of 10 seconds.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,660
That's the setup to have in mind as we lay out what the derivative is.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,620
We could graph this motion, letting the vertical axis represent the distance traveled, and

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,620
the horizontal axis represent time.

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,580
So at each time t, represented with a point somewhere on the horizontal axis, the height

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,860
of the graph tells us how far the car has traveled in total after that amount of time.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,780
It's pretty common to name a distance function like this s of t.

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,780
I would use the letter d for distance, but that guy already has another full time job

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,500
in calculus.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,460
Initially this curve is quite shallow, since the car is slow to start.

26
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,260
During that first second, the distance it travels doesn't change that much.

27
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,340
Then for the next few seconds, as the car speeds up, the distance traveled in a given

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,120
second gets larger, which corresponds to a steeper slope in this graph.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,200
And then towards the end when it slows down, that curve shallows out again.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,120
And if we were to plot the car's velocity in meters per second as a function of time,

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
it might look like this bump.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
At early times the velocity is very small.

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,000
Up to the middle of the journey, the car builds up to some maximum velocity, covering a relatively

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,960
large distance each second.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,860
Then it slows back down towards a speed of zero.

36
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,960
These two curves are definitely related to each other.

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,940
If you change the specific distance vs time function, you'll have some different velocity

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,820
vs time function.

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,100
What we want to understand is the specifics of that relationship.

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,940
Exactly how does velocity depend on a distance vs time function?

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,460
To do that, it's worth taking a moment to think critically about what exactly velocity

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,100
means here.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,780
Intuitively, we all might know what velocity at a given moment means.

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,820
It's just whatever the car's speedometer shows in that moment.

45
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,980
And intuitively, it might make sense that the car's velocity should be higher at times

46
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,700
when this distance function is steeper, when the car traverses more distance per unit time.

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,500
But the funny thing is, velocity at a single moment makes no sense.

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,340
If I show you a picture of a car, just a snapshot in an instant, and I ask you how fast it's

49
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,800
going, you'd have no way of telling me.

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
What you'd need are two separate points in time to compare.

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,640
That way you can compute whatever the change in distance across those times is, divided

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,200
by the change in time.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Right?

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,800
I mean, that's what velocity is, it's the distance traveled per unit time.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,260
So how is it that we're looking at a function for velocity that only takes in a single value

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,320
of t, a single snapshot in time?

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,600
It's weird, isn't it?

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,080
We want to associate individual points in time with a velocity, but actually computing

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,080
velocity requires comparing two separate points in time.

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,040
If that feels strange and paradoxical, good!

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,640
You're grappling with the same conflicts that the fathers of calculus did.

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,680
And if you want a deep understanding for rates of change, not just for a moving car, but

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,840
for all sorts of things in science, you're going to need to resolve this apparent paradox.

64
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,000
First, I think it's best to talk about the real world, and then we'll go into a purely

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
mathematical one.

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,320
Let's think about what the car's speedometer is probably doing.

67
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,720
At some point, say 3 seconds into the journey, the speedometer might measure how far the

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,000
car goes in a very small amount of time, maybe the distance traveled between 3 seconds and

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,640
3.01 seconds.

70
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,840
Then it could compute the speed in meters per second as that tiny distance traversed

71
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,920
in meters divided by that tiny time, 0.01 seconds.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,080
That is, a physical car just side-steps the paradox and doesn't actually compute speed

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,240
at a single point in time, it computes speed during a very small amount of time.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,080
So let's call that difference in time dt, which you might think of as 0.01 seconds,

75
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,500
and let's call that resulting difference in distance ds.

76
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,800
So the velocity at some point in time is ds divided by dt, the tiny change in distance

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,200
over the tiny change in time.

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,280
Graphically, you can imagine zooming in on some point of this distance vs. time graph

79
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,640
above t equals 3.

80
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,800
That dt is a small step to the right, since time is on the horizontal axis, and that ds

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,440
is the resulting change in the height of the graph, since the vertical axis represents

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
the distance traveled.

83
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,440
So ds divided by dt is something you can think of as the rise over run slope between two

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,680
very close points on this graph.

85
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,960
Of course, there's nothing special about the value t equals 3.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,280
We could apply this to any other point in time, so we consider this expression ds over

87
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,880
dt to be a function of t, something where I can give you a time t and you can give me

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,120
back the value of this ratio at that time, the velocity as a function of time.

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,760
For example, when I had the computer draw this bump curve here, the one representing

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,200
the velocity function, here's what I had the computer actually do.

91
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,600
First I chose a small value for dt, I think in this case it was 0.01.

92
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,920
Then I had the computer look at a whole bunch of times t between 0 and 10 and compute the

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,640
distance function s at t plus dt, and then subtract off the value of that function at

94
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
t.

95
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,880
In other words, that's the difference in the distance traveled between the given time

96
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,640
t and the time 0.01 seconds after that.

97
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,060
Then you can just divide that difference by the change in time, dt, and that gives you

98
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,780
velocity in meters per second around each point in time.

99
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,780
With a formula like this, you could give the computer any curve representing any distance

100
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,300
function s of t, and it could figure out the curve representing velocity.

101
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,200
Now would be a good time to pause, reflect, and make sure this idea of relating distance

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,360
to velocity by looking at tiny changes makes sense, because we're going to tackle the

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,740
paradox of the derivative head on.

104
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,500
This idea of ds over dt, a tiny change in the value of the function s, divided by the

105
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,940
tiny change in the input that caused it, that's almost what a derivative is.

106
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,980
And even though a car's speedometer will actually look at a concrete change in time,

107
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,840
like 0.01 seconds, and even though the drawing program here is looking at an actual concrete

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,780
change in time, in pure math the derivative is not this ratio ds over dt for a specific

109
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,100
choice of dt.

110
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,020
Instead, it's whatever that ratio approaches as your choice for dt approaches 0.

111
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:08,300
Luckily, there's a nice visual understanding for what it means to ask what this ratio approaches.

112
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,540
Remember, for any specific choice of dt, this ratio ds over dt is the slope of a line passing

113
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,500
through two separate points on the graph, right?

114
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,940
Well, as dt approaches 0, and as those two points approach each other, the slope of the

115
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,380
line approaches the slope of a line that's tangent to the graph at whatever point t we're

116
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,620
looking at.

117
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,620
So the true, honest-to-goodness pure math derivative is not the rise-over-run slope

118
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,680
between two nearby points on the graph, it's equal to the slope of a line tangent to the

119
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,300
graph at a single point.

120
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,980
Now notice what I'm not saying.

121
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm not saying that the derivative is whatever happens when dt is infinitely small, whatever

122
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
that would mean.

123
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,120
Nor am I saying that you plug in 0 for dt.

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,560
This dt is always a finitely small non-zero value, it's just that it approaches 0 is

125
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,960
all.

126
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,560
I think that's really clever.

127
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,840
Even though change in an instant makes no sense, this idea of letting dt approach 0

128
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,900
is a really sneaky backdoor way to talk reasonably about the rate of change at a single point

129
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
in time.

130
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Isn't that neat?

131
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,840
It's kind of flirting with the paradox of change in an instant without ever needing

132
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,160
to touch it, and it comes with a nice visual intuition too, as the slope of a tangent line

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,140
to a single point on the graph.

134
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,840
And because change in an instant still makes no sense, I think it's healthiest for you

135
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,640
to think of this slope not as some instantaneous rate of change, but instead as the best constant

136
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,400
approximation for a rate of change around a point.

137
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
By the way, it's worth saying a couple words on notation here.

138
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Throughout this video I've been using dt to refer to a tiny change in t with some actual

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,440
size, and ds to refer to the resulting change in s, which again has an actual size, and

140
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,760
this is because that's how I want you to think about them.

141
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
But the convention in calculus is that whenever you're using the letter d like this, you're

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,880
kind of announcing your intention that eventually you're going to see what happens as dt approaches

143
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,000
0.

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,240
For example, the honest-to-goodness pure math derivative is written as ds divided by dt,

145
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,960
even though it's technically not a fraction per se, but whatever that fraction approaches

146
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
for smaller and smaller nudges in t.

147
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,280
I think a specific example should help here.

148
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,560
You might think that asking about what this ratio approaches for smaller and smaller values

149
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,320
would make it much more difficult to compute, but weirdly it kind of makes things easier.

150
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,520
Let's say you have a given distance vs time function that happens to be exactly t cubed,

151
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,440
so after 1 second the car has traveled 1 cubed equals 1 meter, after 2 seconds it's traveled

152
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
2 cubed, or 8 meters, and so on.

153
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,220
Now what I'm about to do might seem somewhat complicated, but once the dust settles it

154
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,760
really is simpler, and more importantly it's the kind of thing you only ever have to do

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,280
once in calculus.

156
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Let's say you wanted to compute the velocity, ds divided by dt, at some specific time, like

157
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,160
t equals 2.

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,720
And for right now let's think of dt as having an actual size, some concrete nudge, we'll

159
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,160
let it go to 0 in just a bit.

160
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,840
The tiny change in distance between 2 seconds and 2 plus dt seconds is s of 2 plus dt minus

161
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,840
s of 2, and we divide that by dt.

162
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,440
Notice our function is t cubed, that numerator looks like 2 plus dt cubed minus 2 cubed.

163
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,880
And this is something we can work out algebraically.

164
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,840
Again bear with me, there's a reason I'm showing you the details here.

165
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:50,960
When you expand that top, what you get is 2 cubed plus 3 times 2 squared dt plus 3 times

166
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,400
2 times dt squared plus dt cubed, and all of that is minus 2 cubed.

167
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,040
Now there's a lot of terms, and I want you to remember that it looks like a mess,

168
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,980
but it does simplify.

169
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,780
Those 2 cubed terms cancel out.

170
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,520
And then everything remaining here has a dt in it, and since there's a dt on the bottom

171
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,320
there, many of those cancel out as well.

172
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,040
What this means is that the ratio ds divided by dt has boiled down into 3 times 2 squared

173
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,640
plus 2 different terms that each have a dt in them.

174
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,860
So if we ask what happens as dt approaches 0, representing the idea of looking at a smaller

175
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,280
and smaller change in time, we can just completely ignore those other terms.

176
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,040
By eliminating the need to think about a specific dt, we've eliminated a lot of the complication

177
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
in the full expression.

178
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,580
So what we're left with is this nice clean 3 times 2 squared.

179
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,380
You can think of that as meaning that the slope of a line tangent to the point at t

180
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,420
equals 2 of this graph is exactly 3 times 2 squared, or 12.

181
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,620
And of course, there's nothing special about the time t equals 2.

182
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,540
We could more generally say that the derivative of t cubed as a function of t is 3 times t

183
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,260
squared.

184
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,900
Now take a step back, because that's beautiful.

185
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,420
The derivative is this crazy complicated idea.

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,780
We've got tiny changes in distance over tiny changes in time, but instead of looking

187
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,100
at any specific one of those, we're talking about what that thing approaches.

188
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,720
I mean, that's a lot to think about.

189
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,100
And yet what we've come out with is such a simple expression, 3 times t squared.

190
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,480
And in practice, you wouldn't go through all this algebra each time.

191
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,320
Knowing that the derivative of t cubed is 3t squared is one of those things that all

192
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,160
calculus students learn how to do immediately without having to re-derive it each time.

193
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,320
And in the next video, I'm going to show you a nice way to think about this and a couple

194
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,960
other derivative formulas in really nice geometric ways.

195
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,640
But the point I want to make by showing you all of the algebraic guts here is that when

196
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,720
you consider the tiny change in distance caused by a tiny change in time for some specific

197
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,380
value of dt, you'd have kind of a mess.

198
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,520
But when you consider what that ratio approaches as dt approaches 0, it lets you ignore much

199
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,880
of that mess, and it really does simplify the problem.

200
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,600
That right there is kind of the heart of why calculus becomes useful.

201
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,840
Another reason to show you a concrete derivative like this is that it sets the stage, for example,

202
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,920
of the kind of paradoxes that come about if you believe too much in the illusion of instantaneous

203
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,000
rate of change.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,120
So think about the actual car traveling according to this t cubed distance function, and consider

205
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,740
its motion at the moment t equals 0, right at the start.

206
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:46,020
Now ask yourself whether or not the car is moving at that time.

207
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,100
On the one hand, we can compute its speed at that point using the derivative, 3t squared,

208
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,380
which for time t equals 0 works out to be 0.

209
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,860
Visually, this means that the tangent line to the graph at that point is perfectly flat,

210
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,540
so the car's quote-unquote instantaneous velocity is 0, and that suggests that obviously

211
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,220
it's not moving.

212
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,420
But on the other hand, if it doesn't start moving at time 0, when does it start moving?

213
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,180
Really, pause and ponder that for a moment.

214
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,540
Is the car moving at time t equals 0?

215
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,300
Do you see the paradox?

216
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,260
The issue is that the question makes no sense.

217
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,580
It references the idea of change in a moment, but that doesn't actually exist.

218
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,580
That's just not what the derivative measures.

219
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,420
What it means for the derivative of a distance function to be 0 is that the best constant

220
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,160
approximation for the car's velocity around that point is 0 m per second.

221
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,180
For example, if you look at an actual change in time, say between time 0 and 0.1 seconds,

222
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,600
the car does move.

223
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,860
It moves 0.001 meters.

224
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,580
That's very small, and importantly it's very small compared to the change in time,

225
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,180
giving an average speed of only 0.01 m per second.

226
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,080
And remember, what it means for the derivative of this motion to be 0 is that for smaller

227
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,940
and smaller nudges in time, this ratio of m per second approaches 0.

228
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,940
But that's not to say that the car is static.

229
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,420
Approximating its movement with a constant velocity of 0 is, after all, just an approximation.

230
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,180
So whenever you hear people refer to the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, a phrase

231
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,100
which is intrinsically oxymoronic, I want you to think of that as a conceptual shorthand

232
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,220
for the best constant approximation for rate of change.

233
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,580
In the next couple videos I'll be talking more about the derivative, what it looks like

234
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,320
in different contexts, how do you actually compute it, why is it useful, things like

235
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,940
that, focusing on visual intuition as always.
