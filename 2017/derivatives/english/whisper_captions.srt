1
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,960
The goal here is simple, explain what a derivative is.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,560
The thing is though, there's some subtlety to this topic, and a lot of potential for

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,200
paradoxes if you're not careful.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,940
So a secondary goal is that you have an appreciation for what those paradoxes are and how to avoid

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,220
them.

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,380
You see, it's common for people to say that the derivative measures an instantaneous rate

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,760
of change, but when you think about it, that phrase is actually an oxymoron.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,700
Change is something that happens between separate points in time, and when you blind yourself

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,600
to all but just a single instant, there's not really any room for change.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,200
You'll see what I mean more as we get into it, but when you appreciate that a phrase

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,560
like instantaneous rate of change is actually nonsense, I think it makes you appreciate

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,200
just how clever the fathers of calculus were in capturing the idea that phrase is meant

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,980
to evoke, but with a perfectly sensible piece of math, the derivative.

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,040
As our central example, I want you to imagine a car that starts at some point A, speeds

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,160
up, and then slows down to a stop at some point B 100 meters away, and let's say it

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,000
all happens over the course of 10 seconds.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,900
That's the setup to have in mind as we lay out what the derivative is.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,100
Well, we could graph this motion, letting the vertical axis represent the distance traveled,

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:38,380
and the horizontal axis represent time, so at each time t, represented with a point somewhere

20
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,580
on the horizontal axis, the height of the graph tells us how far the car has traveled

21
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,540
in total after that amount of time.

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,160
It's pretty common to name a distance function like this s of t.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,800
I would use the letter d for distance, but that guy already has another full time job

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,360
in calculus.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,760
Initially, the curve is quite shallow, since the car is slow to start.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,340
During that first second, the distance it travels doesn't change that much.

27
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,720
For the next few seconds, as the car speeds up, the distance traveled in a given second

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,220
gets larger, which corresponds to a steeper slope in this graph.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,520
Then towards the end, when it slows down, that curve shallows out again.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,140
If we were to plot the car's velocity in meters per second as a function of time, it

31
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,200
might look like this bump.

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,000
At early times, the velocity is very small.

33
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,960
Up to the middle of the journey, the car builds up to some maximum velocity, covering a relatively

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,620
large distance each second.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,920
Then it slows back down towards a speed of zero.

36
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,180
These two curves are definitely related to each other.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,000
If you change the specific distance vs. time function, you'll have some different velocity

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,080
vs. time function.

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
What we want to understand is the specifics of that relationship.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,820
Exactly how does velocity depend on a distance vs. time function?

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,480
To do that, it's worth taking a moment to think critically about what exactly velocity

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,540
means here.

43
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,420
Intuitively, we all might know what velocity at a given moment means, it's just whatever

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,980
the car's speedometer shows in that moment.

45
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,040
Intuitively, it might make sense that the car's velocity should be higher at times

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,640
when this distance function is steeper, when the car traverses more distance per unit time.

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,720
But the funny thing is, velocity at a single moment makes no sense.

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,320
If I show you a picture of a car, just a snapshot in an instant, and I ask you how fast it's

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,540
going, you'd have no way of telling me.

50
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,380
What you'd need are two separate points in time to compare.

51
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,620
That way you can compute whatever the change in distance across those times is, divided

52
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,860
by the change in time.

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,740
Right?

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,160
I mean, that's what velocity is, it's the distance traveled per unit time.

55
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,280
So how is it that we're looking at a function for velocity that only takes in a single value

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,360
of t, a single snapshot in time?

57
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,280
It's weird, isn't it?

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,040
We want to associate individual points in time with a velocity, but actually computing

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,300
velocity requires comparing two separate points in time.

60
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,400
If that feels strange and paradoxical, good!

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,960
You're grappling with the same conflicts that the fathers of calculus did.

62
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,680
And if you want a deep understanding for rates of change, not just for a moving car, but

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,720
for all sorts of things in science, you're going to need to resolve this apparent paradox.

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,760
First, I think it's best to talk about the real world, and then we'll go into a

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,940
purely mathematical one.

66
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,460
Let's think about what the car's speedometer is probably doing.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,780
At some point, say 3 seconds into the journey, the speedometer might measure how far the

68
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,920
car goes in a very small amount of time, maybe the distance traveled between 3 seconds and

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,420
3.01 seconds.

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,800
Then it could compute the speed in meters per second as that tiny distance traversed

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,860
in meters divided by that tiny time, 0.01 seconds.

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,060
That is, a physical car just side-steps the paradox and doesn't actually compute speed

73
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,260
at a single point in time.

74
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,680
It computes speed during a very small amount of time.

75
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,620
So let's call that difference in time dt, which you might think of as 0.01 seconds,

76
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,360
and let's call that resulting difference in distance ds.

77
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,820
So the velocity at some point in time is ds divided by dt, the tiny change in distance

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,400
over the tiny change in time.

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,020
Graphically, you can imagine zooming in on some point of this distance vs. time graph

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,680
above t equals 3.

81
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,620
That dt is a small step to the right, since time is on the horizontal axis, and that ds

82
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,400
is the resulting change in the height of the graph, since the vertical axis represents

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,440
the distance traveled.

84
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,360
So ds divided by dt is something you can think of as the rise over run slope between two

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
very close points on this graph.

86
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,440
Of course, there's nothing special about the value t equals 3.

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,360
We could apply this to any other point in time, so we consider this expression ds over

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,980
dt to be a function of t, something where I can give you a time t and you can give me

89
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,880
back the value of this ratio at that time, the velocity as a function of time.

90
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,720
For example, when I had the computer draw this bump curve here, the one representing

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,240
the velocity function, here's what I had the computer actually do.

92
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,620
First, I chose a small value for dt, I think in this case it was 0.01.

93
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,040
Then I had the computer look at a whole bunch of times t between 0 and 10, and compute the

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,580
distance function s at t plus dt, and then subtract off the value of that function at

95
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:44,820
t.

96
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,820
In other words, that's the difference in the distance traveled between the given time,

97
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,660
t, and the time 0.01 seconds after that.

98
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,160
Then you can just divide that difference by the change in time, dt, and that gives you

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,480
velocity in meters per second around each point in time.

100
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,780
So with a formula like this, you could give the computer any curve representing any distance

101
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,920
function s of t, and it could figure out the curve representing velocity.

102
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,200
Now would be a good time to pause, reflect, and make sure this idea of relating distance

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,520
to velocity by looking at tiny changes makes sense, because we're going to tackle the

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
paradox of the derivative head on.

105
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,620
This idea of ds over dt, a tiny change in the value of the function s divided by the

106
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,000
tiny change in the input that caused it, that's almost what a derivative is.

107
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,860
And even though a car's speedometer will actually look at a change in time, like 0.01

108
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,580
seconds, and even though the drawing program here is looking at an actual change in time,

109
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,760
in pure math the derivative is not this ratio ds over dt for a specific choice of dt, instead

110
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,760
it's whatever that ratio approaches as your choice for dt approaches 0.

111
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,880
Luckily there is a really nice visual understanding for what it means to ask what this ratio approaches,

112
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,560
Remember, for any specific choice of dt, this ratio ds over dt is the slope of a line passing

113
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,980
through two separate points on the graph, right?

114
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,080
Well as dt approaches 0, and as those two points approach each other, the slope of the

115
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,280
line approaches the slope of a line that's tangent to the graph at whatever point t we're

116
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,140
looking at.

117
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,380
So the true honest-to-goodness pure math derivative is not the rise over run slope between two

118
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,300
nearby points on the graph, it's equal to the slope of a line tangent to the graph at

119
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,000
a single point.

120
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,340
Now notice what I'm not saying, I'm not saying that the derivative is whatever happens

121
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,420
when dt is infinitely small, whatever that would mean.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,340
Nor am I saying that you plug in 0 for dt.

123
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,500
This dt is always a finitely small non-zero value, it's just that it approaches 0 is

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,900
all.

125
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,960
I think that's really clever.

126
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,280
Even though change in an instant makes no sense, this idea of letting dt approach 0

127
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,900
is a really sneaky backdoor way to talk reasonably about the rate of change at a single point

128
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,380
in time.

129
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,520
Isn't that neat?

130
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,820
It's kind of flirting with the paradox of change in an instant without ever needing

131
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,980
to actually touch it.

132
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,740
And it comes with such a nice visual intuition too, as the slope of a tangent line to a single

133
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,660
point on the graph.

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,900
And because change in an instant still makes no sense, I think it's healthiest for you

135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,660
to think of this slope not as some instantaneous rate of change, but instead as the best constant

136
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,720
approximation for a rate of change around a point.

137
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,940
By the way, it's worth saying a couple words on notation here.

138
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,000
Throughout this video I've been using dt to refer to a tiny change in t with some actual

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,340
size, and ds to refer to the resulting change in s, which again has an actual size, and

140
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,780
this is because that's how I want you to think about them.

141
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,040
But the convention in calculus is that whenever you're using the letter d like this, you're

142
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,700
kind of announcing your intention that eventually you're going to see what happens as dt approaches

143
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,100
0.

144
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,940
For example, the honest-to-goodness pure math derivative is written as ds divided by dt,

145
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,880
even though it's technically not a fraction per se, but whatever that fraction approaches

146
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,780
for smaller nudges in t.

147
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,680
I think a specific example should help here.

148
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,280
You might think that asking about what this ratio approaches for smaller and smaller values

149
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,500
would make it much more difficult to compute, but weirdly it kind of makes things easier.

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,160
Let's say you have a given distance vs time function that happens to be exactly t cubed.

151
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,240
So after 1 second the car has traveled 1 cubed equals 1 meters, after 2 seconds it's traveled

152
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,240
2 cubed, or 8 meters, and so on.

153
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,240
Now what I'm about to do might seem somewhat complicated, but once the dust settles it

154
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,800
really is simpler, and more importantly it's the kind of thing you only ever have to do

155
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,680
once in calculus.

156
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,300
Let's say you wanted to compute the velocity, ds divided by dt, at some specific time, like

157
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
t equals 2.

158
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,680
For right now let's think of dt as having an actual size, some concrete nudge, we'll

159
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,460
let it go to 0 in just a bit.

160
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:24,800
The tiny change in distance between 2 seconds and 2 plus dt seconds is s of 2 plus dt minus

161
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,940
s of 2, and we divide that by dt.

162
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,660
Since our function is t cubed, that numerator looks like 2 plus dt cubed minus 2 cubed.

163
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,100
And this is something we can work out algebraically.

164
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,320
Again, bear with me, there's a reason I'm showing you the details here.

165
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,760
When you expand that top, what you get is 2 cubed plus 3 times 2 squared dt plus 3 times

166
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,260
2 times dt squared plus dt cubed, and all of that is minus 2 cubed.

167
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,140
Now there's a lot of terms, and I want you to remember that it looks like a mess, but

168
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,880
it does simplify.

169
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,900
Those 2 cubed terms cancel out.

170
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,700
Everything remaining here has a dt in it, and since there's a dt on the bottom there,

171
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,560
many of those cancel out as well.

172
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,740
What this means is that the ratio ds divided by dt has boiled down into 3 times 2 squared

173
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,860
plus 2 different terms that each have a dt in them.

174
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,860
So if we ask what happens as dt approaches 0, representing the idea of looking at a smaller

175
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,680
and smaller change in time, we can just completely ignore those other terms.

176
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,980
By eliminating the need to think about a specific dt, we've eliminated a lot of the complication

177
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,100
in the full expression.

178
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,360
So what we're left with is this nice clean 3 times 2 squared.

179
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,480
You can think of that as meaning that the slope of a line tangent to the point at t

180
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,920
equals 2 of this graph is exactly 3 times 2 squared, or 12.

181
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,060
And of course, there's nothing special about the time t equals 2.

182
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,080
We could more generally say that the derivative of t cubed as a function of t is 3 times t squared.

183
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,220
Now take a step back, because that's beautiful.

184
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,280
The derivative is this crazy complicated idea.

185
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,900
We've got tiny changes in distance over tiny changes in time, but instead of looking at

186
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,500
any specific one of those, we're talking about what that thing approaches.

187
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,980
I mean, that's a lot to think about.

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,560
And yet what we've come out with is such a simple expression, 3 times t squared.

189
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,060
And in practice, you wouldn't go through all this algebra each time.

190
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,460
Knowing that the derivative of t cubed is 3t squared is one of those things that all

191
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,500
calculus students learn how to do immediately without having to re-derive it each time.

192
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,300
And in the next video, I'm going to show you a nice way to think about this and a couple

193
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,760
other derivative formulas in really nice geometric ways.

194
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,660
But the point I want to make by showing you all of the algebraic guts here is that when

195
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,700
you consider the tiny change in distance caused by a tiny change in time for some specific

196
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,600
value of dt, you'd have kind of a mess.

197
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,540
But when you consider what that ratio approaches as dt approaches 0, it lets you ignore much

198
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,020
of that mess, and it really does simplify the problem.

199
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,720
That right there is kind of the heart of why calculus becomes useful.

200
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,360
Another reason to show you a concrete derivative like this is that it sets the stage for an

201
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,060
example of the kind of paradoxes that come about if you believe too much in the illusion

202
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,700
of instantaneous rate of change.

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,120
So think about the actual car traveling according to this t cubed distance function, and consider

204
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,720
its motion at the moment t equals 0, right at the start.

205
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,380
Now ask yourself whether or not the car is moving at that time.

206
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,420
On the one hand, we can compute its speed at that point using the derivative, 3t squared,

207
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,700
which for time t equals 0 works out to be 0.

208
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,320
Visually, this means that the tangent line to the graph at that point is perfectly flat,

209
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,400
so the car's quote-unquote instantaneous velocity is 0, and that suggests that obviously

210
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,140
it's not moving.

211
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,860
But on the other hand, if it doesn't start moving at time 0, when does it start moving?

212
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,540
Really, pause and ponder that for a moment.

213
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,780
Is the car moving at time t equals 0?

214
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,380
Do you see the paradox?

215
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,000
The issue is that the question makes no sense.

216
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,440
It references the idea of change in a moment, but that doesn't actually exist.

217
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,600
That's just not what the derivative measures.

218
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,440
What it means for the derivative of a distance function to be 0 is that the best constant

219
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,320
approximation for the car's velocity around that point is 0 m per second.

220
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,580
For example, if you look at an actual change in time, say between time 0 and 0.1 seconds,

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
the car does move.

222
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
It moves 0.001 m.

223
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,940
That's very small, and importantly, it's very small compared to the change in time,

224
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,980
giving an average speed of only 0.01 m per second.

225
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,100
And remember, what it means for the derivative of this motion to be 0 is that for smaller

226
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,860
and smaller nudges in time, this ratio of m per second approaches 0.

227
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,720
But that's not to say that the car is static.

228
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,820
Approximating its movement with a constant velocity of 0 is, after all, just an approximation.

229
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,500
So whenever you hear people refer to the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change,

230
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,980
a phrase which is intrinsically oxymoronic,

231
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,680
I want you to think of that as a conceptual shorthand for the best constant approximation for rate of change.

232
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,640
In the next couple videos, I'll be talking more about the derivative,

233
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,380
what it looks like in different contexts, how do you actually compute it, why is it useful, things like that,

234
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,760
focusing on visual intuition as always.
