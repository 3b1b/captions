1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
I've introduced a few derivative formulas, but a really important one that I left out

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,840
was exponentials.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,100
So here I want to talk about the derivatives of functions like 2 to the x, 7 to the x,

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,340
and also to show why e to the x is arguably the most important of the exponentials.

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,860
First of all, to get an intuition, let's just focus on the function 2 to the x.

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,380
Let's think of that input as a time, t, maybe in days, and the output, 2 to the t,

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,380
as a population size, perhaps of a particularly fertile band of pie creatures which doubles

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,220
every single day.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,860
And actually, instead of population size, which grows in discrete little jumps with

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,900
each new baby pie creature, maybe let's think of 2 to the t as the total mass of the

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
population.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,420
I think that better reflects the continuity of this function, don't you?

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,980
So for example, at time t equals 0, the total mass is 2 to the 0 equals 1 for the mass of

14
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,660
one creature.

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,040
At t equals 1 day, the population has grown to 2 to the 1 equals 2 creature masses.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,820
At day t equals 2, it's t squared, or 4, and in general it just keeps doubling every

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,820
day.

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,840
For the derivative, we want dm dt, the rate at which this population mass is growing,

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,100
thought of as a tiny change in the mass divided by a tiny change in time.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,380
And let's start by thinking of the rate of change over a full day, say between day

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,980
3 and day 4.

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,340
In this case, it grows from 8 to 16, so that's 8 new creature masses added over the course

23
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,100
of 1 day.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,780
And notice that rate of growth equals the population size at the start of the day.

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,660
Between day 4 and day 5, it grows from 16 to 32, so that's a rate of 16 new creature

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,620
masses per day, which again equals the population size at the start of the day.

27
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,680
And in general, this rate of growth over a full day equals the population size at the

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,780
start of that day.

29
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,180
So it might be tempting to say that this means the derivative of 2 to the t equals itself,

30
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,040
that the rate of change of this function at a given time t is equal to the value of that

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
function.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,480
And this is definitely in the right direction, but it's not quite correct.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,280
What we're doing here is making comparisons over a full day, considering the difference

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,920
between 2 to the t plus 1 and 2 to the t.

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,080
But for the derivative, we need to ask what happens for smaller and smaller changes.

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,700
What's the growth over the course of a tenth of a day, a hundredth of a day, one one billionth

37
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,360
of a day?

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,420
This is why I had us think of the function as representing population mass, since it

39
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,300
makes sense to ask about a tiny change in mass over a tiny fraction of a day, but it

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,020
doesn't make as much sense to ask about the tiny change in a discrete population size

41
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,980
per second.

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,940
More abstractly, for a tiny change in time, dt, we want to understand the difference between

43
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,540
2 to the t plus dt and 2 to the t, all divided by dt, the change in the function per unit

44
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,900
time, but now we're looking very narrowly, around a given point in time, rather than

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,740
over the course of a full day.

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,240
And here's the thing, I would love if there was some very clear geometric picture that

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,700
made everything that's about to follow just pop out, some diagram where you could point

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,740
to one value and say, see, that part, that is the derivative of 2 to the t.

49
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,060
And if you know of one, please let me know.

50
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,180
And while the goal here, as with the rest of the series, is to maintain a playful spirit

51
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,740
of discovery, the type of play that follows will have more to do with finding numerical

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,700
patterns rather than visual ones.

53
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,340
So start by just taking a very close look at this term, 2 to the t plus dt.

54
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,100
A core property of exponentials is that you can break this up as 2 to the t times 2 to

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,740
the dt.

56
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,760
That really is the most important property of exponents.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,720
If you add two values in that exponent, you can break up the output as a product of some

58
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,880
kind.

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,640
This is what lets you relate additive ideas, things like tiny steps in time, to multiplicative

60
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,880
ideas, things like rates and ratios.

61
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,080
Just look at what happens here.

62
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,320
After that move, we can factor out the term 2 to the t, which is now multiplied by 2 to

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,800
the dt minus 1, all divided by dt.

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,800
And remember, the derivative of 2 to the t is whatever this whole expression approaches

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,680
as dt approaches 0.

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,120
At first glance, that might seem like an unimportant manipulation, but a tremendously important

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,440
fact is that this term on the right, where all of the dt stuff lives, is completely separate

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,400
from the t term itself.

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,880
It doesn't depend on the actual time where we started.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,840
You can go off to a calculator and plug in very small values for dt here, for example

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,880
maybe typing in 2 to the 0.001 minus 1 divided by 0.001.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,680
What you'll find is that for smaller and smaller choices of dt, this value approaches

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
a very specific number, around 0.6931.

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't worry if that number seems mysterious, the central point is that this is some kind

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
of constant.

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,480
Unlike derivatives of other functions, all of the stuff that depends on dt is separate

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,040
from the value of t itself.

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,600
The derivative of 2 to the t is just itself, but multiplied by some constant.

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,320
That should make sense, because earlier it felt like the derivative for 2 to the t should

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,320
be itself, at least when we were looking at changes over the course of a full day.

81
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,040
And evidently, the rate of change for this function over much smaller timescales is not

82
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,280
quite equal to itself, but proportional to itself, with this peculiar proportionality

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,280
constant of 0.6931.

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,960
And there's not too much special about the number 2 here.

85
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,560
If instead we had dealt with the function 3 to the t, the exponential property would

86
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,680
also have led us to the conclusion that the derivative of 3 to the t is proportional to

87
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,840
itself.

88
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,440
But this time it would have had a proportionality constant 1.0986.

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,560
And for other bases to your exponent, you can have fun trying to see what the various

90
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,480
proportionality constants are, maybe seeing if you can find a pattern in them.

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,000
For example, if you plug in 8 to the power of a very tiny number, minus 1, and divide

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,680
by that same tiny number, what you'd find is that the relevant proportionality constant

93
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,880
is around 2.079.

94
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,240
And maybe, just maybe, you would notice that this number happens to be exactly 3 times

95
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,600
the constant associated with the base for 2.

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,760
So these numbers certainly aren't random, there is some kind of pattern, but what is

97
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
it?

98
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,200
What does 2 have to do with the number 0.6931?

99
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,520
And what does 8 have to do with the number 2.079?

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Well, a second question that is ultimately going to explain these mystery constants is

101
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,240
whether there is some base where that proportionality constant is 1, where the derivative of a to

102
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,160
the power t is not just proportional to itself, but actually equal to itself.

103
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
And there is!

104
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,360
It's the special constant e, around 2.71828.

105
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,380
In fact, it's not just that the number e happens to show up here, this is in a sense

106
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,660
what defines the number e.

107
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,760
If you ask why does e of all numbers have this property, it's a little like asking

108
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,440
why does pi of all numbers happen to be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,880
its diameter.

110
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,220
This is at its heart what defines this value.

111
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,020
All exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative, but e alone is the

112
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,860
special number so that that proportionality constant is 1, meaning e to the t actually

113
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,540
equals its own derivative.

114
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,820
One way to think of that is that if you look at the graph of e to the t, it has the peculiar

115
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,100
property that the slope of a tangent line to any point on this graph equals the height

116
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,080
of that point above the horizontal axis.

117
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,780
The existence of a function like this answers the question of the mystery constants, and

118
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,300
it's because it gives a different way to think about functions that are proportional

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,240
to their own derivative.

120
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,000
The key is to use the chain rule.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,360
For example, what is the derivative of e to the 3t?

122
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,240
Well you take the derivative of the outermost function, which due to this special nature

123
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,180
of e is just itself, and then multiply by the derivative of that inner function 3t,

124
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,600
which is the constant 3.

125
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Or rather than just applying a rule blindly, you could take this moment to practice the

126
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
intuition for the chain rule that I talked through last video, thinking about how a slight

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
nudge to t changes the value of 3t, and how that intermediate change nudges the final

128
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,840
value of e to the 3t.

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,120
Either way, the point is e to the power of some constant times t is equal to that same

130
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,020
constant times itself.

131
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,320
And from here, the question of those mystery constants really just comes down to a certain

132
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,540
algebraic manipulation.

133
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,420
The number 2 can also be written as e to the natural log of 2.

134
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,340
There's nothing fancy here, this is just the definition of the natural log.

135
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,840
It asks the question e to the what equals 2.

136
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,940
So the function 2 to the t is the same as the function e to the power of the natural

137
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,380
log of 2 times t.

138
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,380
And from what we just saw, combining the fact that e to the t is its own derivative with

139
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,260
the chain rule, the derivative of this function is proportional to itself, with a proportionality

140
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,100
constant equal to the natural log of 2.

141
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,420
And indeed, if you go plug in the natural log of 2 to a calculator, you'll find that

142
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,220
it's 0.6931, the mystery constant we ran into earlier.

143
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,900
And the same goes for all the other bases.

144
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,700
The mystery proportionality constant that pops up when taking derivatives is just the

145
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,080
natural log of the base.

146
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,640
The answer to the question e to the what equals that base.

147
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,140
In fact, throughout applications of calculus, you rarely see exponentials written as some

148
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,960
base to a power t.

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,200
Instead you almost always write the exponential as e to the power of some constant times t.

150
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,360
It's all equivalent, I mean any function like 2 to the t or 3 to the t can also be

151
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,860
written as e to some constant times t.

152
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,200
At the risk of staying over-focused on the symbols here, I want to emphasize that there

153
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,560
are many ways to write down any particular exponential function.

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,840
And when you see something written as e to some constant times t, that's a choice we

155
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,820
make to write it that way, and the number e is not fundamental to that function itself.

156
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,780
What is special about writing exponentials in terms of e like this is that it gives that

157
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,020
constant in the exponent a nice readable meaning.

158
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,420
Here, let me show you what I mean.

159
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,100
All sorts of natural phenomena involve some rate of change that's proportional to the

160
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,260
thing that's changing.

161
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,300
For example, the rate of growth of a population actually does tend to be proportional to the

162
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,140
size of the population itself, assuming there isn't some limited resource slowing things

163
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,660
down.

164
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,060
If you put a cup of hot water in a cool room, the rate at which the water cools is proportional

165
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,700
to the difference in temperature between the room and the water, or the rate at which that

166
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,100
difference changes is proportional to itself.

167
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,140
If you invest your money, the rate at which it grows is proportional to the amount of

168
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,200
money there at any time.

169
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,840
In all of these cases, where some variable's rate of change is proportional to itself,

170
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,800
the function describing that variable over time is going to look like some kind of exponential.

171
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,780
And even though there are lots of ways to write any exponential function, it's very

172
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:02,200
natural to choose to express these functions as e to the power of some constant times t,

173
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,240
since that constant carries a very natural meaning.

174
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,560
It's the same as the proportionality constant between the size of the changing variable

175
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,680
and the rate of change.

176
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,960
And as always, I want to thank those who have made this series possible.

177
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Thank you.
