1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,328
I've introduced a few derivative formulas, but a 

2
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:20,160
really important one that I left out was exponentials.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,060
So here I want to talk about the derivatives of functions like 2 to the x, 7 to the x, 

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,040
and also to show why e to the x is arguably the most important of the exponentials.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,120
First of all, to get an intuition, let's just focus on the function 2 to the x.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,505
Let's think of that input as a time, t, maybe in days, and the output, 

7
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:45,380
2 to the t, as a population size, perhaps of a particularly 

8
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,320
fertile band of pie creatures which doubles every single day.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,979
And actually, instead of population size, which grows in discrete little jumps with each 

10
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,850
new baby pie creature, maybe let's think of 2 to the t as the total mass of the 

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,520
population.

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,319
I think that better reflects the continuity of this function, don't you?

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,644
So for example, at time t equals 0, the total mass is 2 to the 0 equals 1, 

14
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:13,680
for the mass of one creature.

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,200
At t equals 1 day, the population has grown to 2 to the 1 equals 2 creature masses.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,120
At day t equals 2, it's t squared, or 4, and in general it just keeps doubling every day.

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,989
For the derivative, we want dm dt, the rate at which this population mass is growing, 

18
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,920
thought of as a tiny change in the mass, divided by a tiny change in time.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,146
Let's start by thinking of the rate of change over a full day, 

20
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,060
say between day 3 and day 4.

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,208
In this case, it grows from 8 to 16, so that's 8 

22
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:54,220
new creature masses added over the course of one day.

23
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,840
And notice, that rate of growth equals the population size at the start of the day.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,850
Between day 4 and day 5, it grows from 16 to 32, 

25
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,426
so that's a rate of 16 new creature masses per day, 

26
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:12,760
which again equals the population size at the start of the day.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,090
And in general, this rate of growth over a full day 

28
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,660
equals the population size at the start of that day.

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,760
So it might be tempting to say that this means the derivative 

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,775
of 2 to the t equals itself, that the rate of change of this 

31
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:34,120
function at a given time t is equal to the value of that function.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,880
And this is definitely in the right direction, but it's not quite correct.

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,365
What we're doing here is making comparisons over a full day, 

34
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,720
considering the difference between 2 to the t plus 1 and 2 to the t.

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,340
But for the derivative, we need to ask what happens for smaller and smaller changes.

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,741
What's the growth over the course of a tenth of a day, 

37
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,220
a hundredth of a day, one one billionth of a day?

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,229
This is why I had us think of the function as representing population mass, 

39
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:09,117
since it makes sense to ask about a tiny change in mass over a tiny fraction of a day, 

40
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:14,061
but it doesn't make as much sense to ask about the tiny change in a discrete population 

41
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:14,960
size per second.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,595
More abstractly, for a tiny change in time, dt, 

43
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:25,754
we want to understand the difference between 2 to the t plus dt and 2 to the t, 

44
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,140
all divided by dt.

45
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,204
The change in the function per unit time, but now we're looking very narrowly 

46
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:36,400
around a given point in time, rather than over the course of a full day.

47
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,139
And here's the thing, I would love if there was some very clear geometric picture 

48
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,364
that made everything that's about to follow just pop out, 

49
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:51,422
some diagram where you could point to one value and say, see, that part, 

50
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:53,480
that is the derivative of 2 to the t.

51
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,640
And if you know of one, please let me know.

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,908
And while the goal here, as with the rest of the series, 

53
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:03,353
is to maintain a playful spirit of discovery, the type of play that 

54
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:07,660
follows will have more to do with finding numerical patterns rather than visual ones.

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,560
So start by just taking a very close look at this term, 2 to the t plus dt.

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,607
A core property of exponentials is that you can 

57
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,720
break this up as 2 to the t times 2 to the dt.

58
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,120
That really is the most important property of exponents.

59
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,458
If you add two values in that exponent, you can 

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,140
break up the output as a product of some kind.

61
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,852
This is what lets you relate additive ideas, things like tiny steps in time, 

62
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:37,680
to multiplicative ideas, things like rates and ratios.

63
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,960
I mean, just look at what happens here.

64
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,808
After that move, we can factor out the term 2 to the t, 

65
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:49,840
which is now just multiplied by 2 to the dt minus 1, all divided by dt.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,184
And remember, the derivative of 2 to the t is whatever 

67
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:57,460
this whole expression approaches as dt approaches 0.

68
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,080
And at first glance, that might seem like an unimportant manipulation.

69
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,377
But a tremendously important fact is that this term on the right, 

70
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:10,780
where all of the dt stuff lives, is completely separate from the t term itself.

71
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,920
It doesn't depend on the actual time where we started.

72
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,684
You can go off to a calculator and plug in very small values for dt here, 

73
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:26,340
for example, maybe typing in 2 to the 0.001 minus 1 divided by 0.001.

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,818
What you'll find is that for smaller and smaller choices of dt, 

75
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:37,560
this value approaches a very specific number, around 0.6931.

76
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,036
Don't worry if that number seems mysterious, the 

77
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,580
central point is that this is some kind of constant.

78
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,252
Unlike derivatives of other functions, all of the stuff 

79
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:52,140
that depends on dt is separate from the value of t itself.

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,120
So the derivative of 2 to the t is just itself, but multiplied by some constant.

81
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,818
And that should make sense, because earlier it felt like the derivative for 2 to the t 

82
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:08,440
should be itself, at least when we were looking at changes over the course of a full day.

83
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,778
And evidently, the rate of change for this function over much smaller 

84
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:18,797
timescales is not quite equal to itself, but it's proportional to itself, 

85
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:22,800
with this very peculiar proportionality constant of 0.6931.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,200
And there's not too much special about the number 2 here.

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,140
If instead we had dealt with the function 3 to the t, 

88
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,396
the exponential property would also have led us to the conclusion that the derivative 

89
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:45,980
of 3 to the t is proportional to itself, but this time it would have had a 

90
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,120
proportionality constant of 1.0986.

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,157
And for other bases to your exponent, you can have fun trying to see what the 

92
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:57,520
various proportionality constants are, maybe seeing if you can find a pattern in them.

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,382
For example, if you plug in 8 to the power of a very tiny number, 

94
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:08,063
minus 1, and divide by that same tiny number, you'd find that 

95
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:12,140
the relevant proportionality constant is around 2.079.

96
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,145
And maybe, just maybe, you would notice that this number happens 

97
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,700
to be exactly 3 times the constant associated with the base for 2.

98
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,960
So these numbers certainly aren't random, there is some kind of pattern, but what is it?

99
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,714
What does 2 have to do with the number 0.6931, 

100
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:35,400
and what does 8 have to do with the number 2.079?

101
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,246
Well, a second question that is ultimately going to explain these mystery constants is 

102
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:46,519
whether there's some base where that proportionality constant is 1, 

103
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,357
where the derivative of a to the power t is not just proportional to itself, 

104
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:53,180
but actually equal to itself.

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,680
And there is!

106
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,300
It's the special constant e around 2.71828.

107
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,422
In fact, it's not just that the number e happens to show up here, 

108
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:07,220
this is in a sense what defines the number e.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,581
If you ask why does e of all numbers have this property, 

110
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,720
it's a little like asking why does pi of all numbers happen 

111
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,120
to be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

112
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,280
This is at its heart what defines this value.

113
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,272
All exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative, 

114
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,794
but e alone is the special number so that proportionality constant is 1, 

115
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:34,140
meaning e to the t actually equals its own derivative.

116
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,488
One way to think of that is that if you look at the graph of e to the t, 

117
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:43,647
it has the peculiar property that the slope of a tangent line to any point 

118
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:47,640
on this graph equals the height of that point above the horizontal axis.

119
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,855
The existence of a function like this answers the question of the mystery constants, 

120
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:56,083
and it's because it gives a different way to think about functions 

121
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,300
that are proportional to their own derivative.

122
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
The key is to use the chain rule.

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,300
For example, what is the derivative of e to the 3t?

124
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,907
Well, you take the derivative of the outermost function, 

125
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,287
which due to this special nature of e is just itself, 

126
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:18,420
and multiply by the derivative of that inner function 3t, which is the constant 3.

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,435
Or rather than applying a rule blindly, you could take this moment 

128
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:27,708
to practice the intuition for the chain rule I talked about last video, 

129
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,506
thinking about how a slight nudge to t changes the value of 3t, 

130
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:35,720
and how that intermediate change nudges the final value of e to the 3t.

131
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,802
Either way, the point is e to the power of some constant 

132
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:46,800
times t is equal to that same constant times itself.

133
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,182
And from here, the question of those mystery constants 

134
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:54,640
really just comes down to a certain algebraic manipulation.

135
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,060
The number 2 can also be written as e to the natural log of 2.

136
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,392
There's nothing fancy here, this is just the definition of the natural log, 

137
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:09,480
it asks the question e to the what equals 2.

138
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,896
So the function 2 to the t is the same as the function 

139
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:18,380
e to the power of the natural log of 2 times t.

140
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,415
And from what we just saw, combining the fact that e to the t is its own 

141
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,904
derivative with the chain rule, the derivative of this function is proportional 

142
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:33,000
to itself, with a proportionality constant equal to the natural log of 2.

143
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,404
And indeed, if you go plug in the natural log of 2 to a calculator, 

144
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,920
you'll find that it's 0.6931, the mystery constant we ran into earlier.

145
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,220
And the same goes for all the other bases.

146
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,089
The mystery proportionality constant that pops up when 

147
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,420
taking derivatives is just the natural log of the base.

148
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,787
In fact, throughout applications of calculus, you rarely 

149
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:07,380
see exponentials written as some base to a power t.

150
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,861
Instead, you almost always write the exponential 

151
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,320
as e to the power of some constant times t.

152
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,285
It's all equivalent, I mean any function like 2 to the t or 

153
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:22,440
3 to the t can also be written as e to some constant times t.

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,939
At the risk of staying overfocused on the symbols here, 

155
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:32,457
I want to emphasize that there are many ways to write down any particular 

156
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:33,740
exponential function.

157
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,506
And when you see something written as e to some constant times t, 

158
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:43,665
that's a choice we make to write it that way, and the number e is not fundamental to 

159
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:44,940
that function itself.

160
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,729
What is special about writing exponentials in terms of e like this is 

161
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:53,780
that it gives that constant in the exponent a nice readable meaning.

162
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,540
Here, let me show you what I mean.

163
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,159
All sorts of natural phenomena involve some rate of 

164
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,260
change that's proportional to the thing that's changing.

165
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,648
For example, the rate of growth of a population actually does 

166
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:10,036
tend to be proportional to the size of the population itself, 

167
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:13,480
assuming there isn't some limited resource slowing things down.

168
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,278
And if you put a cup of hot water in a cool room, 

169
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,555
the rate at which the water cools is proportional to the difference in temperature 

170
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:26,496
between the room and the water, or said a little differently, 

171
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:30,820
the rate at which that difference changes is proportional to itself.

172
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,584
If you invest your money, the rate at which it grows is 

173
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:39,080
proportional to the amount of money there at any time.

174
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,054
In all of these cases, where some variable's rate of change is proportional to itself, 

175
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:48,582
the function describing that variable over time is going to 

176
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,640
look like some kind of exponential.

177
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,100
And even though there are lots of ways to write any exponential function, 

178
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,383
it's very natural to choose to express these functions as e to the power 

179
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:04,900
of some constant times t, since that constant carries a very natural meaning.

180
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,217
It's the same as the proportionality constant between 

181
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:11,720
the size of the changing variable and the rate of change.

182
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,860
And as always, I want to thank those who have made this series possible.

183
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:49,500
Thank you.
