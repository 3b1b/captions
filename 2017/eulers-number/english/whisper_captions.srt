1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,960
I've introduced a few derivative formulas, but a really important one that I left out

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,160
was exponentials.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,580
So here I want to talk about the derivatives of functions like 2 to the x, 7 to the x,

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,040
and also to show why e to the x is arguably the most important of the exponentials.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,120
First of all, to get an intuition, let's just focus on the function 2 to the x.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,100
Let's think of that input as a time, t, maybe in days, and the output, 2 to the t,

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,180
as a population size, perhaps of a particularly fertile band of pie creatures which doubles

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,320
every single day.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,940
And actually, instead of population size, which grows in discrete little jumps with

10
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,980
each new baby pie creature, maybe let's think of 2 to the t as the total mass of the

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,520
population.

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,320
I think that better reflects the continuity of this function, don't you?

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,900
So for example, at time t equals 0, the total mass is 2 to the 0 equals 1, for the mass

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,680
of one creature.

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,200
At t equals 1 day, the population has grown to 2 to the 1 equals 2 creature masses.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,760
At day t equals 2, it's t squared, or 4, and in general it just keeps doubling every

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,120
day.

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,520
For the derivative, we want dm dt, the rate at which this population mass is growing,

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,920
thought of as a tiny change in the mass, divided by a tiny change in time.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,400
Let's start by thinking of the rate of change over a full day, say between day 3 and day

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,060
4.

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,380
In this case, it grows from 8 to 16, so that's 8 new creature masses added over the course

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,220
of one day.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,840
And notice, that rate of growth equals the population size at the start of the day.

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Between day 4 and day 5, it grows from 16 to 32, so that's a rate of 16 new creature

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,760
masses per day, which again equals the population size at the start of the day.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,800
And in general, this rate of growth over a full day equals the population size at the

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,660
start of that day.

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,180
So it might be tempting to say that this means the derivative of 2 to the t equals itself,

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,680
that the rate of change of this function at a given time t is equal to the value of that

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,120
function.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,880
And this is definitely in the right direction, but it's not quite correct.

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,320
What we're doing here is making comparisons over a full day, considering the difference

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,720
between 2 to the t plus 1 and 2 to the t.

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,340
But for the derivative, we need to ask what happens for smaller and smaller changes.

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,780
What's the growth over the course of a tenth of a day, a hundredth of a day, one one billionth

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,220
of a day?

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,480
This is why I had us think of the function as representing population mass, since it

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,400
makes sense to ask about a tiny change in mass over a tiny fraction of a day, but it

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,920
doesn't make as much sense to ask about the tiny change in a discrete population size

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,960
per second.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,000
More abstractly, for a tiny change in time, dt, we want to understand the difference between

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,140
2 to the t plus dt and 2 to the t, all divided by dt.

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,880
The change in the function per unit time, but now we're looking very narrowly around

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,400
a given point in time, rather than over the course of a full day.

46
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,300
And here's the thing, I would love if there was some very clear geometric picture that

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,720
made everything that's about to follow just pop out, some diagram where you could point

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,480
to one value and say, see, that part, that is the derivative of 2 to the t.

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,640
And if you know of one, please let me know.

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,160
And while the goal here, as with the rest of the series, is to maintain a playful spirit

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,700
of discovery, the type of play that follows will have more to do with finding numerical

52
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,660
patterns rather than visual ones.

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,560
So start by just taking a very close look at this term, 2 to the t plus dt.

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,160
A core property of exponentials is that you can break this up as 2 to the t times 2 to

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,720
the dt.

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,120
That really is the most important property of exponents.

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,780
If you add two values in that exponent, you can break up the output as a product of some

58
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,140
kind.

59
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,620
This is what lets you relate additive ideas, things like tiny steps in time, to multiplicative

60
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,680
ideas, things like rates and ratios.

61
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,960
I mean, just look at what happens here.

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,700
After that move, we can factor out the term 2 to the t, which is now just multiplied by

63
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,840
2 to the dt minus 1, all divided by dt.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,340
And remember, the derivative of 2 to the t is whatever this whole expression approaches

65
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,460
as dt approaches 0.

66
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,080
And at first glance, that might seem like an unimportant manipulation.

67
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,360
But a tremendously important fact is that this term on the right, where all of the dt

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,780
stuff lives, is completely separate from the t term itself.

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,920
It doesn't depend on the actual time where we started.

70
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,780
You can go off to a calculator and plug in very small values for dt here, for example,

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,340
maybe typing in 2 to the 0.001 minus 1 divided by 0.001.

72
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,660
What you'll find is that for smaller and smaller choices of dt, this value approaches

73
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,560
a very specific number, around 0.6931.

74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't worry if that number seems mysterious, the central point is that this is some kind

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,580
of constant.

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,360
Unlike derivatives of other functions, all of the stuff that depends on dt is separate

77
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,140
from the value of t itself.

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,120
So the derivative of 2 to the t is just itself, but multiplied by some constant.

79
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,120
And that should make sense, because earlier it felt like the derivative for 2 to the t

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,440
should be itself, at least when we were looking at changes over the course of a full day.

81
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,100
And evidently, the rate of change for this function over much smaller timescales is not

82
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,340
quite equal to itself, but it's proportional to itself, with this very peculiar proportionality

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,800
constant of 0.6931.

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,200
And there's not too much special about the number 2 here.

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,540
If instead we had dealt with the function 3 to the t, the exponential property would

86
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,580
also have led us to the conclusion that the derivative of 3 to the t is proportional to

87
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,120
itself, but this time it would have had a proportionality constant of 1.0986.

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,620
And for other bases to your exponent, you can have fun trying to see what the various

89
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,520
proportionality constants are, maybe seeing if you can find a pattern in them.

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,020
For example, if you plug in 8 to the power of a very tiny number, minus 1, and divide

91
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,280
by that same tiny number, you'd find that the relevant proportionality constant is around

92
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,140
2.079.

93
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:19,100
And maybe, just maybe, you would notice that this number happens to be exactly 3 times

94
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,700
the constant associated with the base for 2.

95
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,720
So these numbers certainly aren't random, there is some kind of pattern, but what is

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:27,960
it?

97
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,880
What does 2 have to do with the number 0.6931, and what does 8 have to do with the number

98
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,400
2.079?

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,580
Well, a second question that is ultimately going to explain these mystery constants is

100
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,300
whether there's some base where that proportionality constant is 1, where the derivative of a to

101
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,180
the power t is not just proportional to itself, but actually equal to itself.

102
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,680
And there is!

103
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,300
It's the special constant e around 2.71828.

104
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,240
In fact, it's not just that the number e happens to show up here, this is in a sense

105
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,220
what defines the number e.

106
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,820
If you ask why does e of all numbers have this property, it's a little like asking

107
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,540
why does pi of all numbers happen to be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to

108
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,120
its diameter.

109
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,280
This is at its heart what defines this value.

110
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,120
All exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative, but e alone is the

111
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,560
special number so that proportionality constant is 1, meaning e to the t actually equals its

112
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,140
own derivative.

113
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,780
One way to think of that is that if you look at the graph of e to the t, it has the peculiar

114
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,160
property that the slope of a tangent line to any point on this graph equals the height

115
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,640
of that point above the horizontal axis.

116
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,740
The existence of a function like this answers the question of the mystery constants, and

117
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,200
it's because it gives a different way to think about functions that are proportional

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,300
to their own derivative.

119
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
The key is to use the chain rule.

120
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,300
For example, what is the derivative of e to the 3t?

121
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,300
Well, you take the derivative of the outermost function, which due to this special nature

122
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,280
of e is just itself, and multiply by the derivative of that inner function 3t, which

123
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,420
is the constant 3.

124
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,200
Or rather than applying a rule blindly, you could take this moment to practice the intuition

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,280
for the chain rule I talked about last video, thinking about how a slight nudge to t changes

126
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,080
the value of 3t, and how that intermediate change nudges the final value of e to the

127
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,720
3t.

128
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,180
Either way, the point is e to the power of some constant times t is equal to that same

129
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,800
constant times itself.

130
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,240
And from here, the question of those mystery constants really just comes down to a certain

131
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,640
algebraic manipulation.

132
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,060
The number 2 can also be written as e to the natural log of 2.

133
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,660
There's nothing fancy here, this is just the definition of the natural log, it asks

134
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,480
the question e to the what equals 2.

135
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,960
So the function 2 to the t is the same as the function e to the power of the natural

136
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,380
log of 2 times t.

137
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,460
And from what we just saw, combining the fact that e to the t is its own derivative with

138
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,320
the chain rule, the derivative of this function is proportional to itself, with a proportionality

139
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,000
constant equal to the natural log of 2.

140
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,480
And indeed, if you go plug in the natural log of 2 to a calculator, you'll find that

141
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,920
it's 0.6931, the mystery constant we ran into earlier.

142
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,220
And the same goes for all the other bases.

143
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,800
The mystery proportionality constant that pops up when taking derivatives is just the

144
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,420
natural log of the base.

145
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:06,240
In fact, throughout applications of calculus, you rarely see exponentials written as some

146
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,380
base to a power t.

147
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,320
Instead, you almost always write the exponential as e to the power of some constant times t.

148
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,480
It's all equivalent, I mean any function like 2 to the t or 3 to the t can also be

149
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,440
written as e to some constant times t.

150
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,280
At the risk of staying overfocused on the symbols here, I want to emphasize that there

151
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,740
are many ways to write down any particular exponential function.

152
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,880
And when you see something written as e to some constant times t, that's a choice we

153
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,940
make to write it that way, and the number e is not fundamental to that function itself.

154
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,860
What is special about writing exponentials in terms of e like this is that it gives that

155
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,780
constant in the exponent a nice readable meaning.

156
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,540
Here, let me show you what I mean.

157
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,280
All sorts of natural phenomena involve some rate of change that's proportional to the

158
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,260
thing that's changing.

159
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,440
For example, the rate of growth of a population actually does tend to be proportional to the

160
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,060
size of the population itself, assuming there isn't some limited resource slowing things

161
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,480
down.

162
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,180
And if you put a cup of hot water in a cool room, the rate at which the water cools is

163
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,620
proportional to the difference in temperature between the room and the water, or said a

164
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,820
little differently, the rate at which that difference changes is proportional to itself.

165
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,320
If you invest your money, the rate at which it grows is proportional to the amount of

166
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,080
money there at any time.

167
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,060
In all of these cases, where some variable's rate of change is proportional to itself,

168
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,640
the function describing that variable over time is going to look like some kind of exponential.

169
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,860
And even though there are lots of ways to write any exponential function, it's very

170
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,520
natural to choose to express these functions as e to the power of some constant times t,

171
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,900
since that constant carries a very natural meaning.

172
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,080
It's the same as the proportionality constant between the size of the changing variable

173
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,720
and the rate of change.

174
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,860
And as always, I want to thank those who have made this series possible.

175
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:49,500
Thank you.
