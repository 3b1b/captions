1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Here, I want to discuss one common type of problem where integration comes up, finding

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,620
the average of a continuous variable.

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,120
This is a perfectly useful thing to know in its own right, but what's really neat is

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,280
that it can give us a completely different perspective for why integrals and derivatives

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,580
are inverses of each other.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,520
To start, take a look at the graph of sinx between 0 and pi, which is half of its period.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,200
What is the average height of this graph on that interval?

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
It's not a useless question.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,040
All sorts of cyclic phenomena in the world are modeled using sine waves.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,840
For example, the number of hours the sun is up per day as a function of what day of the

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,840
year it is follows a sine wave pattern.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,200
So if you wanted to predict the average effectiveness of solar panels in summer months vs. winter

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,200
months, you'd want to be able to answer a question like this, what is the average

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,960
value of that sine function over half of its period?

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,800
Where as a case like this is going to have all sorts of constants mucking up the function,

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,320
you and I are going to focus on a pure, unencumbered sinx function, but the substance of the approach

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
would be totally the same in any other application.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,240
It's kind of a weird question to think about though, isn't it, the average of a continuous

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
variable.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,280
Usually with averages we think of a finite number of variables, where you can add them

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,580
all up and divide that sum by how many there are.

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,240
But there are infinitely many values of sinx between 0 and pi, and it's not like we can

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
just add up all those numbers and divide by infinity.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,920
This sensation comes up a lot in math, and it's worth remembering, where you have this

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,480
vague sense that you want to add together infinitely many values associated with a continuum,

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,200
even though that doesn't make sense.

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,920
And almost always, when you get that sense, the key is to use an integral somehow.

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,340
And to think through exactly how, a good first step is to just approximate your situation

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,700
with some kind of finite sum.

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,060
In this case, imagine sampling a finite number of points evenly spaced along this range.

31
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,500
Since it's a finite sample, you can find the average by just adding up all the heights

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,740
sinx at each one of these, and then dividing that sum by the number of points you sampled.

33
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,460
And presumably, if the idea of an average height among all infinitely many points is

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,380
going to make any sense at all, the more points we sample, which would involve adding up more

35
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,740
and more heights, the closer the average of that sample should be to the actual average

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,420
of the continuous variable.

37
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,340
And this should feel at least somewhat related to taking an integral of sinx between 0 and

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,640
pi, even if it might not be exactly clear how the two ideas match up.

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,820
For that integral, remember, you also think of a sample of inputs on this continuum, but

40
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,020
instead of adding the height sinx at each one and dividing by how many there are, you

41
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,500
add up sinx times dx, where dx is the spacing between the samples.

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,420
That is, you're adding up little areas, not heights.

43
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,140
And technically, the integral is not quite this sum, it's whatever that sum approaches

44
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,820
as dx approaches 0, but it is actually quite helpful to reason with respect to one of these

45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,180
finite iterations, where we're looking at a concrete size for dx and some specific number

46
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,440
of rectangles.

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,360
So what you want to do here is reframe this expression for the average, this sum of the

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,100
heights divided by the number of sampled points, in terms of dx, the spacing between samples.

49
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,580
And now if I tell you that the spacing between these points is 0.1, and you know they range

50
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,280
from 0 to pi, can you tell me how many there are?

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,020
Well, you can take the length of that interval, pi, and divide it by the length of the space

52
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,420
between each sample.

53
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,720
If it doesn't go in perfectly evenly, you'd have to round down to the nearest integer,

54
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,300
but as an approximation, this is completely fine.

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,360
So if we write that spacing between samples as dx, the number of samples is pi divided

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,240
by dx.

57
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,780
And when we substitute that into our expression up here, you can rearrange it, putting that

58
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,820
dx up top and distributing it into the sum.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,180
But think about what it means to distribute that dx up top.

60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,760
It means that the terms you're adding up will look like sin of x times dx for the various

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,140
inputs x you're sampling.

62
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,060
So that numerator looks exactly like an integral expression.

63
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,500
And so for larger and larger samples of points, this average will approach the actual integral

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,020
of sin of x between 0 and pi, all divided by the length of that interval, pi.

65
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,160
In other words, the average height of this graph is this area divided by its width.

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,540
On an intuitive level, and just thinking in terms of units, that feels pretty reasonable,

67
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,700
doesn't it?

68
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,520
Area divided by width gives you an average height.

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,240
So with this expression in hand, let's actually solve it.

70
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,640
As we saw last video, to compute an integral, you need to find an antiderivative of the

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,280
function inside the integral, some other function whose derivative is sin of x.

72
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,600
And if you're comfortable with derivatives of trig functions, you know that the derivative

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,500
of cosine is negative sine.

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,400
So if you just negate that, negative cosine is the function we want, the antiderivative

75
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,860
of sine.

76
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,080
And to gut check yourself on that, look at this graph of negative cosine.

77
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,920
At 0, the slope is 0, and then it increases up to some maximum slope at pi halves, and

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,080
then goes back down to 0 at pi.

79
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,720
And in general, its slope does indeed seem to match the height of the sine graph at every

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,140
point.

81
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,500
So what do we have to do to evaluate the integral of sine between 0 and pi?

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,160
We evaluate this antiderivative at the upper bound, and subtract off its value at the lower

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
bound.

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,920
More visually, that's the difference in the height of this negative cosine graph above

85
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,280
pi and its height at 0.

86
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,320
And as you can see, that change in height is exactly 2.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,640
That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

88
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,760
That the area under this sine graph turns out to be exactly 2?

89
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,520
So the answer to our average height problem, this integral divided by the width of the

90
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,280
region, evidently turns out to be 2 divided by pi, which is around 0.64.

91
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,200
I promised at the start that this question of finding the average of a function offers

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,240
an alternate perspective on why integrals and derivatives are inverses of each other,

93
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,560
why the area under one graph has anything to do with the slope of another graph.

94
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Notice how finding this average value, 2 divided by pi, came down to looking at the change

95
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,560
in the antiderivative, negative cosine x, over the input range, divided by the length

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,920
of that range.

97
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,160
Another way to think about that fraction is as the rise over run slope between the point

98
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,800
of the antiderivative graph below 0 and the point of that graph above pi.

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
Think about why it might make sense that this slope would represent an average value of

100
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,500
sine of x on that region.

101
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,200
By definition, sine of x is the derivative of this antiderivative graph, giving us the

102
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,740
slope of negative cosine at every point.

103
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,580
So another way to think about the average value of sine of x is as the average slope

104
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,360
over all tangent lines between 0 and pi.

105
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,400
And when you view things like that, doesn't it make a lot of sense that the average slope

106
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,860
of a graph over all its points in a certain range should equal the total slope between

107
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,640
the start and end points?

108
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,400
To digest this idea, it helps to think about what it looks like for a general function.

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,080
For any function f of x, if you want to find its average value on some interval, say between

110
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,180
a and b, what you do is take the integral of f on that interval divided by the width

111
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,200
of that interval, b minus a.

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,420
You can think of this as the area under the graph divided by its width, or more accurately,

113
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:55,700
it is the signed area of that graph, since any area below the x-axis is counted as negative.

114
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,820
And it's worth taking a moment to remember what this area has to do with the usual notion

115
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,260
of a finite average, where you add up many numbers and divide by how many there are.

116
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,520
When you take some sample of points spaced out by dx, the number of samples is about

117
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,340
equal to the length of the interval divided by dx.

118
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,700
If you add up the values of f of x at each sample, and divide by the total number of

119
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,600
samples, it's the same as adding up the product f of x times dx, and dividing by the

120
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
width of the entire interval.

121
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,040
The only difference between that and the integral is that the integral asks what happens as

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,140
dx approaches 0, but that just corresponds with samples of more and more points that

123
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,600
approximate the true average increasingly well.

124
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,740
For any integral, evaluating it comes down to finding an antiderivative of f of x, commonly

125
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,040
denoted capital F of x.

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:59,040
What we want is the change to this antiderivative between a and b, capital F of b minus capital

127
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,680
F of a, which you can think of as the change in height of this new graph between the two

128
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,520
bounds.

129
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,800
I have conveniently chosen an antiderivative that passes through 0 at the lower bound here,

130
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,660
but keep in mind you can freely shift this up and down adding whatever constant you want

131
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,480
to it, and it would still be a valid antiderivative.

132
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,920
The solution to the average problem is the change in the height of this new graph divided

133
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:34,200
by the change to the x value between a and b, in other words the slope of the antiderivative

134
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,760
graph between the two endpoints.

135
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
And again, when you stop to think about it, that should make a lot of sense, because little

136
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,000
f of x gives us the slope of the tangent line to this graph at each point.

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,080
After all, it is by definition the derivative of capital F.

138
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,920
So why are antiderivatives the key to solving integrals?

139
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,280
My favorite intuition is still the one I showed last video, but a second perspective is that

140
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,800
when you reframe the question of finding an average of a continuous value as instead

141
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,200
finding the average slope of a bunch of tangent lines, it lets you see the answer just by

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:23,360
comparing endpoints, rather than having to actually tally up all the points in between.

143
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,640
In the last video I described a sensation that should bring integrals to your mind,

144
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,660
namely if you feel like the problem you're solving could be approximated by breaking

145
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,380
it up somehow and adding up a large number of small things.

146
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,700
And here I want you to come away recognizing a second sensation that should also bring

147
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,820
integrals to your mind.

148
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,220
If ever there's some idea that you understand in a finite context, and which involves adding

149
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,260
up multiple values, like taking the average of a bunch of numbers, and if you want to

150
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,300
generalize that idea to apply to an infinite continuous range of values, try seeing if

151
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,540
you can phrase things in terms of an integral.

152
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a feeling that comes up all the time, especially in probability, and it's definitely

153
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,080
worth remembering.

154
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
My thanks, as always, go to those making these videos possible.
