00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,800
Here, I want to discuss one common type of problem where integration comes up, 

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,500
finding the average of a continuous variable.

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,297
This is a perfectly useful thing to know in its own right, 

4
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:29,427
but what's really neat is that it can give us a completely different 

5
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:32,740
perspective for why integrals and derivatives are inverses of each other.

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,540
To start, take a look at the graph of sinx between 0 and pi, which is half of its period.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,800
What is the average height of this graph on that interval?

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,120
It's not a useless question.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,380
All sorts of cyclic phenomena in the world are modeled using sine waves.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,349
For example, the number of hours the sun is up per day as a 

11
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:58,180
function of what day of the year it is follows a sine wave pattern.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,900
So if you wanted to predict the average effectiveness of solar panels in summer months vs.

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,319
winter months, you'd want to be able to answer a question like this, 

14
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,660
what is the average value of that sine function over half of its period?

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,248
Where as a case like this is going to have all sorts of constants mucking up the 

16
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:22,455
function, you and I are going to focus on a pure, unencumbered sinx function, 

17
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:27,040
but the substance of the approach would be totally the same in any other application.

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,020
It's kind of a weird question to think about though, isn't it?

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,320
The average of a continuous variable.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,595
Usually with averages we think of a finite number of variables, 

21
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:41,820
where you can add them all up and divide that sum by how many there are.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,221
But there are infinitely many values of sinx between 0 and pi, 

23
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:53,200
and it's not like we can just add up all those numbers and divide by infinity.

24
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,215
This sensation comes up a lot in math, and it's worth remembering, 

25
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:02,656
where you have this vague sense that you want to add together infinitely 

26
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:07,340
many values associated with a continuum, even though that doesn't make sense.

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,200
And almost always, when you get that sense, the key is to use an integral somehow.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,222
And to think through exactly how, a good first step is to 

29
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:20,780
just approximate your situation with some kind of finite sum.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,060
In this case, imagine sampling a finite number of points evenly spaced along this range.

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,835
Since it's a finite sample, you can find the average by just adding up all the heights 

32
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:37,920
sinx at each one of these, and then dividing that sum by the number of points you sampled.

33
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,595
And presumably, if the idea of an average height among all infinitely many 

34
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:47,528
points is going to make any sense at all, the more points we sample, 

35
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:50,550
which would involve adding up more and more heights, 

36
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,711
the closer the average of that sample should be to the actual average of 

37
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,080
the continuous variable.

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,799
And this should feel at least somewhat related to taking an integral of sinx 

39
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,800
between 0 and pi, even if it might not be exactly clear how the two ideas match up.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,103
For that integral, remember, you also think of a sample of inputs on this continuum, 

41
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:18,812
but instead of adding the height sinx at each one and dividing by how many there are, 

42
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:23,460
you add up sinx times dx, where dx is the spacing between the samples.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
That is, you're adding up little areas, not heights.

44
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,550
And technically, the integral is not quite this sum, 

45
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,800
it's whatever that sum approaches as dx approaches 0.

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,764
But it is actually quite helpful to reason with respect to one of these finite 

47
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:44,406
iterations, where we're looking at a concrete size for dx and some specific number of 

48
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:45,000
rectangles.

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,526
So what you want to do here is reframe this expression for the average, 

50
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:54,649
this sum of the heights divided by the number of sampled points, 

51
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:57,440
in terms of dx, the spacing between samples.

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,118
And now, if I tell you that the spacing between these points is, say, 0.1, 

53
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:09,400
and you know that they range from 0 to pi, can you tell me how many there are?

54
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,431
Well, you can take the length of that interval, pi, 

55
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:18,339
and divide it by the length of the space between each sample.

56
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,812
If it doesn't go in perfectly evenly, you'd have to round down to the nearest integer, 

57
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:26,320
but as an approximation, this is completely fine.

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,023
So if we write that spacing between samples as dx, 

59
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:34,140
the number of samples is pi divided by dx.

60
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,018
And when we substitute that into our expression up here, 

61
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:42,560
you can rearrange it, putting that dx up top and distributing it into the sum.

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,140
But think about what it means to distribute that dx up top.

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,586
It means that the terms you're adding up will look like 

64
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:55,300
sinx times dx for the various inputs x that you're sampling.

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,080
So that numerator looks exactly like an integral expression.

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,945
And so for larger and larger samples of points, 

67
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:07,699
this average will approach the actual integral of sinx between 0 and pi, 

68
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,760
all divided by the length of that interval, pi.

69
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,140
In other words, the average height of this graph is this area divided by its width.

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,038
On an intuitive level, and just thinking in terms of units, 

71
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,060
that feels pretty reasonable, doesn't it?

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,040
Area divided by width gives you an average height.

73
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,400
So with this expression in hand, let's actually solve it.

74
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,069
As we saw last video, to compute an integral, you need to find an antiderivative 

75
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,020
of the function inside the integral, some other function whose derivative is sinx.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,551
And if you're comfortable with derivatives of trig functions, 

77
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,760
you know that the derivative of cosine is negative sine.

78
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,450
So if you just negate that, negative cosine is the function we want, 

79
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,020
the antiderivative of sine.

80
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,620
And to gut-check yourself on that, look at this graph of negative cosine.

81
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,336
At 0, the slope is 0, and then it increases up to some maximum slope at pi halves, 

82
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:09,000
and then goes back down to 0 at pi.

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,735
And in general, its slope does indeed seem to 

84
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,840
match the height of the sine graph at every point.

85
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,120
So what do we have to do to evaluate the integral of sine between 0 and pi?

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,571
We evaluate this antiderivative at the upper bound, 

87
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:28,660
and subtract off its value at the lower bound.

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,839
More visually, that's the difference in the height of 

89
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,240
this negative cosine graph above pi and its height at 0.

90
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,780
And as you can see, that change in height is exactly 2.

91
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,400
That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

92
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,460
That the area under this sine graph turns out to be exactly 2?

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,845
So the answer to our average height problem, this integral divided by the width 

94
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:59,400
of the region, evidently turns out to be 2 divided by pi, which is around 0.64.

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,341
I promised at the start that this question of finding the average of a function offers 

96
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:11,324
an alternate perspective on why integrals and derivatives are inverses of each other, 

97
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:15,960
why the area under one graph has anything to do with the slope of another graph.

98
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,662
Notice how finding this average value, 2 divided by pi, 

99
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:24,476
came down to looking at the change in the antiderivative, 

100
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:29,540
negative cosine x, over the input range, divided by the length of that range.

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,820
And another way to think about that fraction is as the rise over run slope between 

102
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,040
the point of the antiderivative graph below 0 and the point of that graph above pi.

103
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,553
Think about why it might make sense that this slope would 

104
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,980
represent an average value of sine of x on that region.

105
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,299
By definition, sine of x is the derivative of this antiderivative graph, 

106
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:58,880
giving us the slope of negative cosine at every point.

107
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,880
Another way to think about the average value of sine of x is 

108
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,000
as the average slope over all tangent lines between 0 and pi.

109
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,621
And when you view things like that, doesn't it make a lot of sense 

110
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:16,342
that the average slope of a graph over all its points in a certain 

111
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:20,120
range should equal the total slope between the start and end points?

112
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,520
To digest this idea, it helps to think about what it looks like for a general function.

113
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,010
For any function f of x, if you want to find its average value on some interval, 

114
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,577
say between a and b, you take the integral of f on that interval 

115
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:42,020
divided by the width of that interval, b minus a.

116
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,321
You can think of this as the area under the graph divided by its width, 

117
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,679
or more accurately, it is the signed area of that graph, 

118
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,920
since any area below the x-axis is counted as negative.

119
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,155
And it's worth taking a moment to remember what this area has to do with the usual notion 

120
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:04,500
of a finite average, where you add up many numbers and divide by how many there are.

121
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,332
When you take some sample of points spaced out by dx, 

122
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:13,240
the number of samples is about equal to the length of the interval divided by dx.

123
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,595
So if you add up the values of f of x at each sample and divide by 

124
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:23,035
the total number of samples, it's the same as adding up the product 

125
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:27,280
f of x times dx and dividing by the width of the entire interval.

126
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,269
The only difference between that and the integral is that the integral asks 

127
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,562
what happens as dx approaches 0, but that just corresponds with samples of 

128
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:40,740
more and more points that approximate the true average increasingly well.

129
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,366
Now for any integral, evaluating it comes down to finding an antiderivative of f of x, 

130
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,620
commonly denoted capital F of x.

131
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,315
What we want is the change to this antiderivative between a and b, 

132
00:09:56,315 --> 00:10:00,843
capital F of b minus capital F of a, which you can think of as 

133
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:05,300
the change in height of this new graph between the two bounds.

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,959
I've conveniently chosen an antiderivative that passes through 0 at the lower bound here, 

135
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,220
but keep in mind you can freely shift this up and down adding whatever 

136
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,000
constant you want and it would still be a valid antiderivative.

137
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,986
So the solution to the average problem is the change in the height of 

138
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:30,520
this new graph divided by the change to the x value between a and b.

139
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,140
In other words, it is the slope of the antiderivative graph between the two endpoints.

140
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,604
And again, when you stop to think about it, that should make a lot of sense, 

141
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:46,380
because little gives us the slope of the tangent line to this graph at each point.

142
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,060
After all, it is by definition the derivative of capital F.

143
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,500
So why are antiderivatives the key to solving integrals?

144
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,373
My favorite intuition is still the one I showed last video, 

145
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:06,720
but a second perspective is that when you reframe the question of finding an average 

146
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,255
of a continuous value as instead finding the average slope of a bunch of tangent lines, 

147
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,664
it lets you see the answer just by comparing endpoints rather than having to tally up 

148
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:19,300
all the points in between.

149
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,658
In the last video I described a sensation that should bring integrals to your mind, 

150
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:31,765
namely if you feel like the problem you're solving could be approximated by 

151
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:35,440
breaking it up somehow and adding up a large number of small things.

152
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,835
Here I want you to come away recognizing a second 

153
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:41,900
sensation that should also bring integrals to your mind.

154
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,878
If ever there's some idea that you understand in a finite context, 

155
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:51,354
and which involves adding up multiple values, like taking the average of a 

156
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:56,248
bunch of numbers, and if you want to generalize that idea to apply to an infinite 

157
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:01,500
continuous range of values, try seeing if you can phrase things in terms of an integral.

158
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,795
It's a feeling that comes up all the time, especially in probability, 

159
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,780
and it's definitely worth remembering.
