00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,460
In the next chapter about Taylor series, I make frequent reference to higher order derivatives.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,640
And if you're already comfortable with second derivatives, third derivatives, and so on,

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:13,980
great!

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,660
Feel free to just skip ahead to the main event now.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,800
You won't hurt my feelings.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,480
But somehow, I've managed not to bring up higher order derivatives at all so far in

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,020
this series.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,880
So for the sake of completeness, I thought I'd give you this little footnote just to

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,080
go over them very quickly.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,480
I'll focus mainly on the second derivative, showing what it looks like in the context

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,560
of graphs and motion, and leave you to think about the analogies for higher orders.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,720
Given some function f of x, the derivative can be interpreted as the slope of this graph

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,180
above some point, right?

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,460
A steep slope means a high value for the derivative, a downward slope means a negative derivative.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,940
So the second derivative, whose notation I'll explain in just a moment, is the derivative

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,260
of the derivative, meaning it tells you how that slope is changing.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,460
The way to see that at a glance is to think about how the graph of f of x curves.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,120
At points where it curves upwards, the slope is increasing, and that means the second derivative

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,200
is positive.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,320
At points where it's curving downwards, the slope is decreasing, so the second derivative

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,060
is negative.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,440
For example, a graph like this one has a very positive second derivative at the point 4,

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,900
since the slope is rapidly increasing around that point, whereas a graph like this one

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,200
still has a positive second derivative at the same point, but it's smaller, the slope

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,640
only increases slowly.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,900
At points where there's not really any curvature, the second derivative is just 0.

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,380
As far as notation goes, you could try writing it like this, indicating some small change

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,160
to the derivative function, divided by some small change to x, where, as always, the use

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,080
of this letter d suggests that what you really want to consider is what this ratio approaches

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,440
as dx approaches 0.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,160
That's pretty awkward and clunky, so the standard is to abbreviate this as d2f divided

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,180
by dx2.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,580
And even though it's not terribly important for getting an intuition for the second derivative,

34
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,500
I think it might be worth showing you how you can read this notation.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,140
To start off, think of some input to your function, and then take two small steps to

36
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,860
the right, each one with a size of dx.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm choosing rather big steps here so we'll be able to see what's going on, but in principle

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
keep in the back of your mind that dx should be rather tiny.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,900
The first step causes some change to the function, which I'll call df1, and the second step

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,480
causes some similar but possibly slightly different change, which I'll call df2.

41
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,820
The difference between these changes, the change in how the function changes, is what

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,660
we'll call ddf.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,460
You should think of this as really small, typically proportional to the size of dx2.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,040
So if, for example, you substituted in 0.01 for dx, you would expect this ddf to be about

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,600
proportional to 0.0001.

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,380
The second derivative is the size of this change to the change, divided by the size

47
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,640
of dx2, or more precisely, whatever that ratio approaches as dx approaches 0.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,780
Even though it's not like this letter d is a variable being multiplied by f, for the

49
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,740
sake of more compact notation you'd write it as d2f divided by dx2, and you don't

50
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,780
bother with any parentheses on the bottom.

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,240
Maybe the most visceral understanding of the second derivative is that it represents acceleration.

52
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,000
Given some movement along a line, suppose you have some function that records the distance

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,380
traveled versus time, maybe its graph looks something like this, steadily increasing over

54
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,820
time.

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,320
Then its derivative tells you velocity at each point in time, for example the graph

56
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,300
might look like this bump, increasing up to some maximum, and decreasing back to zero.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,580
So the second derivative tells you the rate of change for the velocity, which is the acceleration

58
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,900
at each point in time.

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,740
In this example, the second derivative is positive for the first half of the journey,

60
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,440
which indicates speeding up, that's the sensation of being pushed back into your car

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,820
seat, or rather, having the car seat push you forward.

62
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,520
A negative second derivative indicates slowing down, negative acceleration.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,080
The third derivative, and this is not a joke, is called jerk.

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,920
So if the jerk is not zero, it means the strength of the acceleration itself is changing.

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,660
One of the most useful things about higher order derivatives is how they help us in approximating

66
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,540
functions, which is exactly the topic of the next chapter on Taylor series, so I'll see

67
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,980
you there.
