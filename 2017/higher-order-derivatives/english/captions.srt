00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,768
In the next chapter about Taylor series, I make 

2
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:09,460
frequent reference to higher order derivatives.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,509
And if you're already comfortable with second derivatives, 

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,980
third derivatives, and so on, great!

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,660
Feel free to just skip ahead to the main event now.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,800
You won't hurt my feelings.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,542
But somehow, I've managed not to bring up higher 

8
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,020
order derivatives at all so far in this series.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,820
So for the sake of completeness, I thought I'd give you 

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,080
this little footnote just to go over them very quickly.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,179
I'll focus mainly on the second derivative, showing what it looks like in the context 

12
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,560
of graphs and motion, and leave you to think about the analogies for higher orders.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,232
Given some function f of x, the derivative can be 

14
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:47,180
interpreted as the slope of this graph above some point, right?

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,301
A steep slope means a high value for the derivative, 

16
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,460
a downward slope means a negative derivative.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,376
So the second derivative, whose notation I'll explain in just a moment, 

18
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:02,260
is the derivative of the derivative, meaning it tells you how that slope is changing.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,460
The way to see that at a glance is to think about how the graph of f of x curves.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,026
At points where it curves upwards, the slope is increasing, 

21
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:15,200
and that means the second derivative is positive.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,151
At points where it's curving downwards, the slope is decreasing, 

23
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:23,060
so the second derivative is negative.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,154
For example, a graph like this one has a very positive second derivative at the point 4, 

25
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:36,096
since the slope is rapidly increasing around that point, 

26
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:42,182
whereas a graph like this one still has a positive second derivative at the same point, 

27
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:45,640
but it's smaller, the slope only increases slowly.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,900
At points where there's not really any curvature, the second derivative is just 0.

29
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,779
As far as notation goes, you could try writing it like this, 

30
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:01,890
indicating some small change to the derivative function, 

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,713
divided by some small change to x, where, as always, 

32
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:10,905
the use of this letter d suggests that what you really want to consider 

33
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:14,440
is what this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0.

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,603
That's pretty awkward and clunky, so the standard 

35
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:23,180
is to abbreviate this as d2f divided by dx2.

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,504
And even though it's not terribly important for getting an intuition for the second 

37
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:32,500
derivative, I think it might be worth showing you how you can read this notation.

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,415
To start off, think of some input to your function, 

39
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:40,860
and then take two small steps to the right, each one with a size of dx.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,814
I'm choosing rather big steps here so we'll be able to see what's going on, 

41
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:49,680
but in principle keep in the back of your mind that dx should be rather tiny.

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,747
The first step causes some change to the function, which I'll call df1, 

43
00:02:55,747 --> 00:03:01,133
and the second step causes some similar but possibly slightly different change, 

44
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,480
which I'll call df2.

45
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,990
The difference between these changes, the change in how the function changes, 

46
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,660
is what we'll call ddf.

47
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,460
You should think of this as really small, typically proportional to the size of dx2.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,093
So if, for example, you substituted in 0.01 for dx, 

49
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:28,600
you would expect this ddf to be about proportional to 0.0001.

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,446
The second derivative is the size of this change to the change, 

51
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:37,931
divided by the size of dx2, or more precisely, 

52
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,640
whatever that ratio approaches as dx approaches 0.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,445
Even though it's not like this letter d is a variable being multiplied by f, 

54
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:53,819
for the sake of more compact notation you'd write it as d2f divided by dx2, 

55
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,780
and you don't bother with any parentheses on the bottom.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,799
Maybe the most visceral understanding of the second 

57
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,240
derivative is that it represents acceleration.

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,898
Given some movement along a line, suppose you have some function 

59
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:11,644
that records the distance traveled versus time, 

60
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:15,820
maybe its graph looks something like this, steadily increasing over time.

61
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,226
Then its derivative tells you velocity at each point in time, 

62
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:24,725
for example the graph might look like this bump, increasing up to some maximum, 

63
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,300
and decreasing back to zero.

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,219
So the second derivative tells you the rate of change for the velocity, 

65
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,900
which is the acceleration at each point in time.

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,468
In this example, the second derivative is positive for the first half of the journey, 

67
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:43,488
which indicates speeding up, that's the sensation of being pushed back into 

68
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:46,820
your car seat, or rather, having the car seat push you forward.

69
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,520
A negative second derivative indicates slowing down, negative acceleration.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,080
The third derivative, and this is not a joke, is called jerk.

71
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,920
So if the jerk is not zero, it means the strength of the acceleration itself is changing.

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,656
One of the most useful things about higher order derivatives is 

73
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:13,138
how they help us in approximating functions, which is exactly the 

74
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:16,620
topic of the next chapter on Taylor series, so I'll see you there.
