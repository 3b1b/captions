00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:10,120
In the next chapter about Taylor series, I make frequent reference to higher order derivatives.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,880
And if you're already comfortable with second derivatives, third derivatives, and so on,

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,880
great!

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,920
Feel free to just skip ahead to the main event now.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,040
You won't hurt my feelings.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,400
But somehow, I've managed not to bring up higher order derivatives at all so far in

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,600
this series.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,780
So for the sake of completeness, I thought I'd give you this little footnote just to

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,360
go over them very quickly.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,520
I'll focus mainly on the second derivative, showing what it looks like in the context

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,080
of graphs and motion, and leave you to think about the analogies for higher orders.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,800
Given some function f of x, the derivative can be interpreted as the slope of this graph

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,720
above some point, right?

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,340
A steep slope means a high value for the derivative, a downward slope means a negative derivative.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,080
So the second derivative, whose notation I'll explain in just a moment, is the derivative

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,280
of the derivative, meaning it tells you how that slope is changing.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,260
The way to see that at a glance is to think about how the graph of f of x curves.

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:14,400
At points where it curves upwards, the slope is increasing, and that means the second derivative

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
is positive.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,520
At points where it's curving downwards, the slope is decreasing, so the second derivative

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,640
is negative.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,140
For example, a graph like this one has a very positive second derivative at the point 4,

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,140
since the slope is rapidly increasing around that point, whereas a graph like this one

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,180
still has a positive second derivative at the same point, but it's smaller, the slope

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,800
only increases slowly.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,660
At points where there's not really any curvature, the second derivative is just 0.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,380
As far as notation goes, you could try writing it like this, indicating some small change

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,140
to the derivative function, divided by some small change to x, where as always the use

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,500
of this letter d suggests that what you really want to consider is what this ratio approaches

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,980
as dx, both dx's in this case, approach 0.

31
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,220
That's pretty awkward and clunky, so the standard is to abbreviate this as d squared

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,460
f divided by dx squared.

33
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,660
And even though it's not terribly important for getting an intuition for the second derivative,

34
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,220
I think it might be worth showing you how you can read this notation.

35
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,080
To start off, think of some input to your function, and then take two small steps to

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,340
the right, each one with a size of dx.

37
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,820
I'm choosing rather big steps here so we'll be able to see what's going on, but in principle

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,000
keep in the back of your mind that dx should be rather tiny.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,840
The first step causes some change to the function, which I'll call df1, and the second step

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,600
causes some similar but possibly slightly different change, which I'll call df2.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,800
The difference between these changes, the change in how the function changes, is what

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,160
we'll call ddf.

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,480
You should think of this as really small, typically proportional to the size of dx squared,

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,680
so if you substituted in 0.01 for dx, you would expect this ddf to be about proportional

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,640
to 0.0001, and the second derivative is the size of this change to the change divided

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,320
by the size of dx squared, or more precisely, whatever that ratio approaches as dx approaches

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,480
0.

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,680
Even though it's not like this letter d is a variable being multiplied by f, for the

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,640
sake of more compact notation you'd write it as d2f divided by dx2, and you don't

50
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,400
typically bother with any parentheses on the bottom.

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,320
Maybe the most visceral understanding of the second derivative is that it represents acceleration.

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,000
Given some movement along a line, suppose you have some function that records the distance

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,800
traveled versus time, maybe its graph looks like this, steadily increasing over time.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,280
Then its derivative tells you velocity at each point in time, for example the graph

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,280
might look like this bump, increasing up to some maximum, and decreasing back to zero.

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,800
So the second derivative tells you the rate of change for the velocity, which is the acceleration

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,980
at each point in time.

58
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,200
In this example, the second derivative is positive for the first half of the journey,

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,360
which indicates speeding up, that's the sensation of being pushed back into your car

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
seat, or rather, having the car seat push you forward.

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,000
A negative second derivative indicates slowing down, negative acceleration.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,860
The third derivative, and this is not a joke, is called jerk.

63
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,440
So if the jerk is not zero, it means that the strength of the acceleration itself is

64
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,340
changing.

65
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,100
One of the most useful things about higher order derivatives is how they help us in approximating

66
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,500
functions, which is exactly the topic of the next chapter on Taylor series, so I'll see

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,000
you there.

68
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,420
you
