  "input": "Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average.  This depends on the thing being attempted.  If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.  Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?",
  "translatedText": "有几个人评论说 2^256 是最大尝试次数，而不是平均值。这取决于正在尝试的事情。如果它猜测私钥，那么您是正确的，但是对于猜测哈希函数的哪个输入给出所需的输出（例如，在比特币挖掘中）之类的事情，这就是我在这里想到的事情，2^ 256 确实是所需的平均尝试次数，至少对于真正的加密哈希函数来说是这样。想象一下掷骰子直到得到 6，平均需要掷多少次？",
