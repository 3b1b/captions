00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Let me share with you something I found particularly weird when I was a student first learning

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,520
calculus. Let's say you have a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin of the xy

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,240
plane. This is something defined with the equation x2 plus y2 equals 5 squared, that

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,880
is, all the points on the circle are a distance 5 from the origin as encapsulated by the Pythagorean

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,800
theorem, where the sum of the squares of the two legs on this triangle equals the square

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,360
of the hypotenuse, 5 squared. And suppose you want to find the slope of a tangent line

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,160
to the circle, maybe at the point xy equals 3,4. Now if you're savvy with geometry,

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,900
you might already know that this tangent line is perpendicular to the radius touching it

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,900
at that point. But let's say you don't already know that, or maybe you want a technique

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,120
that generalizes to curves other than just circles. As with other problems about the

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,180
slopes of tangent lines to curves, the key thought here is to zoom in close enough that

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,260
the curve basically looks just like its own tangent line, and then ask about a tiny step

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,900
along that curve. The y component of that little step is what you might call dy, and

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,660
the x component is dx, so the slope we want is the rise over run, dy divided by dx. But

15
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,860
unlike other tangent slope problems in calculus, this curve is not the graph of a function,

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,620
so we can't just take a simple derivative, asking about the size of some tiny nudge to

17
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:46,020
the output of a function caused by some tiny nudge to the input. x is not an input, and

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,860
y is not an output, they're both just interdependent values related by some equation. This is what's

19
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,540
called an implicit curve, it's just the set of all points x, y that satisfy some property

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,940
written in terms of the two variables, x and y. The procedure for how you actually find

21
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,820
dy, dx for curves like this is the thing I found very weird as a calculus student. You

22
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:20,020
take the derivative of both sides like this, for x squared you write 2x times dx, and similarly

23
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:26,540
y squared becomes 2y times dy, and then the derivative of that constant 5 squared on the

24
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,000
right is just 0. Now you can see why this feels a little strange, right? What does it

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,520
mean to take the derivative of an expression that has multiple variables in it, and why

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,760
is it that we're tacking on dy and dx in this way? But if you just blindly move forward

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,200
with what you get, you can rearrange this equation and find an expression for dy divided

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,760
by dx, which in this case comes out to be negative x divided by y. So at the point with

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,720
coordinates x, y equals 3, 4, that slope would be negative 3 divided by 4, evidently. This

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,400
strange process is called implicit differentiation, and don't worry, I have an explanation

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,740
for how you can interpret taking a derivative of an expression with two variables like this.

32
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,360
But first I want to set aside this particular problem and show how it's connected to a

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,080
different type of calculus problem, something called a related rates problem. Imagine a

34
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,420
5 meter long ladder held up against a wall where the top of the ladder starts 4 meters

35
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,700
above the ground, which by the Pythagorean theorem means that the bottom is 3 meters

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,500
away from the wall. And let's say it's slipping down in such a way that the top of

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,740
the ladder is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second. The question is, in that initial

38
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,300
moment, what's the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall?

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:01,140
It's interesting, right? That distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall is 100%

40
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,180
determined by the distance from the top of the ladder to the floor. So we should have

41
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,480
enough information to figure out how the rates of change for each of those values actually

42
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,580
depend on each other, but it might not be entirely clear how exactly you relate those

43
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,460
two. First things first, it's always nice to give names to the quantities we care about,

44
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,600
so let's label that distance from the top of the ladder to the ground y of t, written

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,940
as a function of time because it's changing. Likewise, label the distance between the bottom

46
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,960
of the ladder and the wall x of t. The key equation that relates these terms is the Pythagorean

47
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,200
theorem x of t squared plus y of t squared equals 5 squared. What makes that a powerful

48
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,600
equation to use is that it's true at all points of time. Now one way that you could

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,840
solve this would be to isolate x of t, and then you figure out what y of t has to be

50
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,520
based on that 1 m per second drop rate, and you could take the derivative of the resulting

51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,640
function dx dt, the rate at which x is changing with respect to time. And that's fine, it

52
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,240
involves a couple layers of using the chain rule, and it'll definitely work for you,

53
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,000
but I want to show a different way that you can think about the same problem. This left

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,840
hand side of the equation is a function of time, right? It just so happens to equal a

55
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,360
constant, meaning the value evidently doesn't change while time passes, but it's still written

56
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,800
as an expression dependent on time, which means we can manipulate it like any other function that

57
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,720
has t as an input. In particular, we can take a derivative of this left hand side, which is a

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,320
way of saying, if I let a little bit of time pass, some small dt, which causes y to slightly decrease,

59
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,520
and x to slightly increase, how much does this expression change? On the one hand, we know that

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,320
that derivative should be 0, since the expression is a constant, and constants don't care about

61
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,880
your tiny nudges in time, they just remain unchanged. But on the other hand, what do you get

62
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,160
when you compute this derivative? Well, the derivative of x of t squared is 2 times x of t

63
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,480
times the derivative of x. That's the chain rule that I talked about last video. 2x dx represents

64
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,480
the size of a change to x squared caused by some change to x, and then we're dividing out by dt.

65
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:34,840
Likewise, the rate at which y of t squared is changing is 2 times y of t times the derivative of y.

66
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,440
Now, evidently, this whole expression must be 0, and that's an equivalent way of saying that x squared

67
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,440
plus y squared must not change while the ladder moves. At the very start, time t equals 0,

68
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,800
the height, y of t, is 4 meters, and that distance x of t is 3 meters. And since the top of the ladder

69
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,800
is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second, that derivative, dy dt, is negative 1 meters per second.

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,440
Now, this gives us enough information to isolate the derivative, dx dt, and when you work it out,

71
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,960
it comes out to be 4 thirds meters per second. The reason I bring up this ladder problem is that I want you

72
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,520
to compare it to the problem of finding the slope of a tangent line to the circle. In both cases, we had

73
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,680
the equation x squared plus y squared equals 5 squared, and in both cases, we ended up taking the derivative

74
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,920
of each side of this expression. But for the ladder question, these expressions were functions of time,

75
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,960
so taking the derivative has a clear meaning. It's the rate at which the expression changes as time changes.

76
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,440
But what makes the circle situation strange is that rather than saying that a small amount of time dt has passed,

77
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,960
which causes x and y to change, the derivative just has these tiny nudges, dx and dy, just floating free,

78
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,280
not tied to some other common variable, like time. Let me show you a nice way to think about this.

79
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Let's give this expression x squared plus y squared a name, maybe s. s is essentially a function of two variables.

80
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,640
It takes every point xy on the plane and associates it with a number. For points on the circle, that number

81
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,640
happens to be 25. If you stepped off the circle away from the center, that value would be bigger.

82
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:32,080
For other points xy closer to the origin, that value would be smaller. Now what it means to take a derivative

83
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,720
of this expression, a derivative of s, is to consider a tiny change to both of these variables,

84
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:46,240
some tiny change dx to x, and some tiny change dy to y, and not necessarily one that keeps you on the circle,

85
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,640
by the way, it's just any tiny step in any direction of the xy plane. And from there you ask,

86
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,760
how much does the value of s change? And that difference, the difference in the value of s before the nudge

87
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,600
and after the nudge, is what I'm writing as ds. For example, in this picture we're starting off at a point

88
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:17,040
where x equals 3 and where y equals 4, and let's just say that that step I drew has dx at negative 0.02

89
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:25,600
and dy at negative 0.01. Then the decrease in s, the amount that x squared plus y squared changes

90
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:34,720
over that step, would be about 2 times 3 times negative 0.02 plus 2 times 4 times negative 0.01.

91
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,720
That's what this derivative expression, 2x dx plus 2y dy, actually means. It's a recipe for telling you

92
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,880
how much the value x squared plus y squared changes as determined by the point xy where you start

93
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,880
and the tiny step dx dy that you take. And as with all things derivative, this is only an approximation,

94
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,440
but it's one that gets truer and truer for smaller and smaller choices of dx and dy.

95
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,600
The key point here is that when you restrict yourself to steps along the circle, you're

96
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,360
essentially saying you want to ensure that this value of s doesn't change. It starts at a value

97
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:21,280
of 25 and you want to keep it at a value of 25. That is, ds should be 0. So setting the expression

98
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:29,200
2x dx plus 2y dy equal to 0 is the condition under which one of these tiny steps actually stays on the

99
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,400
circle. Again, this is only an approximation. Speaking more precisely, that condition is what keeps you on

100
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,400
the tangent line of the circle, not the circle itself. But for tiny enough steps, those are

101
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,480
essentially the same thing. Of course, there's nothing special about the expression x squared plus y

102
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,520
squared equals 5 squared. It's always nice to think through more examples, so let's consider this

103
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,800
expression sine of x times y squared equals x. This corresponds to a whole bunch of u-shaped curves

104
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,240
on the plane. And those curves, remember, represent all of the points xy where the value of sine of x

105
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:18,960
times y squared happens to equal the value of x. Now imagine taking some tiny step with components

106
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,600
dx dy and not necessarily one that keeps you on the curve. Taking the derivative of each side of

107
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,480
this equation is going to tell us how much the value of that side changes during the step. On the

108
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
left side, the product rule that we talked through last video tells us that this should be left d

109
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,480
right plus right d left. That is sine of x times the change to y squared, which is 2y times dy,

110
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,800
plus y squared times the change to sine of x, which is cosine of x times dx. The right side

111
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,800
is simply x, so the size of a change to that value is exactly dx, right? Now setting these two sides

112
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,560
equal to each other is a way of saying whatever your tiny step with coordinates dx and dy is,

113
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,040
if it's going to keep us on the curve, the values of both the left hand side and the right hand side

114
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,640
must change by the same amount. That's the only way that this top equation can remain true.

115
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,560
From there, depending on what problem you're trying to solve, you have something to work with

116
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,480
algebraically, and maybe the most common goal is to try to figure out what dy divided by dx is.

117
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,080
As a final example here, I want to show you how you can actually use this technique of implicit

118
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,840
differentiation to figure out new derivative formulas. I've mentioned that the derivative

119
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,360
of e to the x is itself, but what about the derivative of its inverse function, the natural

120
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,240
log of x? Well the graph of the natural log of x can be thought of as an implicit curve. It's all

121
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,880
of the points x, y on the plane where y happens to equal ln of x. It just happens to be the case

122
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,080
that the x's and the y's of this equation aren't as intermingled as they were in our other examples.

123
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,280
The slope of this graph, dy divided by dx, should be the derivative of ln of x, right?

124
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:24,640
Well to find that, first rearrange this equation y equals ln of x to be e to the y equals x. This

125
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,480
is exactly what the natural log of x means, it's saying e to the what equals x. Since we know the

126
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,480
derivative of e to the y, we can take the derivative of both sides here, effectively asking how a tiny

127
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,600
step with components dx dy changes the value of each one of these sides. To ensure that a step

128
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,840
stays on the curve, the change to this left side of the equation, which is e to the y times dy,

129
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,600
must equal the change to the right side, which in this case is just dx. Rearranging, that means that

130
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:08,000
dy divided by dx, the slope of our graph, equals 1 divided by e to the y. And when we're on the curve,

131
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,480
e to the y is by definition the same thing as x, so evidently this slope is 1 divided by x.

132
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,160
And of course an expression for the slope of a graph of a function written in terms of x like

133
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,120
this is the derivative of that function, so evidently the derivative of ln of x is 1 divided by x.

134
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,480
By the way, all of this is a little sneak peek into multivariable calculus, where you consider

135
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,360
functions that have multiple inputs and how they change as you tweak those multiple inputs. The key,

136
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,760
as always, is to have a clear image in your head of what tiny nudges are at play and how exactly

137
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,000
they depend on each other. Next up I'm going to be talking about limits and how they're used to

138
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,880
formalize the idea of a derivative.
