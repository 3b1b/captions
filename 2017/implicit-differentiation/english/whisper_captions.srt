00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,440
Let me share with you something I found particularly weird when I was a student first learning

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,100
calculus. Let's say you have a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin of the xy

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,240
plane. This is something defined with the equation x2 plus y2 equals 5 squared, that

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,880
is, all the points on the circle are a distance 5 from the origin as encapsulated by the Pythagorean

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,780
theorem, where the sum of the squares of the two legs on this triangle equals the square

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,400
of the hypotenuse, 5 squared. And suppose you want to find the slope of a tangent line

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,680
to the circle, maybe at the point xy equals 3,4. Now if you're savvy with geometry,

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,880
you might already know that this tangent line is perpendicular to the radius touching it

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,860
at that point. But let's say you don't already know that, or maybe you want a technique

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,260
that generalizes to curves other than just circles. As with other problems about the

11
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,220
slopes of tangent lines to curves, the key thought here is to zoom in close enough that

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,300
the curve basically looks just like its own tangent line, and then ask about a tiny step

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,900
along that curve. The y component of that little step is what you might call dy, and

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,600
the x component is dx, so the slope we want is the rise over run, dy divided by dx. But

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,200
unlike other tangent slope problems in calculus, this curve is not the graph of a function,

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,600
so we can't just take a simple derivative, asking about the size of some tiny nudge to

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,940
the output of a function caused by some tiny nudge to the input. x is not an input, and

18
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:53,740
y is not an output, they're both just interdependent values related by some equation. This is what's

19
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,240
called an implicit curve, it's just the set of all points x, y that satisfy some property

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,860
written in terms of the two variables, x and y. The procedure for how you actually find

21
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,880
dy, dx for curves like this is the thing I found very weird as a calculus student. You

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,040
take the derivative of both sides like this, for x squared you write 2x times dx, and similarly

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,660
y squared becomes 2y times dy, and then the derivative of that constant 5 squared on the

24
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,080
right is just 0. Now you can see why this feels a little strange, right? What does it

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,640
mean to take the derivative of an expression that has multiple variables in it, and why

26
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,720
is it that we're tacking on dy and dx in this way? But if you just blindly move forward

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,240
with what you get, you can rearrange this equation and find an expression for dy divided

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,860
by dx, which in this case comes out to be negative x divided by y. So at the point with

29
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:05,600
coordinates x, y equals 3, 4, that slope would be negative 3 divided by 4, evidently. This

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,960
strange process is called implicit differentiation. Don't worry, I have an explanation for how

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,820
you can interpret taking a derivative of an expression with two variables like this. But

32
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,600
first I want to set aside this particular problem and show how it's connected to a

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,260
different type of calculus problem, something called a related rates problem. Imagine a

34
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,400
5 meter long ladder held up against a wall where the top of the ladder starts 4 meters

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,580
above the ground, which by the Pythagorean theorem means that the bottom is 3 meters

36
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,620
away from the wall. And let's say it's slipping down in such a way that the top of

37
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,760
the ladder is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second. The question is, in that initial

38
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,800
moment, what's the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall?

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,080
It's interesting, right? That distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall is 100%

40
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,220
determined by the distance from the top of the ladder to the floor. So we should have

41
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,500
enough information to figure out how the rates of change for each of those values actually

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,440
depend on each other, but it might not be entirely clear how exactly you relate those

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,340
two. First things first, it's always nice to give names to the quantities that we care

44
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,480
about, so let's label that distance from the top of the ladder to the ground y of t,

45
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,540
written as a function of time because it's changing. Likewise, label the distance between

46
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,980
the bottom of the ladder and the wall x of t. The key equation that relates these terms

47
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:44,120
is the Pythagorean theorem, x of t squared plus y of t squared equals 5 squared. What

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,120
makes that a powerful equation to use is that it's true at all points of time. One way

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,640
that you could solve this would be to isolate x of t, and then figure out what y of t has

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,540
to be based on that 1 m per second drop rate, and you could take the derivative of the resulting

51
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,000
function dx dt, the rate at which x is changing with respect to time. That's fine, it involves

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,600
a couple layers of using the chain rule, and it'll definitely work for you, but I want

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,440
to show a different way that you can think about the same problem. This left hand side

54
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,000
of the equation is a function of time, right? It just so happens to equal a constant, meaning

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,320
the value evidently doesn't change while time passes, but it's still written as an expression

56
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,820
dependent on time, which means we can manipulate it like any other function that has t as an

57
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,080
input. In particular, we can take a derivative of this left hand side, which is a way of

58
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,860
saying if I let a little bit of time pass, some small dt, which causes y to slightly

59
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,340
decrease and x to slightly increase, how much does this expression change? On the one

60
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,360
hand, we know that the derivative should be 0, since the expression is a constant, and

61
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,280
constants don't care about your tiny nudges in time, they just remain unchanged. But on

62
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,360
the other hand, what do you get when you compute this derivative? Well, the derivative of x

63
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,240
of t squared is 2 times x of t times the derivative of x. That's the chain rule I talked about

64
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,380
in the last video. 2x dx represents the size of a change to x squared caused by some change

65
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,920
to x, and then we're dividing out by dt. Likewise, the rate at which y of t squared

66
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:37,560
is changing is 2 times y of t times the derivative of y. Now evidently, this whole expression

67
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,680
must be 0, and that's an equivalent way of saying that x squared plus y squared must

68
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,640
not change while the ladder moves. At the very start, time t equals 0, the height, y

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,840
of t, is 4 meters, and that distance x of t is 3 meters. And since the top of the ladder

70
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,800
is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second, that derivative, dy dt, is negative 1 meters

71
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,760
per second. Now, this gives us enough information to isolate the derivative, dx dt, and when

72
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,360
you work it out, it comes out to be 4 thirds meters per second.

73
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,900
The reason I bring up this ladder problem is that I want you to compare it to the problem

74
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,180
of finding the slope of a tangent line to the circle. In both cases, we had the equation

75
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,640
x squared plus y squared equals 5 squared, and in both cases we ended up taking the derivative

76
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,120
of each side of this expression. But for the ladder question, these expressions were functions

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,620
of time, so taking the derivative has a clear meaning, it's the rate at which the expression

78
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,560
changes as time changes. But what makes the circle situation strange is that rather than

79
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,340
saying that a small amount of time dt has passed, which causes x and y to change, the

80
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,480
derivative just has these tiny nudges dx and dy just floating free, not tied to some other

81
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,600
common variable, like time. Let me show you a nice way to think about

82
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,620
this. Let's give this expression x squared plus y squared a name, maybe s. s is essentially

83
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,220
a function of two variables. It takes every point xy on the plane and associates it with

84
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,900
a number. For points on this circle, that number is 25. If you stepped off the circle

85
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:31,580
away from the center, that value would be bigger. For other points xy closer to the

86
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,500
derivative of this expression, a derivative of s, is to consider a tiny change to both

87
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:45,080
of these variables, some tiny change dx to x, and some tiny change dy to y, and not necessarily

88
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,520
one that keeps you on the circle, by the way, it's just any tiny step in any direction

89
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,080
of the xy plane. From there you ask how much does the value of s change? That difference,

90
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,000
the difference in the value of s before the nudge and after the nudge, is what I'm

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,920
writing as ds. For example, in this picture we're starting

92
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,660
off at a point where x equals 3 and where y equals 4, and let's just say that the

93
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:22,880
step I drew has dx at negative 0.02 and dy at negative 0.01. Then the decrease in s,

94
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,660
the amount that x2 plus y2 changes over that step, would be about 2 times 3 times negative

95
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:38,520
0.02 plus 2 times 4 times negative 0.01. That's what this derivative expression, 2x dx plus

96
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,880
2y dy, actually means. It's a recipe for telling you how much the value x2 plus y2

97
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,060
changes as determined by the point xy where you start and the tiny step dx dy you take.

98
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,920
As with all things derivative, this is only an approximation, but it's one that gets

99
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,540
truer and truer for smaller and smaller choices of dx and dy. The key point here is that when

100
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,660
you restrict yourself to steps along the circle, you're essentially saying you want to ensure

101
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,080
that this value of s doesn't change. It starts at a value of 25 and you want to keep

102
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:23,080
it at a value of 25. That is, ds should be 0. So setting the expression 2x dx plus 2y

103
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,220
dy equal to 0 is the condition under which one of these tiny steps actually stays on

104
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,860
the circle. Again, this is only an approximation. Speaking more precisely, that condition is

105
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,140
what keeps you on the tangent line of the circle, not the circle itself. But for tiny

106
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,900
enough steps, those are essentially the same thing.

107
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,780
Of course, there's nothing special about the expression x2 plus y2 equals 5 squared.

108
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,880
It's always nice to think through more examples, so let's consider this expression sin of

109
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,640
x times y2 equals x. This corresponds to a whole bunch of u-shaped curves on the plane.

110
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:11,340
Those curves represent all the points xy where the value of sin of x times y2 equals x.

111
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now imagine taking some tiny step with components dx and dy, and not necessarily one that keeps

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,980
you on the curve. Taking the derivative of each side of this equation will tell us how

113
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,440
much the value of that side changes during the step.

114
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,320
On the left side, the product rule tells us that this should be left d right plus right

115
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:47,460
d left. That is, sin of x times the change to y2, which is 2y dy, plus y2 times the change

116
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:55,460
to sin of x, which is cos x times dx. The right side is simply x, so the size of a change

117
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:03,740
is exactly dx. Setting these two sides equal to each other is a way of saying, whatever

118
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,980
your tiny step with coordinates dx and dy is, if it's going to keep us on the curve,

119
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,980
the values of both the left and right side must change by the same amount. That's the

120
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,410
only way this top equation can remain true. From there, depending on what problem you're

121
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,970
trying to solve, you have something to work with algebraically, and maybe the most common

122
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,110
goal is to try to figure out what dy divided by dx is.

123
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,190
As a final example here, I want to show you how you can use this technique of implicit

124
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,870
differentiation to figure out new derivative formulas. I've mentioned that the derivative

125
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:52,350
of e to the x is itself, but what about the derivative of its inverse function, the natural

126
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,830
log of x, can be thought of as an implicit curve. It's all of the points xy on the

127
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,770
plane where y happens to equal ln of x. It just happens to be the case that the x's

128
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,690
and y's of this equation aren't as intermingled as they were in our other examples. The slope

129
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:22,330
of this graph, dy divided by dx, should be the derivative of ln of x, right? Well, to

130
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:28,310
e to the y equals x. This is exactly what the natural log of x means, it's saying

131
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:34,870
e to the what equals x. Since we know the derivative of e to the y, we can take the

132
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,110
derivative of both sides here, effectively asking how a tiny step with components dx

133
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:46,430
and dy changes the value of each one of these sides. To ensure that a step stays on the

134
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,750
curve, the change to the left side of the equation, which is e to the y times dy, must

135
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,010
equal the change to the right side, which in this case is just dx. Rearranging, that

136
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:07,370
means dy divided by dx, the slope of our graph, equals 1 divided by e to the y. When we're

137
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,990
on the curve, e to the y is by definition the same thing as x, so evidently this slope

138
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:19,170
is 1 divided by x. And of course, an expression for the slope of a graph of a function written

139
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,790
in terms of x like this is the derivative of that function, so evidently the derivative

140
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:35,610
of ln of x is 1 divided by x. By the way, all of this is a little sneak peek

141
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,070
into multivariable calculus, where you consider functions that have multiple inputs and how

142
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:47,610
they change as you tweak those multiple inputs. The key, as always, is to have a clear image

143
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,070
in your head of what tiny nudges are at play, and how exactly they depend on each other.

144
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,230
Next up, I'm going to be talking about limits, and how they're used to formalize the idea

145
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,950
