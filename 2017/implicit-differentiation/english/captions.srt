00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,214
Let me share with you something I found particularly 

2
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:16,000
weird when I was a student first learning calculus.

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,540
Let's say you have a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin of the xy plane.

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,392
This is something defined with the equation x2 plus y2 equals 5 squared, 

5
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:30,702
that is, all the points on the circle are a distance 5 from the origin as 

6
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:34,954
encapsulated by the Pythagorean theorem, where the sum of the squares of 

7
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:39,440
the two legs on this triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse, 5 squared.

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,985
And suppose you want to find the slope of a tangent line to the circle, 

9
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:47,060
maybe at the point xy equals 3,4.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,845
Now if you're savvy with geometry, you might already know that this 

11
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,660
tangent line is perpendicular to the radius touching it at that point.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,479
But let's say you don't already know that, or maybe you want 

13
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,680
a technique that generalizes to curves other than just circles.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,388
As with other problems about the slopes of tangent lines to curves, 

15
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:11,434
the key thought here is to zoom in close enough that the curve basically 

16
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:16,200
looks just like its own tangent line, and then ask about a tiny step along that curve.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,502
The y component of that little step is what you might call dy, 

18
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:27,720
and the x component is dx, so the slope we want is the rise over run, dy divided by dx.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,702
But unlike other tangent slope problems in calculus, 

20
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:36,932
this curve is not the graph of a function, so we can't just take a simple derivative, 

21
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:42,040
asking about the size of some tiny nudge to the output of a function caused by some 

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,500
tiny nudge to the input.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,991
x is not an input, and y is not an output, they're both 

24
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:51,680
just interdependent values related by some equation.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,320
This is what's called an implicit curve, it's just the set of all points x, 

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,820
y that satisfy some property written in terms of the two variables, x and y.

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,576
The procedure for how you actually find dy, dx for curves like 

28
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:12,020
this is the thing I found very weird as a calculus student.

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,179
You take the derivative of both sides like this, for x squared you write 2x times dx, 

30
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:24,409
and similarly y squared becomes 2y times dy, and then the derivative 

31
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,200
of that constant 5 squared on the right is just 0.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,100
Now you can see why this feels a little strange, right?

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,130
What does it mean to take the derivative of an expression that has multiple 

34
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,640
variables in it, and why is it that we're tacking on dy and dx in this way?

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,145
But if you just blindly move forward with what you get, 

36
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:51,294
you can rearrange this equation and find an expression for dy divided by dx, 

37
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:55,240
which in this case comes out to be negative x divided by y.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,927
So at the point with coordinates x, y equals 3, 4, 

39
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:04,120
that slope would be negative 3 divided by 4, evidently.

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,860
This strange process is called implicit differentiation.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,713
Don't worry, I have an explanation for how you can interpret 

42
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:16,060
taking a derivative of an expression with two variables like this.

43
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,040
But first I want to set aside this particular problem and show how it's connected 

44
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,500
to a different type of calculus problem, something called a related rates problem.

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,453
Imagine a 5 meter long ladder held up against a wall where the top 

46
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,414
of the ladder starts 4 meters above the ground, 

47
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:38,720
which by the Pythagorean theorem means that the bottom is 3 meters away from the wall.

48
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,752
And let's say it's slipping down in such a way that the top 

49
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:45,780
of the ladder is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second.

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,280
The question is, in that initial moment, what's the rate at 

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,800
which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall?

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
It's interesting, right?

53
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,417
That distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall is 100% 

54
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:04,540
determined by the distance from the top of the ladder to the floor.

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,732
So we should have enough information to figure out how the rates 

56
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:12,400
of change for each of those values actually depend on each other, 

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,180
but it might not be entirely clear how exactly you relate those two.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,619
First things first, it's always nice to give names to the quantities that we care about, 

59
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:25,843
so let's label that distance from the top of the ladder to the ground y of t, 

60
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,660
written as a function of time because it's changing.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,900
Likewise, label the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall x of t.

62
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,547
The key equation that relates these terms is the Pythagorean theorem, 

63
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:43,060
x of t squared plus y of t squared equals 5 squared.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,540
What makes that a powerful equation to use is that it's true at all points of time.

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,221
One way that you could solve this would be to isolate x of t, 

66
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:59,409
and then figure out what y of t has to be based on that 1 m per second drop rate, 

67
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,647
and you could take the derivative of the resulting function dx dt, 

68
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:07,000
the rate at which x is changing with respect to time.

69
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,026
That's fine, it involves a couple layers of using the chain rule, 

70
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:15,296
and it'll definitely work for you, but I want to show a different way that you can think 

71
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:16,400
about the same problem.

72
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,080
This left hand side of the equation is a function of time, right?

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,158
It just so happens to equal a constant, meaning the value evidently doesn't change 

74
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,592
while time passes, but it's still written as an expression dependent on time, 

75
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:35,140
which means we can manipulate it like any other function that has t as an input.

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,261
In particular, we can take a derivative of this left hand side, 

77
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:45,250
which is a way of saying if I let a little bit of time pass, some small dt, 

78
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,451
which causes y to slightly decrease and x to slightly increase, 

79
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,880
how much does this expression change?

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,043
On the one hand, we know that the derivative should be 0, 

81
00:05:56,043 --> 00:06:00,608
since the expression is a constant, and constants don't care about your tiny nudges in 

82
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,340
time, they just remain unchanged.

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,520
But on the other hand, what do you get when you compute this derivative?

84
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,120
Well, the derivative of x of t squared is 2 times x of t times the derivative of x.

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,980
That's the chain rule I talked about in the last video.

86
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,744
2x dx represents the size of a change to x squared caused by some change to x, 

87
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,380
and then we're dividing out by dt.

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,826
Likewise, the rate at which y of t squared is 

89
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:34,660
changing is 2 times y of t times the derivative of y.

90
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,460
Now evidently, this whole expression must be 0, 

91
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,880
and that's an equivalent way of saying that x squared plus y squared must not 

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,580
change while the ladder moves.

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,000
At the very start, time t equals 0, the height, y of t, 

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
is 4 meters, and that distance x of t is 3 meters.

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,655
And since the top of the ladder is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second, 

96
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:03,420
that derivative, dy dt, is negative 1 meters per second.

97
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,909
Now, this gives us enough information to isolate the derivative, dx dt, 

98
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:13,360
and when you work it out, it comes out to be 4 thirds meters per second.

99
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,974
The reason I bring up this ladder problem is that I want you to compare 

100
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:21,520
it to the problem of finding the slope of a tangent line to the circle.

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,674
In both cases, we had the equation x squared plus y squared equals 5 squared, 

102
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:31,320
and in both cases we ended up taking the derivative of each side of this expression.

103
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,229
But for the ladder question, these expressions were functions of time, 

104
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,997
so taking the derivative has a clear meaning, it's the rate at which the expression 

105
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,360
changes as time changes.

106
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,500
But what makes the circle situation strange is that rather than saying that a small 

107
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,368
amount of time dt has passed, which causes x and y to change, 

108
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:56,860
the derivative just has these tiny nudges dx and dy just floating free, 

109
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,980
not tied to some other common variable, like time.

110
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,980
Let me show you a nice way to think about this.

111
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,440
Let's give this expression x squared plus y squared a name, maybe s.

112
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,060
s is essentially a function of two variables.

113
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,660
It takes every point xy on the plane and associates it with a number.

114
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,660
For points on this circle, that number is 25.

115
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,400
If you stepped off the circle away from the center, that value would be bigger.

116
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,743
For other points xy closer to the derivative of this expression, a derivative of s, 

117
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:38,346
is to consider a tiny change to both of these variables, some tiny change dx to x, 

118
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:45,030
and some tiny change dy to y, and not necessarily one that keeps you on the circle, 

119
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,520
by the way, it's just any tiny step in any direction of the xy plane.

120
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,020
From there you ask how much does the value of s change?

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,696
That difference, the difference in the value of s before the nudge and after the nudge, 

122
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:03,380
is what I'm writing as ds.

123
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,460
For example, in this picture we're starting off at a point 

124
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,777
where x equals 3 and where y equals 4, and let's just say that 

125
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:20,180
the step I drew has dx at negative 0.02 and dy at negative 0.01.

126
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,729
Then the decrease in s, the amount that x2 plus y2 changes over that step, 

127
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:34,780
would be about 2 times 3 times negative 0.02 plus 2 times 4 times negative 0.01.

128
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,800
That's what this derivative expression, 2x dx plus 2y dy, actually means.

129
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,538
It's a recipe for telling you how much the value x2 plus y2 changes as 

130
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:52,060
determined by the point xy where you start and the tiny step dx dy you take.

131
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,689
As with all things derivative, this is only an approximation, 

132
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:01,580
but it's one that gets truer and truer for smaller and smaller choices of dx and dy.

133
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,110
The key point here is that when you restrict yourself to steps along the circle, 

134
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,720
you're essentially saying you want to ensure that this value of s doesn't change.

135
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,520
It starts at a value of 25 and you want to keep it at a value of 25.

136
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,100
That is, ds should be 0.

137
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,159
So setting the expression 2x dx plus 2y dy equal to 0 is the condition 

138
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,700
under which one of these tiny steps actually stays on the circle.

139
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,460
Again, this is only an approximation.

140
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,489
Speaking more precisely, that condition is what keeps you 

141
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:39,880
on the tangent line of the circle, not the circle itself.

142
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,900
But for tiny enough steps, those are essentially the same thing.

143
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,780
Of course, there's nothing special about the expression x2 plus y2 equals 5 squared.

144
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,584
It's always nice to think through more examples, 

145
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:57,500
so let's consider this expression sin of x times y2 equals x.

146
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,640
This corresponds to a whole bunch of u-shaped curves on the plane.

147
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:11,340
Those curves represent all the points xy where the value of sin of x times y2 equals x.

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,616
Now imagine taking some tiny step with components dx and dy, 

149
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:22,700
and not necessarily one that keeps you on the curve.

150
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,724
Taking the derivative of each side of this equation will tell 

151
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:31,440
us how much the value of that side changes during the step.

152
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,750
On the left side, the product rule tells us that 

153
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,840
this should be left d right plus right d left.

154
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,038
That is, sin of x times the change to y2, which is 2y dy, 

155
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:50,980
plus y2 times the change to sin of x, which is cos x times dx.

156
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,620
The right side is simply x, so the size of a change is exactly dx.

157
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,551
Setting these two sides equal to each other is a way of saying, 

158
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:07,325
whatever your tiny step with coordinates dx and dy is, 

159
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:12,609
if it's going to keep us on the curve, the values of both the left and right 

160
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,080
side must change by the same amount.

161
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,860
That's the only way this top equation can remain true.

162
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,792
From there, depending on what problem you're trying to solve, 

163
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,500
you have something to work with algebraically, 

164
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,110
and maybe the most common goal is to try to figure out what dy divided by dx is.

165
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,128
As a final example here, I want to show you how you can use this 

166
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:41,710
technique of implicit differentiation to figure out new derivative formulas.

167
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,939
I've mentioned that the derivative of e to the x is itself, 

168
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:52,469
but what about the derivative of its inverse function, the natural log of x, 

169
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:55,270
can be thought of as an implicit curve.

170
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,830
It's all of the points xy on the plane where y happens to equal ln of x.

171
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,658
It just happens to be the case that the x's and y's of this 

172
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,130
equation aren't as intermingled as they were in our other examples.

173
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:15,410
The slope of this graph, dy divided by dx, should be the derivative of ln of x, right?

174
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:24,030
Well, to e to the y equals x.

175
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:30,850
This is exactly what the natural log of x means, it's saying e to the what equals x.

176
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,378
Since we know the derivative of e to the y, we can take the 

177
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:39,238
derivative of both sides here, effectively asking how a tiny step 

178
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:43,390
with components dx and dy changes the value of each one of these sides.

179
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:50,138
To ensure that a step stays on the curve, the change to the left side of the equation, 

180
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:54,715
which is e to the y times dy, must equal the change to the right side, 

181
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,650
which in this case is just dx.

182
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,531
Rearranging, that means dy divided by dx, the slope of our graph, 

183
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:06,190
equals 1 divided by e to the y.

184
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,822
When we're on the curve, e to the y is by definition the same thing as x, 

185
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,610
so evidently this slope is 1 divided by x.

186
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,987
And of course, an expression for the slope of a graph of a function 

187
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:24,145
written in terms of x like this is the derivative of that function, 

188
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:27,630
so evidently the derivative of ln of x is 1 divided by x.

189
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,194
By the way, all of this is a little sneak peek into multivariable calculus, 

190
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:40,994
where you consider functions that have multiple inputs and how 

191
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:43,830
they change as you tweak those multiple inputs.

192
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,939
The key, as always, is to have a clear image in your head of what 

193
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:53,070
tiny nudges are at play, and how exactly they depend on each other.

194
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,933
Next up, I'm going to be talking about limits, 

195
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:59,950
and how they're used to formalize the idea of a derivative.

196
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,730
Thank you.
