1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
The setup here starts with a cylinder full of sugar water, basically,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,500
and we're about to shine some white light into it,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,660
but before it gets there, it passes through a linearly polarizing filter.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,500
And what that means, basically,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,300
is that if you look at all of the light waves beyond the point of that filter,

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,700
those waves are only going to be wiggling in one direction, say up and down.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,900
And don't worry, in a few minutes we're going to go into much more detail

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,860
about what specifically is wiggling and what the significance of that wiggling direction is,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,660
but skipping to the punchline first,

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,260
the demo also includes a second linearly polarizing filter coming out the other end,

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,960
and I want you to predict what we're going to see once we turn the light on.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,160
Now I suspect some viewers might already have a little bit of a sense for what's going on,

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,560
because a few years ago, Steve Mould made a really excellent video

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,460
about this phenomenon of shining polarized light through sugar water.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,460
It was really well done, which is no surprise because everything Steve makes is,

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,160
but even if you watched that, this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's still more to be explained.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,760
In fact, even if you made that video, this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's more to be explained.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,060
I'm curious, Steve, when you made that video, did you happen to get a good view of the side of the glass,

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,860
probably when the rest of the lights in the room were off or something like that?

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,660
No. No, I didn't think about the side view.

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,660
Great. So given the setup that we're looking at now,

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,560
once we turn off the room lights and turn on the lamp,

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm curious if you have a prediction for what you might see.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,660
Well, there will be some scattering, I suppose.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,660
But then if we're just looking at the tube, we're not applying any kind of filter to just looking directly at the tube.

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,760
So, I mean, my instinct is nothing will happen.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,560
That would have been my guess too.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,260
But let me just show you what it looks like when we turn off the room lights and we turn on the lamp.

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,760
And then if you turn the initial polarizer, you can kind of see those stripes,

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,360
those diagonal stripes seem to walk up the tube.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,760
Oh, wow. But why diagonal?

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,460
Exactly. Why diagonal?

33
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,060
But why anything? I mean, why anything?

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,260
Something about the interaction with sugar water separates the light out into these different bands of color.

35
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:19,360
But it does so in this really intriguing way, where the colors appear to form these spiral helixes down the tube.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,960
And the other thing I want to draw your attention to is the color that's coming out of the tube after it passes through that second filter.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,060
As we rotate the first filter, you rotate through a family of distinct hues.

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,760
And it doesn't have to be the first filter. If you rotate that second filter, you also rotate through these various different colors.

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,260
That's Quinn, by the way, who kindly set up this whole demo.

40
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,860
And what I love about this setup is that if you want to really understand what you're looking at,

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,660
with that deep to your bones satisfying sense of what's going on,

42
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,160
it requires having very solid intuitions for a number of different fundamental concepts about light,

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,760
like polarization, how scattering works, and how an index of refraction works.

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,660
To kick things off, let me show you the overall structure for the explanation of what's going on here.

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,960
And along the way, record various questions that we still need to answer.

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,360
A basic premise to the whole thing is to think about polarized light as a propagating wave which is wiggling in just one direction.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,260
And I suppose question number zero is for us to be clear about what exactly is wiggling.

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,660
Postponing that for the moment, we'll just say if we think about it as propagating in one direction, say along an x-axis,

49
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,760
the wiggling happens perpendicular to that, say in the z direction.

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,760
What's going on when it passes through this tube of sugar water is that that wiggling direction gets twisted.

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,460
And so the first key question is why? What is it about interaction with sugar that causes this twist?

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,460
And just so that it's crystal clear what I mean by twisting,

53
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,060
if you focus your attention on a single slice perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder

54
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,060
and draw a line indicating how the light is wiggling on that slice,

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,160
then if you were to move that slice down the cylinder,

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,660
the relevant wiggling direction slowly turns about the axis of the cylinder.

57
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,160
Critically, the rate at which it's getting twisted depends on the frequency of the light.

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,060
Higher frequency light, say violet, actually gets twisted more quickly than low frequency light, like red.

59
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,060
So the second key question we need to answer is why would that twisting rate depend on the frequency?

60
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,060
Whatever explanation we come to for why the twisting happens in the first place,

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,560
it should offer some intuition for where the dependence on frequency would come from.

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,260
Let's take a moment to think about what it means that different colors of light are getting twisted at different rates.

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:45,760
In the demo we're shining in white light, and white light is not a clean pure sine wave, it's something more complicated.

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,960
And you typically think about it as a combination of many different pure sine waves,

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,260
each one corresponding to one of the colors in the rainbow.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,160
For this animation I will schematically represent the wiggling direction for each pure frequency, just with a line.

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,760
So the key idea is that as all of those different waves propagate down the tube,

68
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,760
with different pure frequencies twisting at different rates, purple light twisting the fastest and red light twisting the slowest,

69
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,160
then the polarization directions for each one of those pure colors get separated out.

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,560
For example, by the time you reach the end of the tube, they all have their own distinct wiggling directions.

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
But one thing that's important to understand is that this is still white light.

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,060
If you were to put your eye at the end of the tube and look towards the lamp, it wouldn't look colored in any way,

73
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,360
because even if the wiggling directions are all different, there's still the same amount of each color as there was at the start.

74
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,660
In order to see any evidence of this separation, one thing you could do is pass it all through a second linear polarizing filter,

75
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
say in the vertical direction.

76
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,860
The effect that has is that the amount of light of a given frequency passing through

77
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,460
is equal to the component of its polarization direction that lines up with the filter.

78
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,660
So colors which happen to align very closely with that filter pass through almost completely,

79
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,460
whereas colors which end up more perpendicular to the filter pass through only very weakly.

80
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,460
So the light coming out the other end of this filter is some imbalanced combination of all of the pure frequencies,

81
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,060
which is why what we see coming out the other end is no longer white, but some other color.

82
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,660
And notice if we rotate the whole setup, say by twisting the initial polarizing filter,

83
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,460
then that changes the components of each pure frequency that happen to be vertical,

84
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,460
resulting in a different balance of all those colors,

85
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,760
which is why rotating the initial filter changes the color you see coming out the other end.

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,260
And this is something you can do at home, by the way. You don't need a very fancy setup.

87
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,060
Start by creating a pretty dense mixture of sugar water,

88
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,760
and then you'll need to get your hands on some polarizing filters so that you can pass light first through one of those filters,

89
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,060
then through the sugar water, and then through a second filter.

90
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,760
And if you look at this whole setup from the top, as you rotate one of those filters, you'll see different colors.

91
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,260
But even if you understand this, the thing that really had me scratching my head when Quinn showed me this demo

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,060
was why you would see diagonal stripes when you view the cylinder from the side.

93
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
I mean, take a moment to think about this.

94
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,060
At any point down the tube, even though all the colors have been rotated differently,

95
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,560
again, the light at that point is still white. It's still an equal balance of all the different colors.

96
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,260
If you were to stick your eye inside the tube and look towards the lamp, you would see white.

97
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,860
So why would viewing it from the side change what you see?

98
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,560
The way I've made this animation, I've just left a faint shadow representing the wiggling direction for each color along the way down the tube.

99
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,360
But that's just a cartoon. It's a schematic representation.

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Why is it that the actual way that light interacts with the molecules within the tube would discriminate between the colors in any way?

101
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,560
And why would the stripes be diagonal? Wouldn't you think the setup should be completely symmetric from top to bottom?

102
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,060
So these are the main questions we need to answer.

103
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,360
Why would sugar cause the light to twist?

104
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,060
Why would the rate at which it twists depend on the frequency of the light?

105
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,560
And why, even if you understand both those facts, would you be seeing different colors appear in these diagonal stripes?

106
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,560
You can answer these questions if you have a handful of key intuitions about optics.

107
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,060
The first question requires understanding circularly polarized light, since the key is that sucrose is a chiral molecule,

108
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,060
which is to say there's a handedness to it. It's different from its mirror image.

109
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,060
And the slightly different effects that it has on right-handed versus left-handed circularly polarized light ends up explaining the twist.

110
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:44,560
The second question requires understanding why light appears to slow down when it passes through a material.

111
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,560
A sufficiently mathematical understanding for where that slowdown comes from ultimately explains the color separation here.

112
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:59,060
And the third question comes down to the fact that when light scatters off of a material, it's not like some projectile bouncing in any old direction.

113
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,060
The direction of scattering depends on the direction of polarization, and there's a very good reason for it.

114
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,060
My aim is for all of these answers to feel less like facts that I'm handing down from on high,

115
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,060
and more like inevitable discoveries emerging from a fundamental understanding for what light actually is.

116
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,560
For that, we'll begin by returning to that question number zero, what exactly is wiggling?

117
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,060
Which is to say, what is light?

118
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,060
