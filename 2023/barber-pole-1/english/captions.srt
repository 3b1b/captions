1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,102
The setup here starts with a cylinder full of sugar water, 

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:06,361
basically, and we're about to shine some white light into it, 

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:10,200
but before it gets there, it passes through a linearly polarizing filter.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,916
And what that means, basically, is that if you look at all of 

5
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,364
the light waves beyond the point of that filter, 

6
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,160
those waves are only going to be wiggling in one direction, say up and down.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,356
And don't worry, in a few minutes we're going to go into much more detail 

8
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:27,739
about what specifically is wiggling and what the significance of that 

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,639
wiggling direction is, but skipping to the punchline first, 

10
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:34,747
the demo also includes a second linearly polarizing filter coming out the other end, 

11
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:38,420
and I want you to predict what we're going to see once we turn the light on.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,635
Now I suspect some viewers might already have a little bit of a sense for 

13
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:46,376
what's going on, because a few years ago Steve Mould made a really excellent 

14
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:50,020
video about this phenomenon of shining polarized light through sugar water.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,224
It was really well done, which is no surprise because everything Steve makes is, 

16
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:57,120
but even if you watched that, this is a rich enough phenomenon 

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
that there's still more to be explained.

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,794
In fact, even if you made that video, this is a rich 

19
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,319
enough phenomenon that there's more to be explained.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,566
I'm curious, Steve, when you made that video, did you happen 

21
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:10,403
to get a good view of the side of the glass, probably when the 

22
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,240
rest of the lights in the room were off or something like that?

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,260
No.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,920
No, I didn't think about the side view.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:17,920
Great.

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,106
So given the setup that we're looking at now, once we turn off the room lights 

27
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:26,140
and turn on the lamp, I'm curious if you have a prediction for what you might see.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,812
Well, there will be some scattering, I suppose, 

29
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:35,027
but then if we're just looking at the tube, we're not applying any kind of filter 

30
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,380
to just looking directly at the tube.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,220
So, I mean, my instinct is nothing will happen.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,720
That would have been my guess too, but let me just show you what it 

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,600
looks like when we turn off the room lights and we turn on the lamp.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,560
Ooh.

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,780
And then if you turn the initial polarizer, you can kind of see those.

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,180
Wow.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,060
Stripes, those diagonal stripes seem to walk up the tube.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,860
Oh, wow.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,260
But why diagonal?

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,160
Exactly, why diagonal?

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,200
But why anything?

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,420
I mean, why anything?

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,363
Something about the interaction with sugar water separates the light out 

44
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:14,098
into these different bands of color, but it does so in this really intriguing way, 

45
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,920
where the colors appear to form these spiral helixes down the tube.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,318
And the other thing I want to draw your attention to is the color 

47
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,900
that's coming out of the tube after it passes through that second filter.

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,300
As we rotate the first filter, you rotate through a family of distinct hues.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,373
And it doesn't have to be the first filter if you rotate that second filter, 

50
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,640
you also rotate through these various different colors.

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
That's Quinn, by the way, who kindly set up this whole demo.

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,967
And what I love about this setup is that if you want to really understand what you're 

53
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:51,127
looking at with that deep to your bones satisfying sense of what's going on, 

54
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:55,882
it requires having very solid intuitions for a number of different fundamental concepts 

55
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:58,800
about light, like polarization, how scattering works, 

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
and how an index of refraction works.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,853
To kick things off, let me show you the overall structure for the explanation of what's 

58
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,860
going on here, and along the way record various questions that we still need to answer.

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,232
A basic premise to the whole thing is to think about polarized 

60
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,700
light as a propagating wave which is wiggling in just one direction.

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,860
And I suppose question number zero is for us to be clear about what exactly is wiggling.

62
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,728
Postponing that for the moment, we'll just say if we think about 

63
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,629
it as propagating in one direction, say along an x-axis, 

64
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:33,040
the wiggling happens perpendicular to that, say in the z-direction.

65
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,276
What's going on when it passes through this tube of 

66
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:39,100
sugar water is that that wiggling direction gets twisted.

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,040
And so the first key question is why?

68
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,080
What is it about interaction with sugar that causes this twist?

69
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,582
And just so that it's crystal clear what I mean by twisting, 

70
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:53,693
if you focus your attention on a single slice perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, 

71
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:57,597
and draw a line indicating how the light is wiggling on that slice, 

72
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:00,755
then if you were to move that slice down the cylinder, 

73
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:05,120
the relevant wiggling direction slowly turns about the axis of the cylinder.

74
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,720
Critically, the rate at which it's getting twisted depends on the frequency of the light.

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,842
Higher frequency light, say violet, actually gets 

76
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:17,339
twisted more quickly than low frequency light, like red.

77
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,837
So the second key question we need to answer is 

78
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,640
why would that twisting rate depend on the frequency?

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,231
Whatever explanation we come to for why the twisting happens in the first place, 

80
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:32,420
it should offer some intuition for where the dependence on frequency would come from.

81
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,010
Let's take a moment to think about what it means that 

82
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,840
different colors of light are getting twisted at different rates.

83
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,709
In the demo we're shining in white light, and white light is not a clean pure sine wave, 

84
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,460
it's something more complicated.

85
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,779
And you typically think about it as a combination of many different pure sine waves, 

86
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:52,500
each one corresponding to one of the colors in the rainbow.

87
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,263
For this animation I will schematically represent the 

88
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,520
wiggling direction for each pure frequency, just with a line.

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,790
So the key idea is that as all of those different waves propagate down the tube, 

90
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,188
with different pure frequencies twisting at different rates, 

91
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:12,086
purple light twisting the fastest and red light twisting the slowest, 

92
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:16,820
then the polarization directions for each one of those pure colors get separated out.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,655
For example, by the time you reach the end of the tube, 

94
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,980
they all have their own distinct wiggling directions.

95
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,380
But one thing that's important to understand is that this is still white light.

96
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,140
If you were to put your eye at the end of the tube and look towards the lamp, 

97
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,005
it wouldn't look colored in any way, because even if the wiggling directions are 

98
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:38,060
all different, they're still the same amount of each color as there was at the start.

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,190
In order to see any evidence of this separation, 

100
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,605
one thing you could do is pass it all through a second linear polarizing filter, 

101
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:47,240
say in the vertical direction.

102
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,840
The effect that has is that the amount of light of a given frequency passing through 

103
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,900
is equal to the component of its polarization direction that lines up with the filter.

104
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,418
So colors which happen to align very closely with that filter 

105
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:04,824
pass through almost completely, whereas colors which end up 

106
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:08,400
more perpendicular to the filter pass through only very weakly.

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,125
So the light coming out the other end of this filter is some imbalanced 

108
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,618
combination of all of the pure frequencies, which is why what we see 

109
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:20,960
coming out the other end is no longer white, but some other color.

110
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,700
And notice if we rotate the whole setup, say by twisting the initial polarizing filter, 

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,302
then that changes the components of each pure frequency that happen to be vertical, 

112
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:34,260
resulting in a different balance of all those colors, 

113
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,533
which is why rotating the initial filter changes the color you see coming out 

114
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,300
the other end.

115
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,560
And this is something you can do at home, by the way.

116
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,000
You don't need a very fancy setup.

117
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,982
Start by creating a pretty dense mixture of sugar water, 

118
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:49,696
and then you'll need to get your hands on some polarizing filters so that you can 

119
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:53,185
pass light first through one of those filters, then through the sugar water, 

120
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,680
and then through a second filter.

121
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,464
And if you look at this whole setup from the top, 

122
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,440
as you rotate one of those filters, you'll see different colors.

123
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,912
But even if you understand this, the thing that really had me 

124
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:08,044
scratching my head when Quinn showed me this demo was why you 

125
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:11,480
would see diagonal stripes when you view the cylinder from the side.

126
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,860
I mean, take a moment to think about this.

127
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,419
At any point down the tube, even though all the colors have been rotated differently, 

128
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,740
again, the light at that point is still white.

129
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,240
It's still an equal balance of all the different colors.

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,095
If you were to stick your eye inside the tube and look towards the lamp, 

131
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,020
you would see white.

132
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,160
So why would viewing it from the side change what you see?

133
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,409
The way I've made this animation, I've just left a faint shadow representing 

134
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,280
the wiggling direction for each color along the way down the tube.

135
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,220
But that's just a cartoon.

136
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,900
It's a schematic representation.

137
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,591
Why is it that the actual way that light interacts with the molecules 

138
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:49,020
within the tube would discriminate between the colors in any way?

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,100
And why would the stripes be diagonal?

140
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,380
Wouldn't you think the setup should be completely symmetric from top to bottom?

141
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,720
So these are the main questions we need to answer.

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,880
Why would sugar cause the light to twist?

143
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,840
Why would the rate at which it twists depend on the frequency of the light?

144
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,523
And why, even if you understand both those facts, 

145
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:12,280
would you be seeing different colors appear in these diagonal stripes?

146
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
You can answer these questions if you have a handful of key intuitions about optics.

147
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,382
The first question requires understanding circularly polarized light, 

148
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:25,207
since the key is that sucrose is a chiral molecule, 

149
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:29,662
which is to say there's a handedness to it, it's different from its mirror image, 

150
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:34,117
and the slightly different effects that it has on right-handed versus left-handed 

151
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:37,159
circularly polarized light ends up explaining the twist.

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,086
The second question requires understanding why light 

153
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:44,039
appears to slow down when it passes through a material.

154
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,635
A sufficiently mathematical understanding for where that 

155
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:51,080
slowdown comes from ultimately explains the color separation here.

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,944
And the third question comes down to the fact that when light scatters off of a material, 

157
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:58,840
it's not like some projectile bouncing in any old direction.

158
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,793
The direction of scattering depends on the direction of polarization, 

159
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,940
and there's a very good reason for it.

160
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,130
My aim is for all of these answers to feel less like facts that I'm 

161
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,772
handing down from on high, and more like inevitable discoveries 

162
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:17,700
emerging from a fundamental understanding for what light actually is.

163
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,220
For that, we'll begin by returning to that question number zero, what exactly is wiggling?

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,420
