1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
The setup here starts with a cylinder full of sugar water, basically,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,380
and we're about to shine some white light into it,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,200
but before it gets there, it passes through a linearly polarizing filter.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,140
And what that means, basically,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,960
is that if you look at all of the light waves beyond the point of that filter,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
those waves are only going to be wiggling in one direction, say up and down.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,900
And don't worry, in a few minutes we're going to go into much more detail

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,620
about what specifically is wiggling and what the significance of that wiggling direction is,

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,480
but skipping to the punchline first,

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,020
the demo also includes a second linearly polarizing filter coming out the other end,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,420
and I want you to predict what we're going to see once we turn the light on.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,080
Now I suspect some viewers might already have a little bit of a sense for what's going on,

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,420
because a few years ago Steve Mould made a really excellent video

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,020
about this phenomenon of shining polarized light through sugar water.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,040
It was really well done, which is no surprise because everything Steve makes is,

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,600
but even if you watched that,

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's still more to be explained.

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,200
In fact, even if you made that video,

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,320
this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's more to be explained.

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm curious, Steve, when you made that video,

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,860
did you happen to get a good view of the side of the glass,

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,240
probably when the rest of the lights in the room were off or something like that?

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,260
No.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,920
No, I didn't think about the side view.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,300
Great. So given the setup that we're looking at now,

26
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,080
once we turn off the room lights and turn on the lamp,

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm curious if you have a prediction for what you might see.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,920
Well, there will be some scattering, I suppose,

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,080
but then if we're just looking at the tube,

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,380
we're not applying any kind of filter to just looking directly at the tube.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,220
So, I mean, my instinct is nothing will happen.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,260
That would have been my guess too,

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,600
but let me just show you what it looks like when we turn off the room lights and we turn on the lamp.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,560
Ooh.

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,780
And then if you turn the initial polarizer, you can kind of see those.

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,180
Wow.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,060
Stripes, those diagonal stripes seem to walk up the tube.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,860
Oh, wow.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,260
But why diagonal?

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,160
Exactly, why diagonal?

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,420
But why anything? I mean, why anything?

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,580
Something about the interaction with sugar water separates the light out into these different bands of color,

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,480
but it does so in this really intriguing way,

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,920
where the colors appear to form these spiral helixes down the tube.

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,660
And the other thing I want to draw your attention to

46
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,900
is the color that's coming out of the tube after it passes through that second filter.

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,300
As we rotate the first filter, you rotate through a family of distinct hues.

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,140
And it doesn't have to be the first filter if you rotate that second filter,

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,640
you also rotate through these various different colors.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
That's Quinn, by the way, who kindly set up this whole demo.

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,760
And what I love about this setup is that if you want to really understand what you're looking at

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,460
with that deep to your bones satisfying sense of what's going on,

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,760
it requires having very solid intuitions for a number of different fundamental concepts about light,

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,800
like polarization, how scattering works, and how an index of refraction works.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,320
To kick things off, let me show you the overall structure for the explanation of what's going on here,

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,860
and along the way record various questions that we still need to answer.

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,700
A basic premise to the whole thing is to think about polarized light as a propagating wave which is wiggling in just one direction.

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,860
And I suppose question number zero is for us to be clear about what exactly is wiggling.

59
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,120
Postponing that for the moment, we'll just say if we think about it as propagating in one direction, say along an x-axis,

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,040
the wiggling happens perpendicular to that, say in the z-direction.

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,100
What's going on when it passes through this tube of sugar water is that that wiggling direction gets twisted.

62
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,080
And so the first key question is why? What is it about interaction with sugar that causes this twist?

63
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,060
And just so that it's crystal clear what I mean by twisting,

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,760
if you focus your attention on a single slice perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder,

65
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,600
and draw a line indicating how the light is wiggling on that slice,

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,780
then if you were to move that slice down the cylinder,

67
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,120
the relevant wiggling direction slowly turns about the axis of the cylinder.

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,720
Critically, the rate at which it's getting twisted depends on the frequency of the light.

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,340
Higher frequency light, say violet, actually gets twisted more quickly than low frequency light, like red.

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,640
So the second key question we need to answer is why would that twisting rate depend on the frequency?

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,780
Whatever explanation we come to for why the twisting happens in the first place,

72
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,420
it should offer some intuition for where the dependence on frequency would come from.

73
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,840
Let's take a moment to think about what it means that different colors of light are getting twisted at different rates.

74
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,460
In the demo we're shining in white light, and white light is not a clean pure sine wave, it's something more complicated.

75
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,760
And you typically think about it as a combination of many different pure sine waves,

76
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,500
each one corresponding to one of the colors in the rainbow.

77
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,520
For this animation I will schematically represent the wiggling direction for each pure frequency, just with a line.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,500
So the key idea is that as all of those different waves propagate down the tube,

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,600
with different pure frequencies twisting at different rates, purple light twisting the fastest and red light twisting the slowest,

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,820
then the polarization directions for each one of those pure colors get separated out.

81
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,980
For example, by the time you reach the end of the tube, they all have their own distinct wiggling directions.

82
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,380
But one thing that's important to understand is that this is still white light.

83
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,880
If you were to put your eye at the end of the tube and look towards the lamp, it wouldn't look colored in any way,

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,060
because even if the wiggling directions are all different, they're still the same amount of each color as there was at the start.

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:47,240
In order to see any evidence of this separation, one thing you could do is pass it all through a second linear polarizing filter, say in the vertical direction.

86
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:57,900
The effect that has is that the amount of light of a given frequency passing through is equal to the component of its polarization direction that lines up with the filter.

87
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,280
So colors which happen to align very closely with that filter pass through almost completely,

88
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,400
whereas colors which end up more perpendicular to the filter pass through only very weakly.

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,160
So the light coming out the other end of this filter is some imbalanced combination of all of the pure frequencies,

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,960
which is why what we see coming out the other end is no longer white, but some other color.

91
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,300
And notice if we rotate the whole setup, say by twisting the initial polarizing filter,

92
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:34,020
then that changes the components of each pure frequency that happen to be vertical, resulting in a different balance of all those colors,

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,300
which is why rotating the initial filter changes the color you see coming out the other end.

94
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,000
And this is something you can do at home, by the way. You don't need a very fancy setup.

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Start by creating a pretty dense mixture of sugar water, and then you'll need to get your hands on some polarizing filters

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,680
so that you can pass light first through one of those filters, then through the sugar water, and then through a second filter.

97
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,440
And if you look at this whole setup from the top, as you rotate one of those filters, you'll see different colors.

98
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,000
But even if you understand this, the thing that really had me scratching my head when Quinn showed me this demo

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,480
was why you would see diagonal stripes when you view the cylinder from the side.

100
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,860
I mean, take a moment to think about this.

101
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,760
At any point down the tube, even though all the colors have been rotated differently,

102
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,240
again, the light at that point is still white. It's still an equal balance of all the different colors.

103
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,020
If you were to stick your eye inside the tube and look towards the lamp, you would see white.

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,160
So why would viewing it from the side change what you see?

105
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,280
The way I've made this animation, I've just left a faint shadow representing the wiggling direction for each color along the way down the tube.

106
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,900
But that's just a cartoon. It's a schematic representation.

107
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:49,020
Why is it that the actual way that light interacts with the molecules within the tube would discriminate between the colors in any way?

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,380
And why would the stripes be diagonal? Wouldn't you think the setup should be completely symmetric from top to bottom?

109
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,720
So these are the main questions we need to answer.

110
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,880
Why would sugar cause the light to twist?

111
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,840
Why would the rate at which it twists depend on the frequency of the light?

112
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,280
And why, even if you understand both those facts, would you be seeing different colors appear in these diagonal stripes?

113
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
You can answer these questions if you have a handful of key intuitions about optics.

114
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:25,780
The first question requires understanding circularly polarized light, since the key is that sucrose is a chiral molecule,

115
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,480
which is to say there's a handedness to it, it's different from its mirror image,

116
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,160
and the slightly different effects that it has on right-handed versus left-handed circularly polarized light ends up explaining the twist.

117
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,040
The second question requires understanding why light appears to slow down when it passes through a material.

118
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,080
A sufficiently mathematical understanding for where that slowdown comes from ultimately explains the color separation here.

119
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,840
And the third question comes down to the fact that when light scatters off of a material, it's not like some projectile bouncing in any old direction.

120
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,940
The direction of scattering depends on the direction of polarization, and there's a very good reason for it.

121
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,600
My aim is for all of these answers to feel less like facts that I'm handing down from on high,

122
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,700
and more like inevitable discoveries emerging from a fundamental understanding for what light actually is.

123
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,220
For that, we'll begin by returning to that question number zero, what exactly is wiggling?

124
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,420
Which is to say, what is light?

125
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,400
If you're curious about how the full explanation unfolds, come join me in the next video.
