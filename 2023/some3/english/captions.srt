00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
This year we ran the third Summer of Math Exposition, which is a contest aimed at encouraging

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,100
more people to put up math explainers online, in whatever way they dream of doing that.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,680
A lot of them are videos, not all of them are videos.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,820
Every year we select some winners, but I say at every time the contest is not actually

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,520
about the winners, success looks like getting more good explanations online.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
Now last year in the winner announcement video I talked all about the specific criteria I

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,260
try to think about.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,560
I won't necessarily repeat that here, you can watch that one for all that.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,540
Instead I thought I'd just go down 25 different entries and say a couple of words on what

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,480
I like about each one.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,620
Before I dive in, I've got to be honest, I found it especially hard this year to actually

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,640
make the decisions for what constitutes an honorable mention, what constitutes a winner.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
And to be clear, I'm not the only one making decisions here, we have a whole bunch of guest

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,040
judges who helped, I'm really just assembling my own feedback on everyone else's.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,800
But nevertheless at some point you have to make a call that says this one is a winner,

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,240
this one is an honorable mention.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,680
And I think I realized one of the reasons that it was so hard is I don't think there's

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,360
such a thing as a generally good math explainer for a general audience.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,440
I think there's such a thing as a pretty good video for a general audience, and I think

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,360
there's such a thing as great videos for very specific audiences.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,400
And in some ways it's that second category that is where the internet really shines,

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,720
where you have something that maybe isn't perfectly tailored for everyone because it

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,440
can't be, but for that particular audience that it's great for, it's kind of the best

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,120
thing you could have asked for.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,000
And I'll actually give one example.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,920
So one of the entries that I want to showcase for you is called Pixel Art Anti-Aliasing.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,680
It's all about the task of taking a piece of two-dimensional really low resolution pixel

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,680
art, but displaying it in a three-dimensional potentially high resolution environment.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,820
I found it fascinating, and I think anyone who's really into computer graphics, and especially

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,900
anyone who enjoys shader programming, would find this completely fascinating.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,980
For that specific audience, I am very confident in saying, watch it, you'll enjoy it, you're

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,220
going to get something out of it.

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,140
Now this one does a good job of motivating the mathematical ideas that go into it, even

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,860
if you aren't necessarily into shader programming.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,900
But if I'm expanding the scope of who I might be recommending this to, to any generally

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,660
math curious internet goer, well, you know, that makes a couple assumptions for things

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,460
you might know about that maybe not everyone does.

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,300
And to be fair, omitting certain fundamentals is the correct choice for the target audience.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,420
Now the next entry, and by the way, I randomly sorted this list of content that I want to

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,420
go through ahead of time.

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,740
I'll talk about which ones were chosen as winners at the very end.

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,780
This next one is called The Math of Saving the Enola Gay.

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,020
So this is talking about the plane which dropped the nuclear bombs in World War II.

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,140
And the author acknowledges that there's some obvious moral questions associated with

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,460
the mission itself.

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,820
But the focus is on the surprisingly interesting physics question of the best route that the

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,980
plane should take after dropping the weapon to avoid paying potentially calamitous consequences

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,820
of the aftershock of the weapon itself.

49
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,340
And what I appreciate is that he really does go into the full detail of the problem itself.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,980
And this is the kind of video lecture I could imagine as being a really, really excellent

51
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,260
case study that you could use in a high school physics class or something like that.

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,940
It's a worked example that covers a lot of very fundamental ideas that you would need

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,420
for a class like that.

54
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,540
And whereas often on YouTube it can make sense to kind of skip over some of the heavier details

55
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,180
and mention that this is best left as an exercise to the viewer or something like that.

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,880
I really respect those who actually do step through all of the detail because that most

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,100
authentically reflects what the feeling of doing math is and the amount of time that

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
it can take.

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,060
So it's definitely something to watch when you're in the mood for details.

60
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,040
But when you are, it's excellent.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,180
Next up is Making a Pitch Shifter.

62
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,260
And so this is the technology that allows you to auto-tune and things like that.

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,180
And also it's an equivalent problem to how you speed up or slow down audio without changing

64
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
the pitch of it.

65
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,540
For example, I imagine a lot of you are watching this video at 1.5x or 2x.

66
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,840
And if you step back and think about what's required to make that work, it's actually

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,740
a very interesting question.

68
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,100
And this video goes through a lot of the different ways that you might think about it, some of

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,900
the initial approaches, quirks associated with those.

70
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,140
It shows the code that he's using along the way.

71
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,340
It's a great practical problem and who doesn't love a little more forte in their lives.

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,540
Next up we have a non-video entry.

73
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,340
This one is Cayley Graphs and Pretty Things.

74
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,380
This is another example where for the right audience, this is an excellent piece of content.

75
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,220
In this case, I think that audience would be students in group theory.

76
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,740
In particular, I think what it does an excellent job describing is the semi-direct product.

77
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,580
So it describes a lot of other things, but it builds up to this, which is a very specific

78
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,580
and kind of niche thing that a group theory student might come across.

79
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,620
Might be a little bit confusing in the book.

80
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,420
The way that everything is explained here gives a really satisfying mental image that

81
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,660
you can hold in your head for that, which is great.

82
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Ah, okay.

83
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,380
The next one is the longest increasing subsequence.

84
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,380
I talk about one of the things I'm looking for as being memorable pieces of content.

85
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,020
This channel definitely satisfies that because for the last three years, I remember the entries

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,020
that they put in.

87
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,500
They have a very particular style, a very distinctively clear way of talking about what

88
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,220
would usually be rather technical topics.

89
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,380
And here I'm envisioning the target audience as probably being the same kind of people

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,460
who would attend like a seminar in a math department, curious undergrads or some of

91
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,940
the grad students in the department.

92
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,380
Because it describes a problem which to be perfectly fair, you might not care about if

93
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,060
you're not already super into math.

94
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,740
It's talking about if you have a random permutation, what might you expect the longest increasing

95
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,140
subsequence in that permutation to be?

96
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,740
So a very natural, but very pure question.

97
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,100
The tactics brought to studying this are surprising, but really well motivated in the context of

98
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
the video.

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,260
And I think just really beautiful to think about.

100
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,180
Next up, we've got another non-video entry, the Matrix Arcade.

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,660
And this one, I think I remember in the peer review, might've gotten marked down a little

102
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,440
bit more than some of the others.

103
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,780
And I'm guessing it's because one of the things we mentioned looking for in any given

104
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,820
content piece is novelty.

105
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,620
And in terms of topic matter, this one covers a lot of the same things as the Essence of

106
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,460
Linear Algebra series that I made way back when.

107
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,080
But I do actually think this one is worth highlighting because even if there's overlap

108
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,460
in the subject matter, I think presenting it in this mode in an interactive way where

109
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,220
at the end you offer a playground that someone can go through.

110
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,520
And along the way, each idea is really well illustrated on the main screen and really

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,040
well described in the text on the right.

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,820
That adds something that I've wanted to see added to the space for a long time.

113
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,660
And I could absolutely see recommending this to teachers of linear algebra.

114
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,140
It's a great link that you can send to someone.

115
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,780
Next in my randomly sorted list of featured content is a video called Watching Neural

116
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,260
Networks Learn.

117
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,660
And on the one hand, it's very beautiful.

118
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,820
A lot of the imagery comes from a certain way to visualize the gradient descent process

119
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,220
or what the neural network can do during that process.

120
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,080
But the thing that really sold this for me was not so much the nice visuals, but there's

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,140
a really thought provoking discussion in here on the choices that you can make as you set

122
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,260
up the network and what different features you can use.

123
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,980
And in the context of learning a function that describes a two dimensional image, why

124
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,820
Fourier series in particular end up giving dramatically better results.

125
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,640
And I had never thought about this particular combination of ideas before and I thought

126
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,540
it was just really fascinating.

127
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,400
Next up, we've got an article, Functions are Vectors.

128
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,000
This is one of those topics that's just very important.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,520
There's a time in your life before you think about functions as vectors and there's a time

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,500
in your life after you think about functions as vectors.

131
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,860
And this article was just very thorough and well explained.

132
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,860
And I think it's one of the best resources out there to transition someone between those

133
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,100
two states.

134
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,520
Next up, we've got the Art of Linear Programming.

135
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,220
And this addresses a class of problems that come up in computer science and the algorithmic

136
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,900
way of thinking about a good way to solve them.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,940
And the approach that the author takes, which I always think is a very good one in any kind

138
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,700
of education, is to just start with one of the most simple, non-trivial examples that

139
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,180
you can have and really just working through what everything looks like in that context

140
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,460
as he then goes on to describe the more general or sometimes more constrained situations where

141
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,860
those similar ideas can apply.

142
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,240
It's well illustrated, the ideas along the way are well motivated, so just a bang up

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
job all around.

144
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,700
This next one is actually a little different.

145
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,640
It's called The Mosaic Problem, How and Why to Do Math for Fun.

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,380
So the author is describing a very specific question that they were once contemplating.

147
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,500
You know, I think a criticism that you could lay is that there's not a lot of motivation

148
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,080
for why you might care about the problem.

149
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,820
But that's not actually what the video is about.

150
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,580
He's really just using this as an example of what he calls a backburner problem.

151
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,200
And this is an idea that I think is very much worth getting into the minds of more math

152
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,040
students out there.

153
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,200
Essentially it's that if you have some sort of problem that you care about and you think

154
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,500
about, even if no one else does, as long as it's brought out your own curiosity, and when

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,580
you go into new math classes, you have that as a problem that you can kind of turn to

156
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,460
every now and then, it offers a fertile ground for adding context to a lot of math out there,

157
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,100
which is sometimes so desperately lacking a good context that motivates the students.

158
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,180
So for his particular question, this mosaic problem, he talks about how it made relevant

159
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,360
certain ideas like generating functions and principles of inclusion and exclusion.

160
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,260
And his broader point is not that this particular problem is the most important in the world,

161
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,400
but that having a backburner problem of some kind is actually one of the best ways to stay

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,860
engaged with math.

163
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,500
And that I would definitely agree with.

164
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,220
And I guess on the topic of problems which probably don't really matter, but are fun

165
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,940
to think about and end up being a path to some actually interesting math, the next one,

166
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,340
affording a planet with geometry, is I think the only claymation entry that I saw this

167
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,860
year used to good effect in describing a certain optimization problem, framed in the context

168
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,660
of deciding what shape you want to turn your planet into if you want to experience a certain

169
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,880
amount of gravity, but not use too much mass to do it.

170
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
It's well explained.

171
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,420
If you're into that kind of problem, definitely check it out.

172
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,720
Next up we've got when can't math be generalized, the limits of analytic continuation.

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,080
And thinking in terms of target audiences, anyone who's taking a complex analysis class,

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,240
this is outstanding, perfect for them.

175
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,060
Anyone who might have a complex analysis class in their future, I think this does a good

176
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,320
job setting up some of the ideas that you run across in that.

177
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,600
It's not talking about generalizing math in the sense of applying it to a general set

178
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
of circumstances, but in a setting where sometimes you can take a function defined

179
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,320
on one domain and extend that definition beyond it, there are circumstances where you actually

180
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
can't do that.

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,040
And he offers a really clear description of what exactly we mean by extending in this

182
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,660
context and then an example where you can't do that that seems like it's sort of dropped

183
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,980
in from out of the blue, but it gives a really satisfying reason for why this example would

184
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,240
have the properties that it does with some suggestion for how you might have come up

185
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
with that.

186
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,640
And the next step is just a very cute example of an argument in geometry.

187
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Some of you might have thought about this before, but if you translate something and

188
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,560
then rotate it, or maybe you rotate and then translate, it's always possible to express

189
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,320
the composite motion there as some kind of rotation about some point.

190
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,520
And of course, there's a slight caveat there where if you just translate it but rotate

191
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,020
it zero degrees, that's not the same as a rotation.

192
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,060
And this video offers just a really well illustrated proof of why that's the case.

193
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,780
And I think what stuck out to me is the way that the second half of the proof was framed

194
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,800
in terms of this kind of game that you're playing with a certain demon, which takes

195
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,660
what otherwise is maybe a little bit of a confusing set of logical steps that leads

196
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,500
to a contradiction, and instead just makes it a little easier to hold on to while you're

197
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,940
following all of the reasoning.

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,740
So I appreciated that.

199
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,100
Ah, so the next one, rethinking the real line.

200
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,820
I really liked this one, and it stood out from many others, for one thing just because

201
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,180
it felt very natural, like the presentation didn't feel like it was scripted or over-edited

202
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,180
in any way.

203
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,300
But what really shown is the subject matter.

204
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,060
And again, I think the sense in which it's great is for a particular target audience.

205
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,120
So in this case, if you've ever thought about visualizing rational numbers or rational approximations

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,740
of irrational numbers, it offers just a really dense set of very nice ideas for how to think

207
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,320
about these topics.

208
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,700
And they're all connected with each other very nicely.

209
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,620
And I, for one, felt like I came out of it armed with a few more mental constructs for

210
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,620
how to think about a few of these ideas, which is, of course, just such a nice feeling.

211
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,280
All right, next we've got how did the ancient Egyptians find this volume without algebra?

212
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,380
So this is a question which is interesting in terms of the history of math or what you

213
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,460
can do without certain ideas that we take for granted.

214
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,600
So the problem at hand is how you find the volume of essentially a pyramid where you

215
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,380
cut off the top of it.

216
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,260
The author talks about how the Egyptians had this formula for it, which is, of course,

217
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,760
not written algebraically.

218
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,540
People didn't think algebraically back then.

219
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,620
But he addresses how it's actually very surprising to get to that formula if you don't think

220
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,080
algebraically.

221
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,300
And so tries to address the problem of how might you find this idea as a algorithm for

222
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,160
finding the volume not expressed as a formula without being able to manipulate the formulas

223
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,200
that you or I would naturally manipulate to land on that idea.

224
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,260
This next one, I think, has one of the best hooks of any of the ones that I've seen before.

225
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,360
So he essentially asks if you're swinging a ball on a rope above your head, and then

226
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,480
at some point you release the rope, you let go of the rope, what happens to the ball with

227
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,800
the three possibilities that it continues on the circular path, that it continues on

228
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,260
the straight line path tangent to the circle, or it goes on this straight path away from

229
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,780
the circle.

230
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,380
And I guess I'll just say it's not the answer that most people say it is.

231
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,260
And he does, I think, a really good job laying out the intuition for why that's not the case,

232
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,080
and then demonstrating it experimentally.

233
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,140
Also on the more physics-oriented side of things, we have the math of bubbles, minimal

234
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,020
surfaces and the calculus of variations.

235
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,540
So again, there's a great hook here where the problem at hand is to understand the shape

236
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,740
of the surface that you get if you take two cylindrical boundaries and then form a bubble

237
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,700
in between them, where the relevant physics at play is that bubbles try to have the minimal

238
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,220
surface area that they can subject to some kind of boundary conditions.

239
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,640
The way to solve this problem is to bring in something known as the calculus of variations.

240
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,420
It's very important in other contexts.

241
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,120
For example, if any of you have ever heard of Lagrangian mechanics, and the author here

242
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,540
describes the general framework used for not just this problem, but a wide category of

243
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,780
problems and works through it for this particular case.

244
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,160
Again, it's one of those where to get the most out of it, you've got to be in the mood

245
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,580
for some details.

246
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,540
And in this one, he does leave a lot of room to kind of pause and think through things

247
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,720
where if certain steps are something you might have thought about before, you don't have

248
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,340
to linger on it too much.

249
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,560
But definitely if it's the first time you're going through any calculus of variation example,

250
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,040
it is something you kind of need to stop and digest for a bit.

251
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,780
And he leaves the room for that, which is nice.

252
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,800
Next up is another non-video entry, which I think is a really just perfect example for

253
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,020
any calculus 2 class out there.

254
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,620
Any teachers looking to pull in something, I think this is a really great resource.

255
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,020
The question is very simply, how do computers calculate logarithms?

256
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,300
What happens when you're clicking that button?

257
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,980
He goes into things like Taylor series, but then perhaps more importantly, why the simple

258
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,740
naive Taylor series approach here doesn't necessarily get you something as good as you

259
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,840
might want.

260
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,440
That last step is really well motivated, really well described.

261
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,820
So if you're curious, go take a look.

262
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,980
Next on the docket, we have what happens if you add fractions incorrectly?

263
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,340
So if you ask elementary schoolers to add fractions together, there's kind of this instinct

264
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,980
to just add the numerators and add the denominators.

265
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,080
If that's happening, it's probably a sign that the student doesn't appreciate what's

266
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,180
actually being represented or that the rules of math actually have a reason for them.

267
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,260
And you need to think through those reasons.

268
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,140
But the funny thing is that operation, which is not adding fractions, is actually the start

269
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,020
of a surprisingly far ranging set of ideas in other parts of math.

270
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,680
It has a special name, it's known as the mediant.

271
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,320
The author essentially walks through this pretty wide space of different things that

272
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,160
this seemingly arbitrary operation can lead you to.

273
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,500
It's actually pretty connected with the one we were talking about a couple minutes ago

274
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,240
on reimagining the reals, things like rational approximations.

275
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,440
It also talks about Dirichlet's theorem.

276
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,680
Forward circles are in there, who doesn't love a good forward circle?

277
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,760
So if you're curious about the meandering set of ideas that you can be led to here,

278
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,400
definitely do take a look.

279
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Next we've got, can you guess a shape from its shadows?

280
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
So maybe you've thought about this kind of problem before.

281
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,360
If you take a 3D shape and you look at its shadow from one direction, shadow from another,

282
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,040
and then shadow from a third, can you reconstruct what that shape is?

283
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,080
And he mentions a seemingly obvious example where all three of those shadows are squares,

284
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,880
so you think the answer is a cube, but it's actually dramatically more interesting than

285
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
a cube.

286
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,560
And he talks about the set of shapes that you can get from this.

287
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,360
Ah, okay, so the next one, stylistically, is one of the most distinct of all of them,

288
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,560
which I always appreciate, especially if I'm going through hundreds of different explainers

289
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,400
and trying to make a decision.

290
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,160
At first when I was watching this, I was like, wait, what's going on here?

291
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,280
Why is he just kind of like walking around in a bunch of different places?

292
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,760
But he has this really kind of calming way of incorporating a bunch of different environments

293
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,680
and nature into these otherwise sometimes pretty technical descriptions of what he's

294
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
talking about.

295
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,440
And the topic matter, broadly speaking, is fixed point theorems.

296
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,080
So this is one where I can imagine the target audience being like a math major or someone

297
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,720
who has reason to care about fixed point theorems.

298
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
And as it goes on, he does get into some real depth of it.

299
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,160
We're closing in now towards the end of my randomly sorted list of featured videos.

300
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
I guess the next one is not actually a video.

301
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,100
I keep saying video is a generic stand in for content.

302
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,080
But the next one is an article describing how computers represent numbers, in particular

303
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
floating point numbers.

304
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,040
And I've seen other explainers for floating point representations out there before, but

305
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
I think this is the best one that I've seen.

306
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,720
And I really appreciate the approach that he takes, which is to have you imagine that

307
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,600
you want to represent them and go through a refined set of ideas where each one is not

308
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,980
quite what the final answer ends up being, but motivates the next step in a nice way.

309
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,440
This genre of discovery fiction, I think works especially well when you have topics that

310
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,560
seem like they have a lot of arbitrary or unexpected choices along the way.

311
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
It's just really well explained.

312
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
I liked it a lot.

313
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,500
All right, next on the list, we've got mathematical magic mirror ball.

314
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
Say that five times fast.

315
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,360
Essentially describing how if you take a picture of a spherical mirror, you can use that image

316
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,820
to reconstruct a 360 degree view of the room all around it.

317
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,760
And he described how that works, what it's used for, what the trade offs are all around

318
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,580
just a great application of a pretty surprising phenomenon.

319
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,180
All right, this penultimate one on my list is just actually kind of amazing.

320
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,660
The person built this machine, which will weave a string along a whole bunch of pegs

321
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,660
around a circle, such that as those strings intersect very densely at some points to make

322
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,820
it dark and very sparsely at others to make it light, you can reconstruct an image.

323
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,500
That's just amazing that such a thing is possible.

324
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,760
And the author describes the process for how this was made and the various ideas that he

325
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,060
tried, the reasons that they didn't work.

326
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,320
It both motivates a lot of mathematical ideas, while also acknowledging that sometimes the

327
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,900
thing that seems like very clever, pure math that you're bringing in to address a problem

328
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,160
just isn't actually very effective.

329
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,120
And that what's more important when you're applying math to the world is to find the

330
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,940
right framing of the problem in the first place.

331
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,420
And this is just a lesson I think is worth emphasizing a little bit more in math, that

332
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,780
rather than trying to find a better solution to a particular problem, you want to instead

333
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,580
ask whether the problem that you're solving is actually the right problem to be solving.

334
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,900
And then last but not least on my list here is another one that I just recognize the author

335
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,260
immediately because it's such a distinctive style that I've seen in the last two years,

336
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,700
where the topic matter broadly speaking is infinity.

337
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,860
What exactly does one mean by that?

338
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,420
Like everything on this channel, it is unreasonably beautifully illustrated.

339
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,900
And in just 20 minutes, you know, he hits on a lot of the really big important ideas

340
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,620
around what exactly infinity means and how those ideas all relate to each other.

341
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,880
So that's a wrap for the ones that I wanted to mention right now and highlight to you.

342
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,340
There are many more, of course, that were submitted and quite a few that are worth looking

343
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,260
at even if I didn't mention them here.

344
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,580
Again, I do think what makes the judging here at the end so hard is that what makes something

345
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,620
good is usually the sense in which it's good for a very specific audience and trying to

346
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,820
come up with any notion of how to rank all of these against each other in an objective

347
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
way.

348
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,540
And for the different target audiences, it's just an apples to oranges comparison.

349
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,860
With all of that said, the ones selected as winners, the ones collecting the golden pie

350
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,460
creature prizes, are the mathematics of string art, minimal surfaces and the calculus of

351
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,660
variations, rethinking the real line, pixel art anti-aliasing, and from the non-video

352
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,540
category, how computers use numbers.

353
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,920
So evidently, shortly after this point in the recording, my camera battery died, which

354
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,840
I guess is almost perfect timing.

355
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,760
I do want to close out though by saying a really big thanks to James Schloss for all

356
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,640
the organization and helping to make this happen, to Fred Crozetier for the web development

357
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,480
and putting together a new peer review system, which made everything this year just much,

358
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,020
much smoother, and many, many thanks to the kind folks at Jane Street for providing the

359
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,640
funding both for the prizes associated with the winners and honorable mentions, and also

360
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,160
with other costs associated with running the event.

361
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
Also, at the end of August, a ton of you participated in the peer review process, and I really just

362
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
want to say thank you for donating your time to doing that.

363
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,920
And then of course, thank you to everybody who made some kind of math explainer for the

364
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
event.

365
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,560
There are many really good ones that I didn't have the time to talk about in this video.

366
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,280
In the description you'll find a link to a playlist for all the video entries, and

367
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,560
then on the website we'll include a list of all the non-video entries.

368
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,000
So do check them out, I can almost guarantee that if you scroll through and see what you're

369
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,480
interested in, you'll find some hidden gems in there.
