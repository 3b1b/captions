1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
It's honestly an honor to be here. Many thanks to the faculty for including me.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,720
Welcome to all of the parents and the friends who were able to come and more

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,380
than anything congratulations to the class of 2023. I was sitting essentially

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,760
where you are right now about eight years ago. I was receiving the same

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,260
degree and in the time since then I devoted myself to trying to share math

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,240
with others mainly through YouTube but also through some other avenues and what

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,520
I want to talk to you about today is a small way that my relationship with math

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,680
has changed during that time and a way that I hope that it continues to change.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,000
The change is personal but it's something that might just apply to you

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,360
too and if so it might actually help in shaping your future. I was reflecting

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,240
before today on what it was that pulled me into the subject in the first place.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,080
Why is it that I fell in love with the subject? Why is it that I chose to major

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,760
in it when I was here? Why is it that I've spent the last eight years in this

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,240
sort of weird unorthodox career path of explaining it online? And you see there's

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,480
a story that I think a lot of us tell and the story is centered on things like

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,240
the inescapable beauty of the subject or the fact that it's very charming just

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,560
how well applied it is to not just physics and not just computer science

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
but a plethora of different technical fields. But that story at least for me

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,440
would gloss over another factor that might be just as influential but which

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,440
is a lot more awkward to talk about. Ego. I don't know if you remember what it was

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,440
like to be a child. If you remember what it was like maybe in elementary school

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,520
and the way it came across to us. If I look back to my earliest memories of

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,080
math I think I was very lucky because it felt to me like a game and I think this

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,080
had to do with how my dad would present it to me. But in the context of school it

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,220
had a very different character. It felt competitive. I don't think this was the

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,640
intention of the teachers. I don't think it was the intention of any of the

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,480
adults around. But there was a certain unspoken assumption that the subject was

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,440
supposed to be hard. That many of us were going to struggle with it. And no

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,480
doubt thanks to the games that I would play with my dad I was one of the

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,000
fortunate ones who found it a little bit easier. And because I found it a little

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,800
bit easier I think I came to like the subject not because it was beautiful and

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,040
not because it was useful and not even because it was playful but frankly

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,800
because of that childish self-satisfaction that comes from

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,640
feeling like you're doing well at something that the adults tell you

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,360
you're supposed to be doing well at. And for a long time in school this sort of

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,880
kicked off a positive feedback loop. I spent a lot of time with the subject

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,000
because I liked it. I liked it because I felt good at it. And to the extent that I

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,760
actually wasn't any good at it it was because I was spending so much time with

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,640
it. And I don't want to suggest that this is true for everyone who likes math and

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,260
I also don't want to suggest that this is the the kind of loop that doesn't

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,200
have struggles involved with it. Because there absolutely are struggles any way

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,080
that you learn math. It's more that if I'm honest the forces that kept me

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
pushing through some of the struggles and putting in the time and the practice

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,320
and the effort that's necessary to get better at the subject were at least in

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,920
part motivated by a desire to be seen as being good at it. And you know I was a

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,140
teenager it's hard to escape a little bit of ego but ego is an awkward motive

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,160
to talk about. And if I'm fair the beauty in the application really did play some

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,160
role. It's not like they weren't there at all but they came in a lot later. Because

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,880
of this positive feedback loop I was spending time in the subject I would

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,200
chat with my teachers after school about it. I would go to local math circles

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,000
events. I learned what a mathematician was. I would read books about problem

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
solving. And in that kind of immersion it's hard not to fall in love with the

53
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,240
actual beauty of the subject. So even if the passion began for these slightly

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,840
more self-centered and slightly more childish reasons that started to give

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,880
away to something a little bit purer something more like an aesthetic sense

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,640
something a little more outward focused. It's a little like a fossil where you

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,920
know the organic molecules slowly start to give way for a longer term sturdier

58
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,400
mineral that'll be there be there to the end. For me it became a little bit

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,720
less about perceived success and a little bit more about the subject itself.

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,000
But that's not actually the change that I want to talk to you about. This shift

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,640
in motivation the fossilization process probably happened maybe towards the end

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,680
of high school started my time here at Stanford. But what I want to talk about

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,500
is how analogous to the way that the new minerals of a fossil still take on the

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,880
same general shape as the original bone. I think there might have been some

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,040
lingering after effects associated with the less pure original motivations for

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,640
the subject. See while I was here at Stanford I remember a lot of my peers

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,040
would use the word interesting. Now why is it that you chose to go to that

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
internship that you did this summer or why did you choose to work with this

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,640
professor that you did? Oh it seemed like they were working on very interesting

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,040
problems. But what does the word interesting mean? Interesting to whom? I

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,000
think if I was to look back on myself and how I was using the word at least

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,440
part of what I meant by it was that a problem seemed hard. It seemed

73
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,840
recognizably hard but not so hard that I couldn't sink my teeth into it a little

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,680
bit. Utility had a strange backseat for me and it really was about the challenge

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,160
in and of itself. And I don't think this was just me. If we fast forward by the

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,400
time I was making YouTube videos for a long time one of the most popular videos

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,880
on the channel was one that had the title the hardest problem on the hardest

78
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,240
test which admittedly is blatant clickbait. And it was about a problem

79
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
from the Putnam and between you and me it wasn't really the hardest problem

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,240
that the Putnam's ever shown but it was positioned as number six. But if we think

81
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,600
about the fact that it was clickbait why would that work? Why is it that something

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,320
on the order of 10 million people outside the usual subscriber base were

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,540
curious to click on a topic not because it was beautiful or not because it

84
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,400
promised anything useful but merely because it promised that something was

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,680
challenging. Now to be fair sometimes difficulty does correspond with

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,400
something that's useful maybe there's a field that's blocked by a puzzle that

87
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
nobody knows how to solve and if someone could solve it it would unlock more

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,400
utility in that field. But the question is whether the reason for caring about

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,680
the problem fundamentally was about that utility or if it was about the fact that

90
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,720
it's widely recognized to be challenging and because of what that might imply for

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,640
the person who does solve it and how they might be perceived. So I'll give you

92
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,160
another example for where you know origins of a slightly more youthful and

93
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,920
competitive spirited motivation for math might have had these lingering after

94
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,020
effects even after that motivation was no longer the dominant one. When I

95
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,800
started making videos about math I was actually a senior here at Stanford when

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
I very first began I was uploading them to a channel that I had given the very

97
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,920
strange name of three blue and brown and at that time I cared a lot about the

98
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,360
content seeming very different from traditional lessons out there. I cared a

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
lot that it was showing something students wouldn't see in the usual

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,040
linear track of school and I think I cared a lot about being perceived as

101
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,240
providing something that was original something that was distinct. Now if we

102
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,280
contrast this after I graduated I spent time working at Khan Academy and there

103
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,280
the goal was very explicitly to make content that met students where they are

104
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,080
then. I made a couple hundred pieces of content mostly centered around

105
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,720
multivariable calculus and I was choosing topics not based on originality or a

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
desire to stand out more than anything I was choosing topics simply because

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,000
they were on the list of what students had asked to know about what they needed

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,140
to know and the feedback in both categories of these videos was positive

109
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,680
but with a different character and one of them was a lot deeper. Those on early

110
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,520
three blue and brown felt like people watching a shared sport something that

111
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,320
we all enjoyed watching together but those on Khan Academy had a very

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,880
different flavor they were characterized more than anything by gratitude. I felt

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,560
that I actually helped people and they found them genuinely useful. So later on

114
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,920
on three blue and brown I started to prioritize lessons that met learners

115
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,240
where they were. I did a series about linear algebra I did a series about

116
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,920
calculus people asked if I could explain what is a Fourier transform or how do

117
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,680
neural networks work and so I obliged. Now the topics weren't original you know

118
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
there's lots and lots of other videos and pieces of content online that

119
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,760
explained those but these are by far the ones that have received the most

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,800
gratitude in that time and which have accounted for any success that I've

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
found since then. There's always room for novelty in the specific approach after a

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,880
topic is chosen but the thing that took me an embarrassingly long time to really

123
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,920
learn the lesson that took a long time to genuinely sink in is that when topics

124
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,040
are chosen primarily because of how they'll help people and concerns like

125
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,720
novelty and originality and whether something is capital I interesting are

126
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,160
all relevant only insofar as they help the goal of meeting a learner where they

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,640
are. That's when the reach feels genuinely meaningful and for what it's

128
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,400
worth I do think that shift in focus is probably what made the difference

129
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,840
between videos being a hobby and videos being a career. Now for every one of you

130
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,400
who's sitting here right now whatever it is that you choose to do moving forward

131
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,000
with the math that you've learned here and the other skills that you've learned

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,840
here the future fulfillment that you derive from that work is going to have

133
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,480
as much to do with how you evaluate what's worth working on as it does with

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,360
the strengths that you're bringing to the table. The future mark that your work

135
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,040
leaves on the world has as much to do with how you're evaluating what you're

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,440
working on as it does anything else and my advice to you right now and you're at

137
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,800
this very pivotal juncture in your life is to be especially mindful of where

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,480
that evaluation function comes from. If after today you're going into industry

139
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,360
you might ask yourself how are you choosing where to work? How did you

140
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,080
choose who to work with? How are you choosing what to build? If you are going

141
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,880
into academia ask yourself if it's for the right reasons and how you'll choose

142
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
which problems to work on. How much of it depends on the way that you'll be

143
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
perceived for solving the problems and how much depends on the value that other

144
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,200
people will find from it. Now if you're going into teaching, well honestly if

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
you're going into teaching you're probably wiser than the rest of us so I

146
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
don't have much to say. See in the last eight years I felt a shift in my own

147
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,640
evaluation function. Hardness in and of itself that doesn't cut it. Originality

148
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,560
for its own sake is hollow and math still has an intrinsic beauty but

149
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,520
honestly these days that beauty is all the more potent if there's at least a

150
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,800
whisper of something genuinely useful in sight. I can't tell you what the right

151
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,600
evaluation function is for you. I can suggest that it probably will matter

152
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,840
more when it depends less on yourself and it depends a little bit more on

153
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,320
others and what you're doing for them but what I am sure of is that time spent

154
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,520
right now today seriously reassessing where the evaluation function comes from

155
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,840
stands to make your future richer. So congratulations once again all of us

156
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,960
