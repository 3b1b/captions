1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,940
It's honestly an honor to be here.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,340
Many thanks to the faculty for including me.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,559
Welcome to all of the parents and the friends who were able to 

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,200
come and more than anything congratulations to the class of 2023.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,280
I was sitting essentially where you are right now about eight years ago.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,028
I was receiving the same degree and in the time since then I devoted myself to trying 

7
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:27,325
to share math with others mainly through YouTube but also through some other avenues 

8
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:31,572
and what I want to talk to you about today is a small way that my relationship with 

9
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:35,820
math has changed during that time and a way that I hope that it continues to change.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,128
The change is personal but it's something that might just apply 

11
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:41,880
to you too and if so it might actually help in shaping your future.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,061
I was reflecting before today on what it was that 

13
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,400
pulled me into the subject in the first place.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,780
Why is it that I fell in love with the subject?

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,100
Why is it that I chose to major in it when I was here?

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,224
Why is it that I've spent the last eight years in this sort 

17
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,880
of weird unorthodox career path of explaining it online?

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,432
And you see there's a story that I think a lot of us tell and the story is 

19
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,917
centered on things like the inescapable beauty of the subject or the fact 

20
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:09,307
that it's very charming just how well applied it is to not just physics 

21
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,840
and not just computer science but a plethora of different technical fields.

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,369
But that story at least for me would gloss over another factor that 

23
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,240
might be just as influential but which is a lot more awkward to talk about.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,160
Ego.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,360
I don't know if you remember what it was like to be a child.

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,248
If you remember what it was like maybe in elementary 

27
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:29,840
school and the way it came across to us.

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,240
If I look back to my earliest memories of math I think I was very lucky because it felt 

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,040
to me like a game and I think this had to do with how my dad would present it to me.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,200
But in the context of school it had a very different character.

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700
It felt competitive.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,100
I don't think this was the intention of the teachers.

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,380
I don't think it was the intention of any of the adults around.

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,420
But there was a certain unspoken assumption that the subject was supposed to be hard.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,620
That many of us were going to struggle with it.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,818
And no doubt thanks to the games that I would play with my dad 

37
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,520
I was one of the fortunate ones who found it a little bit easier.

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,933
And because I found it a little bit easier I think I came to like the subject not because 

39
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:10,315
it was beautiful and not because it was useful and not even because it was playful but 

40
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:14,698
frankly because of that childish self-satisfaction that comes from feeling like you're 

41
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:18,980
doing well at something that the adults tell you you're supposed to be doing well at.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,840
And for a long time in school this sort of kicked off a positive feedback loop.

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,840
I spent a lot of time with the subject because I liked it.

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,000
I liked it because I felt good at it.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,102
And to the extent that I actually wasn't any good at 

46
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,000
it it was because I was spending so much time with it.

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,375
And I don't want to suggest that this is true for everyone who 

48
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,946
likes math and I also don't want to suggest that this is the 

49
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,560
the kind of loop that doesn't have struggles involved with it.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,980
Because there absolutely are struggles any way that you learn math.

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,477
It's more that if I'm honest the forces that kept me pushing through some of the 

52
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:51,964
struggles and putting in the time and the practice and the effort that's necessary to get 

53
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:56,251
better at the subject were at least in part motivated by a desire to be seen as being 

54
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:56,800
good at it.

55
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,269
And you know I was a teenager it's hard to escape a little 

56
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,840
bit of ego but ego is an awkward motive to talk about.

57
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,313
And if I'm fair the beauty in the application really did play some role 

58
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:09,240
it's not like they weren't there at all but they came in a lot later.

59
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,340
Because of this positive feedback loop I was spending time in 

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,880
the subject I would chat with my teachers after school about it.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
I would go to local math circles events.

62
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,540
I learned what a mathematician was.

63
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,108
I would read books about problem solving and in that kind of immersion 

64
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,220
it's hard not to fall in love with the actual beauty of the subject.

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,648
So even if the passion began for these slightly more self-centered and slightly 

66
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:33,377
more childish reasons that started to give away to something a little bit purer 

67
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:37,060
something more like an aesthetic sense something a little more outward focused.

68
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,480
It's a little like a fossil where you know the organic molecules slowly start to 

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,180
give way for a longer term sturdier mineral that'll be there be there to the end.

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,157
For me it became a little bit less about perceived 

71
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,700
success and a little bit more about the subject itself.

72
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,280
But that's not actually the change that I want to talk to you about.

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,042
This shift in motivation the fossilization process probably happened 

74
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:01,840
maybe towards the end of high school started my time here at Stanford.

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,507
But what I want to talk about is how analogous to the way that the new 

76
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:10,500
minerals of a fossil still take on the same general shape as the original bone.

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,515
I think there might have been some lingering after effects 

78
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:16,600
associated with the less pure original motivations for the subject.

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,301
See while I was here at Stanford I remember a 

80
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,040
lot of my peers would use the word interesting.

81
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,164
Now why is it that you chose to go to that internship that you did this 

82
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,600
summer or why did you choose to work with this professor that you did?

83
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh it seemed like they were working on very interesting problems.

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,720
But what does the word interesting mean?

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,200
Interesting to whom?

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
I think if I was to look back on myself and how I was using the word 

87
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,600
at least part of what I meant by it was that a problem seemed hard.

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,933
It seemed recognizably hard but not so hard that 

89
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,500
I couldn't sink my teeth into it a little bit.

90
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,978
Utility had a strange backseat for me and it really 

91
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:53,760
was about the challenge in and of itself.

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,740
And I don't think this was just me.

93
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,769
If we fast forward by the time I was making YouTube videos for a long time 

94
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:03,593
one of the most popular videos on the channel was one that had the title 

95
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:07,680
the hardest problem on the hardest test which admittedly is blatant clickbait.

96
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,286
And it was about a problem from the Putnam and between you and me it wasn't really 

97
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:16,000
the hardest problem that the Putnam's ever shown but it was positioned as number six.

98
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,180
But if we think about the fact that it was clickbait why would that work?

99
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,161
Why is it that something on the order of 10 million people outside the usual subscriber 

100
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:29,489
base were curious to click on a topic not because it was beautiful or not because it 

101
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:33,920
promised anything useful but merely because it promised that something was challenging.

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,753
Now to be fair sometimes difficulty does correspond with something that's useful 

103
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:43,301
maybe there's a field that's blocked by a puzzle that nobody knows how to solve 

104
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,540
and if someone could solve it it would unlock more utility in that field.

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,109
But the question is whether the reason for caring about the problem 

106
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:53,392
fundamentally was about that utility or if it was about the fact that 

107
00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:56,769
it's widely recognized to be challenging and because of what that might 

108
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:00,100
imply for the person who does solve it and how they might be perceived.

109
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,802
So I'll give you another example for where you know origins of a slightly more 

110
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:08,297
youthful and competitive spirited motivation for math might have had these 

111
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:12,120
lingering after effects even after that motivation was no longer the dominant one.

112
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,925
When I started making videos about math I was actually a senior here at Stanford 

113
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,726
when I very first began I was uploading them to a channel that I had given 

114
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:24,628
the very strange name of three blue and brown and at that time I cared a lot 

115
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:28,480
about the content seeming very different from traditional lessons out there.

116
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,186
I cared a lot that it was showing something students wouldn't see in the 

117
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:35,822
usual linear track of school and I think I cared a lot about being perceived 

118
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:39,080
as providing something that was original something that was distinct.

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,164
Now if we contrast this after I graduated I spent time working at Khan Academy and 

120
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:48,780
there the goal was very explicitly to make content that met students where they are then.

121
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,432
I made a couple hundred pieces of content mostly centered around multivariable calculus 

122
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:57,549
and I was choosing topics not based on originality or a desire to stand out more than 

123
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:01,618
anything I was choosing topics simply because they were on the list of what students 

124
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:05,831
had asked to know about what they needed to know and the feedback in both categories of 

125
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:10,140
these videos was positive but with a different character and one of them was a lot deeper.

126
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,012
Those on early three blue and brown felt like people watching a shared sport 

127
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:18,936
something that we all enjoyed watching together but those on Khan Academy had 

128
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:22,960
a very different flavor they were characterized more than anything by gratitude.

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,160
I felt that I actually helped people and they found them genuinely useful.

130
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,144
So later on on three blue and brown I started to 

131
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:32,400
prioritize lessons that met learners where they were.

132
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,702
I did a series about linear algebra I did a series about calculus people asked if I 

133
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:40,820
could explain what is a Fourier transform or how do neural networks work and so I obliged.

134
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,001
Now the topics weren't original you know there's lots and lots of 

135
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:48,414
other videos and pieces of content online that explained those but 

136
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:51,827
these are by far the ones that have received the most gratitude in 

137
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:55,800
that time and which have accounted for any success that I've found since then.

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,463
There's always room for novelty in the specific approach after a topic is chosen 

139
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:04,859
but the thing that took me an embarrassingly long time to really learn the lesson 

140
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,363
that took a long time to genuinely sink in is that when topics are chosen primarily 

141
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,706
because of how they'll help people and concerns like novelty and originality and 

142
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:18,049
whether something is capital I interesting are all relevant only insofar as they 

143
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:22,232
help the goal of meeting a learner where they are that's when the reach feels 

144
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:26,467
genuinely meaningful and for what it's worth I do think that shift in focus is 

145
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:31,240
probably what made the difference between videos being a hobby and videos being a career.

146
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,529
Now for every one of you who's sitting here right now whatever it is that you 

147
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:39,058
choose to do moving forward with the math that you've learned here and the 

148
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:42,680
other skills that you've learned here the future fulfillment that you derive 

149
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,209
from that work is going to have as much to do with how you evaluate what's 

150
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,020
worth working on as it does with the strengths that you're bringing to the table.

151
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,869
The future mark that your work leaves on the world has as much to do with 

152
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:58,858
how you're evaluating what you're working on as it does anything else and 

153
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:02,955
my advice to you right now and you're at this very pivotal juncture in your 

154
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:07,160
life is to be especially mindful of where that evaluation function comes from.

155
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,209
If after today you're going into industry you might 

156
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,600
ask yourself how are you choosing where to work?

157
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,320
How did you choose who to work with?

158
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,640
How are you choosing what to build?

159
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,199
If you are going into academia ask yourself if it's for the 

160
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,320
right reasons and how you'll choose which problems to work on.

161
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,430
How much of it depends on the way that you'll be perceived for solving the 

162
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,960
problems and how much depends on the value that other people will find from it.

163
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,684
Now if you're going into teaching, well honestly if you're going into 

164
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:36,940
teaching you're probably wiser than the rest of us so I don't have much to say.

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,420
See in the last eight years I felt a shift in my own evaluation function.

166
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,780
Hardness in and of itself that doesn't cut it.

167
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,885
Originality for its own sake is hollow and math still has an intrinsic 

168
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:52,409
beauty but honestly these days that beauty is all the more potent if 

169
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,780
there's at least a whisper of something genuinely useful in sight.

170
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,500
I can't tell you what the right evaluation function is for you.

171
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,459
I can suggest that it probably will matter more when it depends less on yourself 

172
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,598
and it depends a little bit more on others and what you're doing for them but 

173
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:12,579
what I am sure of is that time spent right now today seriously reassessing 

174
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,560
where the evaluation function comes from stands to make your future richer.

175
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,100
So congratulations once again.

176
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,339
All of us here are anxiously awaiting what that 

177
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,120
future looks like for each and every one of you.
