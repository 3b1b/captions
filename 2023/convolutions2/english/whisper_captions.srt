1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Let's kick things off with a quiz. Suppose I take a normal distribution with this familiar bell curve shape,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,700
and I have a random variable x that's drawn from that distribution.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,540
So what you're looking at right now are repeated samples of that random variable.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,000
And as a quick reminder, the way that you interpret this curve, what the function actually means,

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,920
is that if you want the probability that your sample falls within a given range of values,

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
say the probability that it ends up between negative one and two,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,700
well that would equal the area under this curve in that range of values. That's what the curve actually means.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,280
I'll also pull up a second random variable, also following a normal distribution,

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,980
but maybe this time a little more spread out, a slightly bigger standard deviation.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,080
And here's the quiz for you. If you repeatedly sample both of these variables,

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,420
and at each iteration you add up the two results, well then that sum behaves like its own random variable.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,880
And the question is what distribution describes that sum that you're looking at?

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,460
You think about it for a little moment, maybe you have a guess, maybe you think,

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,500
I don't know, it's another normal distribution, or something with a different shape.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,260
Needless to say, guessing is not enough. The real quiz is to be able to explain why you get the answer that you do.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,720
In this case, if you have that deep to your bones visceral level of understanding for why the answer is what it is,

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,260
you'll be a long way towards understanding why normal distributions serve the special function that they do in probability.

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,020
Zooming out though, this is actually meant to be a much more general lesson about how you add two different random variables,

19
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,360
regardless of their distribution, not necessarily just the normally distributed ones.

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,440
This amounts to a special operation that you apply to the distributions underlying those variables.

21
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,520
The operation has a special name, it's called a convolution,

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,640
and the primary thing you and I will do today is motivate and build up two distinct ways to visualize

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,700
what a convolution looks like for continuous functions,

24
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,700
and then to talk about how these two different visualizations can each be helpful in different ways,

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,100
with a special focus on the central limit theorem.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,660
After we do the general lesson, I want to return to the opening quiz and offer an unusually satisfying way to answer it.

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,680
As a quick side note, regular viewers among you might know there's already a video about convolutions on this channel,

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,580
but that one had a pretty different focus.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,320
We were only doing the discrete case, and I wanted to show not just probability,

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,100
but the ways that it comes up in a wide variety of contexts.

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm in a slightly awkward spot because it doesn't really make sense for that to be a prerequisite to this video,

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,540
but I think the best way to warm up today is to cover essentially one of the same examples used in that video,

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,380
so if you are coming straight from that one, you can probably skip safely ahead,

34
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,900
otherwise, let's dive right in.

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,300
For this opening quiz question, each of the random variables can take on a value in a continuous infinite range of values,

36
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,780
all possible real numbers.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,780
It'll be a lot easier if we warm up in a setting that's more discrete and finite, like maybe rolling a pair of weighted dice.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,600
Here, the animation you're looking at is simulating two weighted dice, and you can probably tell what's going on,

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,640
but just to spell it out explicitly, the blue die is following a distribution that seems to be biased towards lower values,

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:23,140
the red die has a distinct distribution, and I'm repeatedly sampling from each one and recording the sum of the two values at each iteration.

41
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,700
Repeating samples like this many many different times can give you a heuristic sense of the final distribution,

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,600
but our real task today is to compute that distribution precisely.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,360
What is the precise probability of rolling a 2, or a 3, or a 4, or a 5, on and on for all possibilities?

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,140
It's not too hard a question, I'd actually encourage you to pause and try working it out for yourself.

45
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,640
The main goal in this warm-up section will be to walk through two distinct ways that you could visualize the underlying computation.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,680
For example, one way you could start to think about it is that there are 36 distinct possible outcomes,

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,360
and we could organize those outcomes in a little 6x6 grid.

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,880
Now if I was to ask you, what is the probability of seeing any one of these specific outcomes,

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,500
say the probability of seeing a blue 4 and a red 2, what would you say?

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,240
We might say it should be the probability of that blue 4 multiplied by the probability of the red 2,

51
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,080
and that would be correct assuming that the die rolls are independent from each other.

52
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,420
You might say that's kind of pedantic, of course the die rolls should be independent from each other,

53
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,100
but it's a point worth emphasizing because everything that we're going to do from here moving forward,

54
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,240
from this simple example all the way up to the central limit theorem,

55
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,080
assumes that the random variables are independent.

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,720
In the real world, you want to keep a sharp eye out for if this assumption actually holds.

57
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,820
Now what I'm going to do is take this grid of all possible outcomes, but start filling it in with some numbers.

58
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,900
Maybe we'll put the numbers for all the probabilities of the blue die down on the bottom,

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,740
all the probabilities for the red die over here on the left,

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,640
and then we will fill in the grid where the probability for every outcome inside the grid

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,180
looks like some product between one number from the blue distribution and one number from the red distribution.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,340
Another way to think about it is we're basically constructing a multiplication table.

63
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,860
To be a little more visual about all of this, we could plot each one of these probabilities

64
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,680
as the height of a bar above the square in this sort of three-dimensional plot.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,600
In some sense, this three-dimensional plot carries all the data that we would need to know about rolling a pair of dice.

66
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,160
And so the question is how do we extract the thing that we want to know, the probabilities for various different sums?

67
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,200
Well, if you highlight all of the outcomes with a certain sum, say a sum of six,

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,260
notice how all of those end up on a certain diagonal.

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,760
Same deal if I highlight all the pairs where the sum is seven, they sit along a different diagonal.

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,800
So to compute the probability of each possible sum, what you do is you add together all of the entries that sit on one of these diagonals.

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,020
Pulling up the 3D plot, we can better foreshadow where we'll go with this later by saying that the distribution of possible sums

72
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,400
looks like combining all of the heights of this plot along one of these diagonal slices.

73
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,980
It's as if we've taken this full distribution for all possible outcomes and we've kind of collapsed it along one of the directions.

74
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,140
And admittedly, I'm just having a bit of fun with the animations at this point.

75
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,900
It's not like if you were working this out with pencil and paper you would be drawing some three-dimensional plot.

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,600
But it's fun when you collapse it on this direction, you actually do get the same distribution,

77
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,380
which I knew you should, but it's still fun to see.

78
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,840
Also, even though all of this might just seem a little bit playful or even unnecessarily complicated,

79
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,540
I can promise you this intuition about diagonal slices will come back to us later for a genuinely satisfying proof.

80
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,140
But staying focused on the simple dice case a little bit longer,

81
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,280
here's the second way that we could think about it.

82
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,340
Take that bottom distribution and flip it around horizontally so that the die values increase as you go from right to left.

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Why do this, you might ask? Well, notice now which of the pairs of dice values line up with each other.

84
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,720
As it's positioned right now, we have 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, and so on.

85
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,100
It is all of the pairs of values that add up to 7.

86
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,180
So if you want to think about the probability of rolling a 7, a way to hold that computation in your mind

87
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,200
is to take all of the pairs of probabilities that line up with each other, multiply together those pairs, and then add up all of the results.

88
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,640
Some of you might like to think of this as a kind of dot product.

89
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,540
But the operation as a whole is not just one dot product, but many. If we were to slide that bottom distribution a little more to the left,

90
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:50,300
so in this case it looks like the die values which line up are 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 2, 4 and 1,

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,760
in other words all the ones that add up to a 5,

92
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,220
well, now if we take the dot product, we multiply the pairs of probabilities that line up and add them together,

93
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,540
that would give us the total probability of rolling a 5.

94
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,040
In general, from this point of view, computing the full distribution for the sum

95
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,280
looks like sliding that bottom distribution into various different positions and computing this dot product along the way.

96
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,820
It is precisely the same operation as the diagonal slices we were looking at earlier.

97
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,800
They're just two different ways to visualize the same underlying operation.

98
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,580
And however you choose to visualize it, this operation that takes in two different distributions

99
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:40,880
and spits out a new one describing the sum of the relevant random variables is called a convolution, and we often denote it with this asterisk.

100
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,860
Really the way you want to think about it, especially as we set up for the continuous case,

101
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,240
is to think of it as combining two different functions and spitting out a new function.

102
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,480
For example, in this case, maybe I give the function for the first distribution the name p sub x.

103
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,980
This would be a function that takes in a possible value for the die, like a 3, and it spits out the corresponding probability.

104
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,060
Similarly, let's let p sub y be the function for our second distribution,

105
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,060
and p sub x plus y be the function describing the distribution for the sum.

106
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,080
In the lingo, what you would say is that p sub x plus y is equal to a convolution between p sub x and p sub y.

107
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,140
And what I want you to think about now is what the formula for this operation should look like.

108
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,660
You've seen two different ways to visualize it, but how do we actually write it down in symbols? To get your bearings,

109
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,020
maybe it's helpful to write down a specific example,

110
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,820
like the case of plugging in a 4, where you add up over all the different pairwise products

111
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,660
corresponding to pairs of inputs that add up to a 4.

112
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:49,220
And more generally, here's how it might look. This new function takes as an input a possible sum for your random variables,

113
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,820
which I'll call s, and what it outputs looks like a sum over a bunch of pairs of values for x and y.

114
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,100
Except the usual way it's written is not to write with x and y,

115
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,920
but instead we just focus on one of those variables, in this case x,

116
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,360
letting it range over all of its possible values, which here just means going from 1 all the way up to 6.

117
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:15,720
And instead of writing y, you write s minus x, essentially whatever the number has to be to make sure the sum is s.

118
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,680
Now the astute among you might notice a slightly weird quirk with the formula as it's written.

119
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,320
For example, if you plug in a given value like s equals 4,

120
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,040
and you unpack this sum, letting x range over all the possible values going from 1 up to 6,

121
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,960
then sometimes that corresponding y value drops below the domain of what we've explicitly defined.

122
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,540
For example, you plug in 0 and negative 1 and negative 2.

123
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,160
It's not actually that big a deal. Essentially, you would just say all of these values are 0, so all these later terms don't get counted.

124
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,280
And that should kind of make sense. What is the probability that the red die rolls to become a negative 1?

125
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,400
Well, it's 0. That is an impossible outcome.

126
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,740
As a next step, let's turn our attention towards continuous distributions,

127
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,040
where your random variable can take on values anywhere in an infinite continuum, like all possible real numbers.

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,360
Maybe you're doing weather modeling and trying to predict the temperature tomorrow at noon,

129
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,620
or you're doing some financial projections, or maybe you're modeling the typical wait times before a bus arrives.

130
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,360
There are all sorts of things where you need to handle continuity.

131
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,960
In all the graphs that we draw, the x value still represents a possible number that the random variable can take on,

132
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,700
but the interpretation of the y-axis is a little bit different, because no longer does this represent probability.

133
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,840
Instead, the thing that we're graphing is what's called probability density.

134
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,020
This is something we've talked about before, so you know the deal.

135
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,160
Essentially, the probability that a sample of your variable falls within a given range looks like the area under the curve in that range.

136
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,600
The function describing this curve is commonly called a probability density function,

137
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,660
a common enough phrase that it's frequently just given the abbreviation PDF,

138
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,820
and so the proper way to write all of this down would be to say that the probability that your sample falls within a given range

139
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,020
looks like the integral of your PDF, the probability density function, in that range.

140
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,600
As a general rule of thumb, anytime that you see a sum in the discrete case, you would use an integral in the continuous case.

141
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,300
So let's think about what that means for our main example.

142
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,140
Let's say we have two different random variables,

143
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:34,100
but this time each one will follow a continuous distribution, and we want to understand their sum and the new distribution that describes that sum.

144
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,920
You can probably already guess what the formula will be just by analogy.

145
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,740
Remember, in the formula that we just wrote down, where p sub x is the function for the first variable,

146
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,900
and p sub y is the function for the second variable, the convolution between them, the thing describing a sum of those variables,

147
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,840
itself looks like a sum where we combine a bunch of pairwise products.

148
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,980
The expression in the continuous case really does look 100% analogous. It's just that we swap out that sum for an integral.

149
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,620
Sometimes when students see this definition of a convolution out of context, it can seem a little intimidating.

150
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Hopefully the analogy is enough to make it clear, but the continuous nature really does give it a different flavor,

151
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,340
and it's worth taking a couple minutes to think through what it means on its own terms.

152
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:25,200
And so I put together a little interactive demo that helps unpack each part of the expression and what it's really saying.

153
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,560
For example, the first term in this integral is f of x, which represents the density function for the first of the two random variables.

154
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,820
And in this case, I'm choosing this sort of wedge-shaped function for that distribution, but it could be anything.

155
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:46,820
Similarly, g represents the density function for the second random variable, for which I'm choosing this sort of double lump-shaped distribution.

156
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,780
And in the same way that earlier we went over all possible pairs of dice values with a given sum,

157
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:00,000
the way you want to think about this integral is that what it wants to do is iterate over all possible pairs of values x and y

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
that are constrained to a given sum, s.

159
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,220
We don't really have great notation for doing that symmetrically,

160
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,800
so instead the way we commonly write it down gives this artificial emphasis to one of the variables, in this case x,

161
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,380
where we let that value x range over all possible real numbers, negative infinity up to infinity,

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,020
and the thing we plug into the function g is s minus x,

163
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,860
essentially whatever it has to be to make sure that this sum is constrained to be s.

164
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,600
So for the demo, instead of graphing g directly, I want to graph g of s minus x.

165
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,140
You might ask yourself, what does that look like?

166
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,900
Well, if you plug in negative x as the input, that has the effect of flipping around the graph horizontally.

167
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,720
And then if we throw in this parameter s,

168
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,980
treat it as some kind of constant, that has the effect of shifting the graph either left or right,

169
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:58,320
depending on if s is positive or negative. In the demo, s is a parameter that I'll just grab and shift around a little bit.

170
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,240
The real fun comes from graphing the entire contents of the integral, the product between these two graphs.

171
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,600
This is analogous to the list of pairwise products that we saw earlier,

172
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,740
but in this case instead of adding up all of those pairwise products, we want to integrate them together,

173
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,480
which you would interpret as the area underneath this product graph.

174
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,260
As I shift around this value of s, the shape of that product graph changes and so does the corresponding area.

175
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,300
Keep in mind for all three graphs on the left, the input is x and the number s is just a parameter.

176
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,360
But for the final graph on the right, for the resulting convolution itself, this number s is the input to that function,

177
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,380
and the corresponding output is whatever the area of the lower left graph is, whatever the integral between this

178
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,820
combination of f and g turns out to be.

179
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:00,320
Here, it might be helpful if we do a simple example, say where each of our two random variables follows a uniform distribution

180
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,760
between the values negative one half and positive one half.

181
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,480
So what that looks like is that our density functions each have this kind of top hat shape,

182
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:16,460
where the graph equals one for all inputs between negative one half and positive one half, and it equals zero everywhere else.

183
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,440
The question, as always, is what should the distribution for the sum look like?

184
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Well, let me show you how it looks inside our demo.

185
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,180
In this case, the product between the two graphs has a really easy interpretation.

186
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,060
It is one wherever the graphs overlap with each other, but zero everywhere else.

187
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,140
So if I slide this parameter s far enough to the left that our top graphs don't overlap at all,

188
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,540
then the product graph is zero everywhere, and that's a way of saying this is an impossible sum to achieve.

189
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,360
That should make sense. Each of the two variables can only get as low as negative one half,

190
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,340
so the sum could never get below negative one.

191
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:01,960
As I start to slide s to the right and the graphs overlap with each other, the area increases linearly

192
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,300
until the graphs overlap entirely and it reaches a maximum.

193
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:13,880
And then after that point it starts to decrease linearly again, which means that the distribution for the sum takes on this kind of wedge shape.

194
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:21,300
And I imagine this actually feels somewhat familiar for anyone who's thought about a pair of dice, that is unweighted dice.

195
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,640
There, if you add up two different uniformly distributed variables,

196
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,720
then the distribution for the sum has a certain wedge shape.

197
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,540
Probabilities increase until they max out at a seven and then they decrease back down again.

198
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,860
Where this gets a lot more fun is if instead of asking for a sum of two uniformly distributed variables,

199
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,800
I ask you what it looks like if we add up three different uniformly distributed variables.

200
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,580
At first you might say, I don't know, we need some new way to visualize combining three things instead of two.

201
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,760
But really what you can do here is think about the sum of the first two as their own variable,

202
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,600
which we just figured out follows this wedge shape distribution, and then take a convolution between that and the top hat function.

203
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,360
Pulling up the demo, here's what that would look like.

204
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:16,160
Once again, what makes the top hat function really nice is that multiplying by it sort of has the effect of filtering out values from the top graph.

205
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,760
The product on the bottom looks just like a copy of the top graph, but limited to a certain window.

206
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,160
Again, as I slide this around left and right and the area gets bigger and smaller, the result maxes out in the middle,

207
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,020
but tapers out to either side, except this time it does so more smoothly.

208
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,120
It's kind of like we're taking a moving average of that top left graph.

209
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,840
Actually, it's more than just kind of, this literally is a moving average of the top left graph.

210
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
One thing you might think to do is take this even further.

211
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,960
The way we started was combining two top hat functions and we got this wedge.

212
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,580
Then we replaced the first function with that wedge, and then when we took the convolution, we got this smoother shape

213
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,680
describing a sum of three distinct uniform variables.

214
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,500
But we could just repeat.

215
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,440
Swap that out for the top function and then convolve that with the flat rectangular function.

216
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,380
And whatever result we see should describe a sum of four uniformly distributed random variables.

217
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,320
Any of you who watched the video about the central limit theorem should know what to expect.

218
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,400
As we repeat this process over and over, the shape looks more and more like a bell curve.

219
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:29,200
Or to be more precise, at each iteration we should rescale the x-axis to make sure that the standard deviation is one,

220
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,740
because the dominant effect of this repeated convolution, the kind of repeated moving average process,

221
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,260
is to flatten out the function over time.

222
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,400
So in the limit it just flattens out towards zero. But rescaling is a way of saying yeah, yeah, yeah,

223
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,040
I know that it gets flatter, but what's the actual shape underlying it all?

224
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,420
The statement of the central limit theorem, one of the coolest facts from probability,

225
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,940
is that you could have started with essentially any distribution and this still would have been true.

226
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,220
That as you take repeated convolutions like this,

227
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,080
representing bigger and bigger sums of a given random variable,

228
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,140
then the distribution describing that sum, which might start off looking very different from a normal distribution,

229
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,420
over time smooths out more and more until it gets arbitrarily close to a normal distribution.

230
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,320
It's as if a bell curve is, in some loose manner of speaking, the smoothest possible distribution,

231
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,880
an attractive fixed point in the space of all possible functions, as we apply this process of repeated smoothing through the convolution.

232
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,920
Naturally you might wonder why normal distributions? Why this function and not some other one?

233
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,920
That's a very good answer, and I think the most fun way to show the answer is in the light of the last

234
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,160
visualization that we'll show for convolutions.

235
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,520
Remember how in the discrete case the first of our two visualizations involved forming this kind of multiplication table,

236
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,420
showing the probabilities for all possible outcomes and adding up along the diagonals?

237
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,620
You've probably guessed it by now, but our last step is to generalize this to the continuous case.

238
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,860
And it is beautiful, but you have to be a little bit careful.

239
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,740
Pulling up the same two functions we had before, f of x and g of y,

240
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,460
what in this case would be analogous to the grid of possible pairs that we were looking at earlier?

241
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,660
Well in this case each of the variables can take on any real number,

242
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,500
so we want to think about all possible pairs of real numbers and the xy plane comes to mind.

243
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,040
Every point corresponds to a possible outcome when we sample from both distributions.

244
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:44,240
Now the probability of any one of these outcomes xy, or rather the probability density around that point,

245
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,580
will look like f of x times g of y, again assuming that the two are independent.

246
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,180
So a natural thing to do is to graph this function f of x times g of y as a two variable function,

247
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,920
which would give something that looks like a surface above the xy plane.

248
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,980
Notice in this example how if we look at it from one angle where we see the x values changing,

249
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,520
it has the shape of our first graph, but if we look at it from another angle emphasizing the change in the y direction,

250
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,800
it takes on the shape of our second graph. This three-dimensional graph encodes all of the information we need.

251
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,120
It shows all the probability densities for every possible outcome.

252
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:28,000
And if you want to limit your view just to those outcomes where x plus y is constrained to be a given sum,

253
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,400
what that looks like is limiting our view to a diagonal slice, specifically a slice over the line x plus y equals some constant.

254
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,900
All of the possible probability densities for the outcome subject to this constraint look sort of like a slice under this graph,

255
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,680
and as we change around what specific sum we're constraining to,

256
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,480
it shifts around which specific diagonal slice we're looking at.

257
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,900
Now what you might predict is that the way to combine all of the probability densities along one of these slices, the way to integrate them together,

258
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,140
can be interpreted as the area under this curve, which is a slice of the surface.

259
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,960
And that is almost correct. There's a subtle detail regarding a factor of the square root of two that we need to talk about,

260
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,680
but up to a constant factor, the areas of these slices give us the values of the convolution.

261
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:28,240
In fact, all of these slices that we're looking at are precisely the same as the product graph that we were looking at earlier.

262
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,220
Here, to emphasize this point, let me pull up both visualizations side by side, and I'm going to slowly decrease the value of s,

263
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,140
which on the left means we're looking at different slices,

264
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,300
and on the right means we're shifting around the modified graph of g.

265
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,880
Notice how at all points the shape of the graph on the bottom right, the product between the functions,

266
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,760
looks exactly the same as the shape of the diagonal slice.

267
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,600
And this should make sense. They are two distinct ways to visualize the same thing.

268
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:10,080
It sounds like a lot when we put it into words, but what we're looking at are all the possible products between outputs of the functions,

269
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,940
corresponding to pairs of inputs that have a given sum.

270
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,450
Again, it's kind of a mouthful, but I think you see what I'm saying, and we now have two different ways to see it.

271
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,100
The nice thing about the diagonal slice visualization is that it makes it much more clear that it's a symmetric operation.

272
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,020
It's much more obvious that f convolved with g is the same thing as g convolved with f.

273
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,580
Technically, the diagonal slices are not exactly the same shape.

274
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,160
They've actually been stretched out by a factor of the square root of 2.

275
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,420
The basic reason is that if you imagine taking some small step along one of these lines where x plus y equals a constant,

276
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:05,200
then the change in your x value, the delta x here, is not the same thing as the length of that step.

277
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,880
That step is actually longer by a factor of the square root of 2.

278
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,220
I will leave a note up on the screen for the calculus enthusiasts among you who want to pause and ponder,

279
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,100
but the upshot is very simply that the outputs of our convolution are technically not quite the areas of these diagonal slices.

280
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,340
We have to divide those areas by a square root of 2.

281
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,540
Stepping back from all of this for a moment, I just think this is so beautiful.

282
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,400
We started with such a simple question, or at least such a seemingly simple question.

283
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,840
How do you add up two random variables? And what we end up with is this very intricate operation for combining two different functions.

284
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,540
We have at least two very pretty ways to understand it,

285
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,300
but still, some of you might be raising your hands and saying, pretty pictures are all well and good,

286
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,480
but do they actually help you calculate something? For example,

287
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,280
I still have not answered the opening quiz question about adding two normally distributed random variables.

288
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,760
Well, the ordinary way that you would approach this kind of question, if it showed up on a homework or something like that,

289
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,960
is that you would plug in the formula for a normal distribution into the definition of a convolution, the integral that we've been describing here.

290
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,420
And in that case, the visualizations would really just be there to clarify what the expression is saying, but they sit in the back seat.

291
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,280
In this case, the integral is not prohibitively difficult. There are analytical methods.

292
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,560
But for this example, I want to show you a more fun method where the visualizations,

293
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,040
specifically the diagonal slices, will play a much more front and center role in the proof itself.

294
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,160
I think many of you may actually enjoy taking a moment to predict how this will look for yourself.

295
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,220
Think about what this 3D graph would look like in the case of two normal distributions,

296
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,580
and what properties that it has that you might be able to take advantage of.

297
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,780
And it is for sure easiest if you start with the case where both distributions have the same standard deviation.

298
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,980
Whenever you want the details, and to see how the answer fits into the central limit theorem, come join me in the next video.

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,760
