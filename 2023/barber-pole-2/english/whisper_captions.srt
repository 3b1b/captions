00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
In the last video, you and I looked at this demo here, where we shine linearly polarized light through a tube full of sugar water,

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,580
and we saw how it rather mysteriously results in these colored diagonal stripes.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,060
There, I walked through the general outline for an explanation, keeping track of what questions still need to be answered.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,480
Namely, why does sugar water twist the polarization direction of light?

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,900
Why does that twisting rate depend on the color of the light?

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,620
And why, even if you understand that this twist is happening, would you see any evidence of it when viewing the tube from the side, with no additional polarizing filters?

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,860
Here, I'd like to begin with the very fundamental idea of what light is, and show how the answer to these questions can emerge from an extremely minimal set of assumptions.

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:57,200
In some sense, the fundamental question of electricity and magnetism is how the position and motion of one charged particle influences that of another.

9
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,480
For example, one of the first things you learn, say in a high school physics class, is that charges with the same sign tend to repel each other.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,120
And the strength of this force depends a lot on the distance between them.

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:16,020
If your charges are close, that repulsive force is very strong, but it decays very rapidly as these particles go away from each other.

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,000
Specifically, here's how you might see this written down as an equation, known as Coulomb's law.

13
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,360
The force is proportional to the charge of both of the particles, where it's common to use the letter q.

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,840
There are some constants in there, which for our purposes we can just think of as one big proportionality constant.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,140
And the important fact is that you've got this 1 divided by r squared term, where r is the distance between them.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,760
So for example, if the distance between them increases by a factor of 3, the force that they're applying to each other goes down by a factor of 9.

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:02:01,360
Another way you might see a law like this written down is to focus on just one charged particle, and then say for every point in space, if there was a second charge there, what force would this first charge be applying to that second one?

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:12,780
And instead of describing a force per se, you might see this written describing what's known as the electric field, which is just a way of saying what force would be applied to a unit charge.

19
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,260
And in this context, the word field means there's a value associated with every single point in space.

20
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:30,800
So the way I have it written here, it depends on a little vector r, which would be the vector from our charge to a given point in space, and the direction of this field at all points is in the same direction as r.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,400
I bring up Coulomb's law to emphasize that it's not the full story. There are other ways that charges influence each other.

22
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,160
For example, here's a phenomenon that this law alone could not explain.

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:51,620
If you wiggle one charge up and down, then after a little bit of a delay, a second charge some distance to its right will be induced to wiggle up and down as well.

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,020
We can write down a second law, which you might think of as a correction term to be added to Coulomb's law, that describes what's going on here.

25
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,580
Suppose at some point in time t0, that first charge is accelerating.

26
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:13,340
Then I'll let time play forward, but leave on the screen a kind of ghost of that particle indicating where it was and how it was accelerating at this time t0.

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,440
After a certain delay, this causes a force on the second charge, and the equation describing this force looks something like this.

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:31,060
So again, it's proportional to the charge of both of the particles, and once more a common way to write it involves this pile of constants that you don't really need to worry about.

29
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:41,980
The important factor I want you to notice is how the force also depends on the distance between the particles, but instead of decaying in proportion to r squared, it only decays in proportion to r.

30
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,500
So over long distances, this is the force that dominates, and Coulomb's law is negligible.

31
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:59,700
And then finally, it depends on the acceleration of that first particle, but it's not the acceleration of that particle at the current time, it's whatever that acceleration was at some time in the past.

32
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,480
How far in the past depends on the distance between the particles and the speed of light, denoted with c.

33
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,260
The way to think about it is that any form of influence can't propagate any faster than this speed, c.

34
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,480
In fact, a more accurate description of Coulomb's law would also involve a delay term like this.

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:25,760
Again, the intuitive way to read this equation is that wiggling a charge in one location after some delay causes a wiggle to a second charge in another location.

36
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,540
And actually, the way I have it written right now is a little bit wrong.

37
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Instead of the acceleration vector here, I should really be writing something like a perp,

38
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,760
indicating the component of that acceleration vector which is perpendicular to the line drawn between the two charges.

39
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,060
In other words, when you wiggle that first charge, the direction that the second charge wiggles is always perpendicular to the line between them,

40
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,880
and the amount that it wiggles gets weaker and weaker when that line between them is more lined up with the initial acceleration.

41
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,280
As before, this is something you might see written down in a way that describes a component of the electric field caused by just one charge.

42
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,120
Again, that means what force would be applied to a second charge at all possible different points in space.

43
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,160
This component of the field is only ever non-zero when our first charge is moving somehow, when it has an acceleration vector on it.

44
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,720
And because of this delay term, the effects on this field tend to radiate away from the charge.

45
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,340
This is why I'm writing it down with the subscript rad.

46
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,240
This is the component of the electric field that will radiate away from a given charge.

47
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,100
For instance, when the charge is oscillating up and down, you get these propagating waves.

48
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,540
And for many of the vector fields I'll be showing, the intensity of the field is illustrated with the opacity of each little vector.

49
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,880
This radiating influence is light, or more generally, electromagnetic radiation,

50
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,340
including things like radio waves and x-rays and all that good stuff.

51
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,960
As a side note, you sometimes see this propagation described a very different way that puts the fields front and center,

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,360
using what are known as Maxwell's equations.

53
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,940
For our purposes, I want to focus just on this one law and show just how far it can take us when it comes to intuitions for light.

54
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,140
For the animations I'm about to show, all I've really done is encoded in this one law,

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,860
which tells us what should this component of the electric field be at every point in space,

56
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,640
as determined by the history of accelerations of a particular charge.

57
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,300
For example, if I set that charge oscillating up and down in the z direction,

58
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,540
and illustrate this component of the electric field everywhere on the xy plane,

59
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,580
you see these circular propagations of equal strength in all directions.

60
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,980
It's a little easier to think about if we focus on just one axis, like the x-axis.

61
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,540
And at first when I made this animation, I assumed that there was some kind of bug,

62
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,360
because near the charge it just looks crooked and wrong.

63
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,660
But when you think about it, this is actually what you should expect,

64
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,500
because remember, each one of these vectors is supposed to be perpendicular

65
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,140
to the line drawn between that point and where the charge was at some point in the past.

66
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,540
At points that are far enough away from the charge,

67
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,720
which is where this component of the field is what dominates anyway,

68
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,780
the wiggling in the field is essentially parallel to the wiggling in the charge,

69
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
which is why when we think about light waves,

70
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,540
we're safe to think about the wiggling direction as being perpendicular to the propagation direction.

71
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,520
Like I said, this propagation for just one charge is equally strong

72
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,280
in all of the directions perpendicular to its wiggling,

73
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,380
and really I should emphasize that the propagation does happen

74
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,720
in all directions of three-dimensional space.

75
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,960
It's maybe a little busy to try to illustrate the full three-dimensional vector field on screen like this,

76
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,800
so it's clarifying if we just focus on, say, the xz plane.

77
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,940
Notice how the waves here are strongest in the x direction,

78
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,060
but it still does propagate in all other directions,

79
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,440
it's just that that propagation gets weaker in directions that are more aligned with the original wiggling.

80
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,740
At the extreme, the only place where there's no propagation is in the z axis.

81
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,880
Because our law has this 1 divided by r in it,

82
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,700
the strength of the wave caused by just one particle does decay as you go farther away,

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
in proportion to 1 over r.

84
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,220
But notice what happens if I take a whole row of charges, say oriented along the y axis,

85
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,580
and I have them all start wiggling up and down in the z direction,

86
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,320
and I illustrate the combined effects that all of them have on this component of the electric field.

87
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,720
The effects of all these charges interfere deconstructively along the y direction,

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,260
but they interfere constructively along the x direction.

89
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,600
This is what it looks like for a beam of light to be concentrated along just one dimension.

90
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,260
So if you were to focus on the field just along the x axis,

91
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,880
instead of decaying in proportion to 1 over r, this combined effect decays much more gently.

92
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,400
In the extreme, you can get something arbitrarily close to those

93
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,320
pure sine wave propagations we were illustrating earlier,

94
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,920
if at some distance away you have a large number of charges oscillating in sync with each other like this.

95
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,240
One thing that's worth emphasizing when you see light illustrated with a sine wave like this,

96
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,940
is that even though that wave is being drawn in two or three dimensions,

97
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,720
it's only describing the electric field along a one-dimensional line,

98
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
namely the base of all those vectors.

99
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,880
It's just that to draw the vectors you have to venture off of that line.

100
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,100
Great, so one of the last important things to highlight before we get back to the sugar water

101
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,600
is polarization.

102
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,520
In everything I've been showing, the driving charge is just oscillating along a single direction,

103
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,480
like the z axis, and this causes linearly polarized light.

104
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,260
But it doesn't have to happen like that.

105
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,160
For example, if I set the charge rotating in a little circle along the yz plane,

106
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,180
meaning its acceleration vector is also rotating in a little circle,

107
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,040
notice what the field looks like.

108
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
This is known, aptly enough, as circularly polarized light.

109
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,380
Honestly, it's easiest to think about for just one point of the electric field.

110
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,860
What it means for light to be circularly polarized is that at that point,

111
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,280
the electric field vector is just rotating in a circle.

112
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,800
People often find circular polarization a little confusing,

113
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,500
and I suspect part of the reason for that is that it's hard to illustrate with a static diagram,

114
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,680
but also it's a little confusing when you try to think about the full electric field.

115
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,160
For example, here's what the field looks like on the xy plane

116
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,820
when I set that little charge rotating in a circle.

117
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,640
It's certainly very beautiful, I could look at this all day,

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
but you can understand why it might feel a little confusing.

119
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,480
The very last thing I'll mention is that while everything here is a classical description of

120
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
light, the important points still hold up in quantum mechanics.

121
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,700
You still have propagating waves, there's still polarization that can be either linear or circular.

122
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,500
The main difference with quantum mechanics is that the energy in this wave

123
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,760
doesn't scale up and down continuously, like you might expect, it comes in discrete little steps.

124
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,220
I have another video that goes into more detail,

125
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,600
but for our purposes, thinking about it classically is fine.

126
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,040
Part of the reason I wanted to go through that is because, frankly,

127
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,700
it's just very fun to animate and I like an excuse for a fundamental lesson.

128
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,620
But now let's turn back to our demo and see how we can build up an intuition for some of our key

129
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,020
questions, starting from this very basic premise that shaking a charge in one location causes a

130
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,680
shake to another charge a little bit later. And let's start by actually skipping ahead

131
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
to question number three, why do we see the diagonal stripes?

132
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
To think about this, you need to imagine an observer to the side of the tube,

133
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,540
and then for a particular pure color, say red, if the observer looks in the tube and sees that

134
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,300
color, it's because light of that color has bounced off something at that point in the tube,

135
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,980
and then propagated towards the eye of the observer.

136
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,420
Sometimes when people talk about light bouncing off of things, the implied mental image is

137
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,480
a projectile ricocheting off of some object, heading off in some random direction.

138
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,120
But the better mental image to hold in your mind is that when the propagating light waves

139
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,300
caused by some wiggling charge reach some second charge causing it to wiggle,

140
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,440
that secondary wiggle results in its own propagation.

141
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,860
And for the animation on screen, that propagation goes back to the first charge,

142
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,340
which itself causes a propagation towards the second.

143
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,880
And this is what it looks like in a very simplified situation for light to bounce back

144
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,300
and forth between two charges.

145
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,240
If you have some concentrated beam of polarized light interacting with some charge, causing it

146
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,240
to wiggle up and down, then these resulting second-order propagations are most strong

147
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,040
in the directions perpendicular to the direction of polarization.

148
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,280
In some sense, you could think of light as bouncing off of that charge,

149
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,780
but the important point is that it doesn't bounce in all directions equally.

150
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,560
It's strongest perpendicular to the wiggle direction, but gets weaker in all of the other

151
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,120
directions.

152
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,560
So think about our setup, and for a particular frequency of light, how likely it is that

153
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,400
an observer looking at a particular point in the tube will see that light.

154
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,680
Again, the key phenomenon with sugar water, which we have yet to explain,

155
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,560
is that the polarization direction is slowly getting twisted as it goes down the tube.

156
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
So suppose the observer was looking at a point like this one,

157
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,280
where the polarization direction happens to be straight up and down.

158
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,300
Then the second-order propagations resulting from wiggling charges at that point

159
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,720
are most strong along the plane where the observer is,

160
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,140
so the amount of red that they see at that point would look stronger.

161
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,600
By contrast, if they were looking at a different point in the tube like this one,

162
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,580
where the wiggling direction is closer to being parallel to the line of sight,

163
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,460
then the direction where the scattering is strongest is not at all aligned with the observer,

164
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,260
and the amount of red they see is only going to be very weak.

165
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,300
And looking at our actual physical setup, if we first pass the light through a filter showing

166
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,680
only the red, we see exactly this effect in action.

167
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,260
As you scan your eyes along the tube, the intensity of red that you see

168
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,740
goes from being high to being low, where it's almost black, back to being high again.

169
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,100
As an analogy, imagine there was a ribbon going down the tube,

170
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,840
always aligned with the polarization direction for this color,

171
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,300
then putting yourself in the shoes of the observer,

172
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,000
when you look at points where the ribbon appears very thin,

173
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,840
you're going to see very little red light,

174
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,380
whereas if you scan your eyes over to points where the ribbon appears thicker,

175
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,260
you're going to see more red light.

176
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,080
One thing that's nice about this is that if we try it for various different colors,

177
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,640
you can actually see how the twisting rates are different for each one of the colors.

178
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,220
Notice with red light, the distance between where it appears brightest

179
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,620
and where it appears darkest is relatively long,

180
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,440
whereas if you look down the colors of the rainbow,

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,080
distance between the brightest point and the darkest point gets lower and lower.

182
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,960
So what you're seeing in effect is how red light twists slowly,

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,100
whereas light waves with higher frequencies get twisted more aggressively.

184
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,720
But still, you might wonder why the boundaries between light and dark points appear diagonal.

185
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,540
Why is it that in addition to having variation as you scan your eyes from left to right,

186
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,040
there's also variation as you scan your eyes from the top of the tube to the bottom?

187
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,580
This has less to do with what's going on in the tube, and more to do with a matter of perspective.

188
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,360
Take a moment to think about many different parallel beams of light

189
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,600
ranging from the top of the tube to the bottom.

190
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,940
At the beginning, all of these light waves are wiggling up and down,

191
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,820
and as you pass through the tube, and the effects of the sugar water somehow twists these directions,

192
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,460
because they're all passing through the same amount of sugar,

193
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,500
they're getting twisted by the same amounts.

194
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,000
So at all points, the polarization of these waves are parallel to each other.

195
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,320
If you're the observer and you look at the topmost point here,

196
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,700
its wiggling direction is essentially parallel to the line of sight,

197
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,120
so the light scattering from that point is basically not going to reach your eyes at all.

198
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,220
It should appear black.

199
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,300
But if you scan your eyes down the tube, the angle between the line of sight and the wiggling direction

200
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,020
changes, and so there will be at least some component of red light scattering towards the eye.

201
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,500
So as you scan your eyes from top to bottom,

202
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,060
the amount of a particular color you see might vary, say from dark to light.

203
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,640
The full demo that has white light is basically a combination of all these pure color patterns

204
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,880
that go from light to dark to light with diagonal boundaries between the intense points and the weak points,

205
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,340
hence why you see diagonal boundaries between the colors inside the tube.

206
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,800
And now at last let's turn to the heart of the matter and try to explain

207
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,480
why interactions with sugar would make light twist like this in the first place.

208
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,400
It's related to the idea that light seems to slow down as it passes through a given medium.

209
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,240
For example, if you look at the crests of a light wave as it goes into water,

210
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,000
the crests through the water are traveling about 1.33 times slower

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,540
than the crests of that wave would travel in a vacuum.

212
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,940
This number is what's called the index of refraction for water.

213
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,540
In a bit, what I'd like to show is how this index of refraction can be explained

214
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,960
by analyzing how the initial light wave shakes all the charges in the material

215
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,480
and how the resulting second order propagations superimpose with that original light wave.

216
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,820
For right now, I'll just say that the interactions with each layer of the material

217
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,180
ends up having the effect of slightly shifting back the phase of the wave,

218
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,000
and on the whole, this gives the overall appearance

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,480
that that wave moves slower as it passes through the material.

220
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,900
Skipping ahead to what's going on with sugar,

221
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,660
the relevant property of sucrose here is that it's what's called a chiral molecule,

222
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,840
meaning it's fundamentally different from its mirror image.

223
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,600
You could never reorient it in space to become identical to its mirror image.

224
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,920
It's like a left hand or a right hand.

225
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,740
Or another much simpler example of a chiral shape is a spiral.

226
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,900
If I take this right-handed spiral, then its mirror image is a left-handed spiral,

227
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,960
and no matter how you try to rotate and reorient that first one,

228
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,140
it'll never become identical to the second.

229
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,120
What's going on then is that the presence of a chiral molecule in the water like this

230
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,680
introduces an asymmetry when it comes to interactions with light,

231
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,280
specifically circularly polarized light.

232
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,280
It turns out that the amount this chiral molecule slows down,

233
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,940
say, left-handed circularly polarized light

234
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,760
is different from the amount that it slows down right-handed circularly polarized light.

235
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,240
Effectively, there's not one index of refraction, but two.

236
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
Now you might say that seems irrelevant to our setup,

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,540
since we are very deliberately shining in linearly polarized light,

238
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,700
there is no circularly polarized light.

239
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,120
But actually there's a sense in which linearly polarized light is equal parts

240
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,060
left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light.

241
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,480
Here, focus your attention on just one vector in this wave,

242
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,780
wiggling straight up and down, which is to say polarized in the z direction.

243
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,780
Notice how it's possible to express this vector as a sum of two rotating vectors,

244
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,820
one of them rotating at a constant rate counterclockwise,

245
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,420
and the other one rotating clockwise.

246
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,760
Adding them together tip to tail results in a vector oscillating on a line.

247
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,460
In this case, it's a vertical line,

248
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,760
but that direction can change based on the phase of the two vectors we're adding together.

249
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,260
Here, let me throw up a couple labels to keep track of how much

250
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,600
each one of those two vectors has rotated in total,

251
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,940
and then every now and then I'm going to slow down that first vector a little bit,

252
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,260
and I want you to notice what happens to their sum.

253
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,800
Well, every time I slow it down, effectively knocking back its phase a little bit,

254
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,340
it causes the linearly wiggling sum to wiggle in a slightly different direction.

255
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,900
So if the circularly polarized light wave represented by that left vector

256
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,660
gets slowed down a little bit every time it runs across a sugar molecule,

257
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,940
or at least slowed down more than its oppositely rotating counterpart would,

258
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,420
the effect on the sum is to slowly rotate the direction of linear polarization.

259
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,000
And hence, as you look at slices further and further down the tube,

260
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,420
the polarization direction does indeed get twisted the way we were describing earlier,

261
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,320
representing how the composite effects with many many many different sugar molecules

262
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,200
are slightly different for left-handed light than they are for right-handed light.

263
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,260
As a nice way to test whether you understood everything up to this point,

264
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,560
see if just by looking at the direction of the diagonal slices on our tube,

265
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,920
you can deduce which kind of light the sugar is slowing down more,

266
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,100
left-handed light or right-handed light.

267
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'll call this a partial answer to our question number one,

268
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,260
because it still leaves us wondering why there's an index of refraction in the first place,

269
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,640
and how exactly it might depend on the polarization of the light,

270
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,740
not just the material it's passing through.

271
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,360
Also, like I said at the start, a robust enough intuition here should also answer for us

272
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,940
why the strength of this effect would depend on the frequency of the light.

273
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,240
At this point I think we've covered quite enough for one video,

274
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,380
so I'll pull out a discussion covering the origins of the index of refraction to a separate video.

275
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:30,980
Thank you.
