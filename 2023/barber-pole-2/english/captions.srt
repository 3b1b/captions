00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,018
In the last video, you and I looked at this demo here, 

2
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:07,189
where we shine linearly polarized light through a tube full of sugar water, 

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,580
and we saw how it rather mysteriously results in these colored diagonal stripes.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,426
There, I walked through the general outline for an explanation, 

5
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:18,060
keeping track of what questions still need to be answered.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,480
Namely, why does sugar water twist the polarization direction of light?

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,900
Why does that twisting rate depend on the color of the light?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,080
And why, even if you understand that this twist is happening, 

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,670
would you see any evidence of it when viewing the tube from the side, 

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,620
with no additional polarizing filters?

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,956
Here, I'd like to begin with the very fundamental idea of what light is, 

12
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:43,265
and show how the answer to these questions can emerge from an extremely minimal set of 

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:43,860
assumptions.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,461
In some sense, the fundamental question of electricity and magnetism is how 

15
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:57,200
the position and motion of one charged particle influences that of another.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,621
For example, one of the first things you learn, say in a high school physics class, 

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,480
is that charges with the same sign tend to repel each other.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,120
And the strength of this force depends a lot on the distance between them.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,893
If your charges are close, that repulsive force is very strong, 

20
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:16,020
but it decays very rapidly as these particles go away from each other.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,993
Specifically, here's how you might see this written down as an equation, 

22
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:21,000
known as Coulomb's law.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,569
The force is proportional to the charge of both of the particles, 

24
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:26,360
where it's common to use the letter q.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,351
There are some constants in there, which for our purposes 

26
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:31,840
we can just think of as one big proportionality constant.

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,077
And the important fact is that you've got this 1 divided by r squared term, 

28
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:38,140
where r is the distance between them.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,740
So for example, if the distance between them increases by a factor of 3, 

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,760
the force that they're applying to each other goes down by a factor of 9.

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,260
Another way you might see a law like this written down is to focus on just one 

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,522
charged particle, and then say for every point in space, 

33
00:01:55,522 --> 00:02:00,272
if there was a second charge there, what force would this first charge be applying 

34
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:01,360
to that second one?

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,919
And instead of describing a force per se, you might see this 

36
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,821
written describing what's known as the electric field, 

37
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:12,780
which is just a way of saying what force would be applied to a unit charge.

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,690
And in this context, the word field means there's 

39
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,260
a value associated with every single point in space.

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,590
So the way I have it written here, it depends on a little vector r, 

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,496
which would be the vector from our charge to a given point in space, 

42
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:30,800
and the direction of this field at all points is in the same direction as r.

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,720
I bring up Coulomb's law to emphasize that it's not the full story.

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,400
There are other ways that charges influence each other.

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,160
For example, here's a phenomenon that this law alone could not explain.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,858
If you wiggle one charge up and down, then after a little bit of a delay, 

47
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:51,620
a second charge some distance to its right will be induced to wiggle up and down as well.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,696
We can write down a second law, which you might think of as a correction 

49
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:59,020
term to be added to Coulomb's law, that describes what's going on here.

50
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,580
Suppose at some point in time t0, that first charge is accelerating.

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,885
Then I'll let time play forward, but leave on the screen a kind of ghost of that 

52
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:13,340
particle indicating where it was and how it was accelerating at this time t0.

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,680
After a certain delay, this causes a force on the second charge, 

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,440
and the equation describing this force looks something like this.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,453
So again, it's proportional to the charge of both of the particles, 

56
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:28,480
and once more a common way to write it involves this pile of 

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,060
constants that you don't really need to worry about.

58
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,958
The important factor I want you to notice is how the force also 

59
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,439
depends on the distance between the particles, 

60
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,980
but instead of decaying in proportion to r squared, it only decays in proportion to r.

61
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,500
So over long distances, this is the force that dominates, and Coulomb's law is negligible.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,355
And then finally, it depends on the acceleration of that first particle, 

63
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:56,227
but it's not the acceleration of that particle at the current time, 

64
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:59,700
it's whatever that acceleration was at some time in the past.

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,748
How far in the past depends on the distance between the particles and the speed of light, 

66
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:05,480
denoted with c.

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,405
The way to think about it is that any form of 

68
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,260
influence can't propagate any faster than this speed, c.

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,227
In fact, a more accurate description of Coulomb's 

70
00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:16,480
law would also involve a delay term like this.

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,091
Again, the intuitive way to read this equation is that wiggling a charge in one 

72
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:25,760
location after some delay causes a wiggle to a second charge in another location.

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,540
And actually, the way I have it written right now is a little bit wrong.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,691
Instead of the acceleration vector here, I should really be writing 

75
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,639
something like a perp, indicating the component of that acceleration 

76
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,760
vector which is perpendicular to the line drawn between the two charges.

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,834
In other words, when you wiggle that first charge, 

78
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:48,237
the direction that the second charge wiggles is always perpendicular 

79
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:51,639
to the line between them, and the amount that it wiggles gets weaker 

80
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,880
and weaker when that line between them is more lined up with the initial acceleration.

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,730
As before, this is something you might see written down in a way that 

82
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,280
describes a component of the electric field caused by just one charge.

83
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,822
Again, that means what force would be applied to a 

84
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:11,120
second charge at all possible different points in space.

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,667
This component of the field is only ever non-zero when our first 

86
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:19,160
charge is moving somehow, when it has an acceleration vector on it.

87
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,122
And because of this delay term, the effects on 

88
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,720
this field tend to radiate away from the charge.

89
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,340
This is why I'm writing it down with the subscript rad.

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,240
This is the component of the electric field that will radiate away from a given charge.

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,100
For instance, when the charge is oscillating up and down, you get these propagating waves.

92
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,588
And for many of the vector fields I'll be showing, 

93
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,540
the intensity of the field is illustrated with the opacity of each little vector.

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,172
This radiating influence is light, or more generally, electromagnetic radiation, 

95
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:53,340
including things like radio waves and x-rays and all that good stuff.

96
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,567
As a side note, you sometimes see this propagation described a very different way 

97
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,360
that puts the fields front and center, using what are known as Maxwell's equations.

98
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,355
For our purposes, I want to focus just on this one law and show 

99
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:09,940
just how far it can take us when it comes to intuitions for light.

100
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,538
For the animations I'm about to show, all I've really done is encoded in this one law, 

101
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:21,173
which tells us what should this component of the electric field be at every point 

102
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:25,640
in space, as determined by the history of accelerations of a particular charge.

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,504
For example, if I set that charge oscillating up and down in the z direction, 

104
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:34,754
and illustrate this component of the electric field everywhere on the xy plane, 

105
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:38,580
you see these circular propagations of equal strength in all directions.

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,980
It's a little easier to think about if we focus on just one axis, like the x-axis.

107
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,800
And at first when I made this animation, I assumed that there was some kind of bug, 

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,360
because near the charge it just looks crooked and wrong.

109
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,505
But when you think about it, this is actually what you should expect, 

110
00:06:56,505 --> 00:07:00,664
because remember, each one of these vectors is supposed to be perpendicular to 

111
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:05,140
the line drawn between that point and where the charge was at some point in the past.

112
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,855
At points that are far enough away from the charge, 

113
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:12,035
which is where this component of the field is what dominates anyway, 

114
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:15,767
the wiggling in the field is essentially parallel to the wiggling in the charge, 

115
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:19,683
which is why when we think about light waves, we're safe to think about the wiggling 

116
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:22,540
direction as being perpendicular to the propagation direction.

117
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,635
Like I said, this propagation for just one charge is equally strong in all of 

118
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:30,625
the directions perpendicular to its wiggling, and really I should emphasize 

119
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,720
that the propagation does happen in all directions of three-dimensional space.

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,287
It's maybe a little busy to try to illustrate the full three-dimensional vector 

121
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:45,800
field on screen like this, so it's clarifying if we just focus on, say, the xz plane.

122
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,338
Notice how the waves here are strongest in the x direction, 

123
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,021
but it still does propagate in all other directions, 

124
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,667
it's just that that propagation gets weaker in directions that are more 

125
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,440
aligned with the original wiggling.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,740
At the extreme, the only place where there's no propagation is in the z axis.

127
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,005
Because our law has this 1 divided by r in it, 

128
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:12,034
the strength of the wave caused by just one particle does decay as you go farther away, 

129
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,520
in proportion to 1 over r.

130
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,161
But notice what happens if I take a whole row of charges, say oriented along the y axis, 

131
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:22,835
and I have them all start wiggling up and down in the z direction, 

132
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,497
and I illustrate the combined effects that all of them have on this component of the 

133
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:28,320
electric field.

134
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,859
The effects of all these charges interfere deconstructively along the y direction, 

135
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:38,260
but they interfere constructively along the x direction.

136
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,385
This is what it looks like for a beam of light 

137
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,600
to be concentrated along just one dimension.

138
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,154
So if you were to focus on the field just along the x axis, 

139
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:51,079
instead of decaying in proportion to 1 over r, 

140
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,880
this combined effect decays much more gently.

141
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,374
In the extreme, you can get something arbitrarily close to those pure sine 

142
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,726
wave propagations we were illustrating earlier, 

143
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:05,401
if at some distance away you have a large number of charges oscillating in 

144
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,920
sync with each other like this.

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,911
One thing that's worth emphasizing when you see light illustrated 

146
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,477
with a sine wave like this, is that even though that wave is being 

147
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:18,095
drawn in two or three dimensions, it's only describing the electric 

148
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:21,980
field along a one-dimensional line, namely the base of all those vectors.

149
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,880
It's just that to draw the vectors you have to venture off of that line.

150
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,939
Great, so one of the last important things to highlight 

151
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,600
before we get back to the sugar water is polarization.

152
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,329
In everything I've been showing, the driving charge is just oscillating along 

153
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,480
a single direction, like the z axis, and this causes linearly polarized light.

154
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,260
But it doesn't have to happen like that.

155
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,031
For example, if I set the charge rotating in a little circle along the yz plane, 

156
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,096
meaning its acceleration vector is also rotating in a little circle, 

157
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,040
notice what the field looks like.

158
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
This is known, aptly enough, as circularly polarized light.

159
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,380
Honestly, it's easiest to think about for just one point of the electric field.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,176
What it means for light to be circularly polarized is that at that point, 

161
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:10,280
the electric field vector is just rotating in a circle.

162
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,655
People often find circular polarization a little confusing, 

163
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:17,572
and I suspect part of the reason for that is that it's hard to illustrate with 

164
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:21,489
a static diagram, but also it's a little confusing when you try to think about 

165
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:22,680
the full electric field.

166
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,096
For example, here's what the field looks like on the xy 

167
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:28,820
plane when I set that little charge rotating in a circle.

168
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,783
It's certainly very beautiful, I could look at this all day, 

169
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:36,560
but you can understand why it might feel a little confusing.

170
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,860
The very last thing I'll mention is that while everything here is a classical 

171
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,600
description of light, the important points still hold up in quantum mechanics.

172
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,299
You still have propagating waves, there's still 

173
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,700
polarization that can be either linear or circular.

174
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,278
The main difference with quantum mechanics is that the energy in this wave doesn't 

175
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,760
scale up and down continuously, like you might expect, it comes in discrete little steps.

176
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,726
I have another video that goes into more detail, 

177
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:04,600
but for our purposes, thinking about it classically is fine.

178
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,322
Part of the reason I wanted to go through that is because, frankly, 

179
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:11,700
it's just very fun to animate and I like an excuse for a fundamental lesson.

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,105
But now let's turn back to our demo and see how we can build up an intuition 

181
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:19,705
for some of our key questions, starting from this very basic premise that 

182
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:23,840
shaking a charge in one location causes a shake to another charge a little bit later.

183
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,192
And let's start by actually skipping ahead to question number three, 

184
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,720
why do we see the diagonal stripes?

185
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,923
To think about this, you need to imagine an observer to the side of the tube, 

186
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,480
and then for a particular pure color, say red, 

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,472
if the observer looks in the tube and sees that color, 

188
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:48,151
it's because light of that color has bounced off something at that point in the tube, 

189
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,980
and then propagated towards the eye of the observer.

190
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,159
Sometimes when people talk about light bouncing off of things, 

191
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,354
the implied mental image is a projectile ricocheting off of some object, 

192
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,480
heading off in some random direction.

193
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,218
But the better mental image to hold in your mind is that when the propagating 

194
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:10,763
light waves caused by some wiggling charge reach some second charge causing it to wiggle, 

195
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,440
that secondary wiggle results in its own propagation.

196
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,943
And for the animation on screen, that propagation goes back to the first charge, 

197
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:20,340
which itself causes a propagation towards the second.

198
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,667
And this is what it looks like in a very simplified situation 

199
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,300
for light to bounce back and forth between two charges.

200
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,899
If you have some concentrated beam of polarized light interacting with some charge, 

201
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,469
causing it to wiggle up and down, then these resulting second-order propagations 

202
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:41,040
are most strong in the directions perpendicular to the direction of polarization.

203
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,575
In some sense, you could think of light as bouncing off of that charge, 

204
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,780
but the important point is that it doesn't bounce in all directions equally.

205
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,774
It's strongest perpendicular to the wiggle direction, 

206
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,120
but gets weaker in all of the other directions.

207
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,240
So think about our setup, and for a particular frequency of light, 

208
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,593
how likely it is that an observer looking at a particular point in the tube will 

209
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:03,400
see that light.

210
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,120
Again, the key phenomenon with sugar water, which we have yet to explain, 

211
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,560
is that the polarization direction is slowly getting twisted as it goes down the tube.

212
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,183
So suppose the observer was looking at a point like this one, 

213
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:19,280
where the polarization direction happens to be straight up and down.

214
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,829
Then the second-order propagations resulting from wiggling charges 

215
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:26,484
at that point are most strong along the plane where the observer is, 

216
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:30,140
so the amount of red that they see at that point would look stronger.

217
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,759
By contrast, if they were looking at a different point in the tube like this one, 

218
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,304
where the wiggling direction is closer to being parallel to the line of sight, 

219
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:41,894
then the direction where the scattering is strongest is not at all aligned with 

220
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:45,260
the observer, and the amount of red they see is only going to be very weak.

221
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,392
And looking at our actual physical setup, if we first pass the light 

222
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:54,680
through a filter showing only the red, we see exactly this effect in action.

223
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,787
As you scan your eyes along the tube, the intensity of red that you see goes 

224
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:04,740
from being high to being low, where it's almost black, back to being high again.

225
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,105
As an analogy, imagine there was a ribbon going down the tube, 

226
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:12,170
always aligned with the polarization direction for this color, 

227
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,701
then putting yourself in the shoes of the observer, 

228
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,620
when you look at points where the ribbon appears very thin, 

229
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,416
you're going to see very little red light, whereas if you scan your eyes over 

230
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:25,260
to points where the ribbon appears thicker, you're going to see more red light.

231
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,777
One thing that's nice about this is that if we try it for various different colors, 

232
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:33,640
you can actually see how the twisting rates are different for each one of the colors.

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,573
Notice with red light, the distance between where it appears brightest and where it 

234
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:43,029
appears darkest is relatively long, whereas if you look down the colors of the rainbow, 

235
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,080
distance between the brightest point and the darkest point gets lower and lower.

236
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,606
So what you're seeing in effect is how red light twists slowly, 

237
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:57,100
whereas light waves with higher frequencies get twisted more aggressively.

238
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,513
But still, you might wonder why the boundaries 

239
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,720
between light and dark points appear diagonal.

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,747
Why is it that in addition to having variation as you scan your eyes from left to right, 

241
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:15,040
there's also variation as you scan your eyes from the top of the tube to the bottom?

242
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,487
This has less to do with what's going on in the tube, 

243
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,580
and more to do with a matter of perspective.

244
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,116
Take a moment to think about many different parallel beams 

245
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:26,600
of light ranging from the top of the tube to the bottom.

246
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,128
At the beginning, all of these light waves are wiggling up and down, 

247
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:33,237
and as you pass through the tube, and the effects of the sugar water 

248
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:36,346
somehow twists these directions, because they're all passing through 

249
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:39,500
the same amount of sugar, they're getting twisted by the same amounts.

250
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,000
So at all points, the polarization of these waves are parallel to each other.

251
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,641
If you're the observer and you look at the topmost point here, 

252
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:50,907
its wiggling direction is essentially parallel to the line of sight, 

253
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:55,120
so the light scattering from that point is basically not going to reach your eyes at all.

254
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,220
It should appear black.

255
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,940
But if you scan your eyes down the tube, the angle between the line 

256
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,026
of sight and the wiggling direction changes, and so there will be 

257
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:06,020
at least some component of red light scattering towards the eye.

258
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,452
So as you scan your eyes from top to bottom, the amount of 

259
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:13,060
a particular color you see might vary, say from dark to light.

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,542
The full demo that has white light is basically a combination of all 

261
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,020
these pure color patterns that go from light to dark to light with 

262
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,550
diagonal boundaries between the intense points and the weak points, 

263
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,340
hence why you see diagonal boundaries between the colors inside the tube.

264
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,376
And now at last let's turn to the heart of the matter and try to explain why 

265
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:39,480
interactions with sugar would make light twist like this in the first place.

266
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,273
It's related to the idea that light seems to slow 

267
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,400
down as it passes through a given medium.

268
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,070
For example, if you look at the crests of a light wave as it goes into water, 

269
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,652
the crests through the water are traveling about 1.33 times slower 

270
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:55,540
than the crests of that wave would travel in a vacuum.

271
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,940
This number is what's called the index of refraction for water.

272
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,290
In a bit, what I'd like to show is how this index of refraction can be explained by 

273
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,940
analyzing how the initial light wave shakes all the charges in the material and how 

274
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,480
the resulting second order propagations superimpose with that original light wave.

275
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,777
For right now, I'll just say that the interactions with each layer 

276
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:21,327
of the material ends up having the effect of slightly shifting back 

277
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:24,668
the phase of the wave, and on the whole, this gives the overall 

278
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,480
appearance that that wave moves slower as it passes through the material.

279
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,865
Skipping ahead to what's going on with sugar, the relevant 

280
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:37,674
property of sucrose here is that it's what's called a chiral molecule, 

281
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:40,840
meaning it's fundamentally different from its mirror image.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,600
You could never reorient it in space to become identical to its mirror image.

283
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,920
It's like a left hand or a right hand.

284
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,740
Or another much simpler example of a chiral shape is a spiral.

285
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,485
If I take this right-handed spiral, then its mirror image is a left-handed spiral, 

286
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:58,888
and no matter how you try to rotate and reorient that first one, 

287
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:01,140
it'll never become identical to the second.

288
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,077
What's going on then is that the presence of a chiral molecule 

289
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:12,046
in the water like this introduces an asymmetry when it comes to interactions with light, 

290
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:14,280
specifically circularly polarized light.

291
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,479
It turns out that the amount this chiral molecule slows down, 

292
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:21,899
say, left-handed circularly polarized light is different from 

293
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:25,760
the amount that it slows down right-handed circularly polarized light.

294
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,240
Effectively, there's not one index of refraction, but two.

295
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,050
Now you might say that seems irrelevant to our setup, 

296
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,640
since we are very deliberately shining in linearly polarized light, 

297
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,700
there is no circularly polarized light.

298
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,659
But actually there's a sense in which linearly polarized light is 

299
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,060
equal parts left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light.

300
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,778
Here, focus your attention on just one vector in this wave, 

301
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:54,780
wiggling straight up and down, which is to say polarized in the z direction.

302
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,762
Notice how it's possible to express this vector as a sum of two rotating vectors, 

303
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:04,216
one of them rotating at a constant rate counterclockwise, 

304
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:06,420
and the other one rotating clockwise.

305
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,760
Adding them together tip to tail results in a vector oscillating on a line.

306
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,855
In this case, it's a vertical line, but that direction can change 

307
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,760
based on the phase of the two vectors we're adding together.

308
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,316
Here, let me throw up a couple labels to keep track of how much each one of those 

309
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:28,335
two vectors has rotated in total, and then every now and then I'm going to slow down 

310
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:32,260
that first vector a little bit, and I want you to notice what happens to their sum.

311
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,913
Well, every time I slow it down, effectively knocking back its phase a little bit, 

312
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,340
it causes the linearly wiggling sum to wiggle in a slightly different direction.

313
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,452
So if the circularly polarized light wave represented by that left vector 

314
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:54,624
gets slowed down a little bit every time it runs across a sugar molecule, 

315
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:58,965
or at least slowed down more than its oppositely rotating counterpart would, 

316
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:03,420
the effect on the sum is to slowly rotate the direction of linear polarization.

317
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,383
And hence, as you look at slices further and further down the tube, 

318
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:11,430
the polarization direction does indeed get twisted the way we were describing earlier, 

319
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,920
representing how the composite effects with many many many different sugar 

320
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,920
molecules are slightly different for left-handed light than they are for right-handed 

321
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,200
light.

322
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,800
As a nice way to test whether you understood everything up to this point, 

323
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,662
see if just by looking at the direction of the diagonal slices on our tube, 

324
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:31,067
you can deduce which kind of light the sugar is slowing down more, 

325
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,100
left-handed light or right-handed light.

326
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,867
I'll call this a partial answer to our question number one, 

327
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:43,042
because it still leaves us wondering why there's an index of refraction in the first 

328
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,627
place, and how exactly it might depend on the polarization of the light, 

329
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,740
not just the material it's passing through.

330
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,570
Also, like I said at the start, a robust enough intuition here should also answer 

331
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,940
for us why the strength of this effect would depend on the frequency of the light.

332
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,782
At this point I think we've covered quite enough for one video, 

333
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,582
so I'll pull out a discussion covering the origins of the index of refraction to 

334
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,380
a separate video.

335
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:30,980
Thank you.
