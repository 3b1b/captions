00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,100
Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's JPBM Communications Award lecture.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,860
I'm Michael Pearson with the Mathematical Association of America.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,260
We're part of JPBM.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm really delighted to be able to recognize Grant Sanderson today with one of this year's

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,920
communications awards.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,700
Grant is the creator and founder of 3Blue1Brown, which is an effort to provide visualization

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,360
of mathematics and it's a YouTube channel, easily found.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,320
I hope you'll take a look at it.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,080
I had done my homework, as I'm supposed to do, when I was warned to do this and written

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,720
out a nice introduction, which of course I can now not find on my electronic device,

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,500
which is supposed to give me that.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,600
But I'll say, as I went on the site and as a harmonic analyst, I've spent a good bit

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,260
of time thinking about convolutions, convolution kernels and so forth.

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,820
I was really immediately attracted to see what Grant would do with convolution.

15
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,020
He has a nice video presentation, what's the introduction to convolution.

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,460
Some of you may know that the German word for convolution is folding and I think the

17
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,620
video that Grant does with that really sort of makes that dynamic and shows you why folding

18
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,280
is such a great word for convolution.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,180
So I encourage you to look at that one and any others that catch your eye.

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,420
In any case, Grant graduated from Stanford University for math and computer science in

21
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,820
2015.

22
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:53,700
He spent some time working on videos and instructional materials for the Khan Academy and then by

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,300
now he's turned his full-time attention to 3Blue1Brown and there's some really great

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,620
stuff there and without further ado, I'll let him tell us about it.

25
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
Thank you.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,620
Thanks, Grant.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,940
Thank you very much for that very warm introduction.

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,380
I want to start just by saying a very heartfelt thanks to the members of the Joint Policy

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,500
Board for the award.

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I will admit it is a little bit intimidating to receive an award for communication and

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,780
then to be asked to immediately communicate to a room full of people I have high respect

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
for.

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,020
I'll do my best but I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the names on the list

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,640
for this particular award in past years were just personal heroes of mine who served to

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,340
inspire me a lot in getting started.

36
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,700
Names like Steve Strogatz or James Glick or Matt Parker all come to mind but those

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,020
are just a few, very, very many so I want to say thanks there.

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,860
Broadly speaking, I want to talk about math communication itself and some of my thoughts

39
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,820
around math communication but this breaks into a number of different categories and

40
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,860
it's kind of a hard thing to think about as a unified whole because one component of

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,380
that is education and even that it feels wrong to loop into a single group because education

42
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,140
before university and math and education undergrad and on have a very qualitatively different

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,380
flavour to them and how you might think about what approaches are best or what's the typical

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,660
engagement a student has and even that is very different from other forms of communication

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,060
that happen, you know, presenting one's research or popularisation which is probably

46
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,980
the bucket that I fit most closely into if I had to choose just one that's where I

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,780
actually sit.

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,640
But I do think it's very helpful whichever one of these slices you find yourself in to

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,780
think about them as intersecting each other and a lot of the value coming from that intersection.

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,940
You know, some directions here are obvious like if you're in education it doesn't

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,820
hurt to think about it as a popularisation effort.

52
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,380
If you want to popularise something you try to make it more engaging, you try to connect

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,700
to things that people are already interested in.

54
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,460
Doesn't hurt to do the same if it's in a classroom but I also think on the flipside

55
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,660
as someone who popularises things or at least tries to, it's often not the right approach

56
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,700
to do that head on and think how can I make something that's going to reach the most

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,180
people, you know, has the most clickbait title and the like but what I've noticed

58
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,380
is people just want to learn.

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,340
The thing that makes something more popular, the thing that gets more reach, is often if

60
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,620
I do something that's meant more as a classroom supplement, because people don't want to

61
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,220
feel like they're just being watered down or talked down to instead having a sense that

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,920
what they're staring at is the authentic material as if they were studying it and becoming

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,420
an expert in it, I think that's a very inspiring feeling.

64
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,380
So I titled this, you know, raising the ceiling and lowering the floor of math exposition,

65
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,580
you know, referencing the fact that I think some of the efforts that we can make in trying

66
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,260
to popularise it to reach more people can also make it more interesting to those who

67
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,700
are already experts in it but if I wanted to be a little bit more provocative in how

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,020
I went about this talk, I could just as easily give what I have in mind the name of math's

69
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,420
pedagogical curse because I really do think there's something strange going on with

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,100
math in particular in contrast to some other fields if we think about the perception that

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,380
it has in the broader public.

72
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,660
I think everybody in this room has probably had the experience, you're chatting with

73
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,620
someone, cocktail party type environment, you mention you do something related to math

74
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,540
and the person says, as if there's no social taboo in saying it at all, which I guess there's

75
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,060
not, oh I'm not really a math person, which is fair, you know, not everybody necessarily

76
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,140
loves the subject that we do but it's a funny phrase because, you know, you don't

77
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,860
say that with respect to other things but there's another turn of phrase that I've

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,980
heard multiple different times that in some senses even more worrying than that one,

79
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,420
which is the I thought I liked math until.

80
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,060
I have a very vivid memory actually of being a high school student touring different universities

81
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,280
and I was one of those students who always knew that I wanted to study math, I had already

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,700
fallen in love with it so if I'd meet some students at the university, they ask their

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,020
natural questions, oh what do you think you might want to major in, I was like I know

84
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,860
I want to major in math and I remember this one student saying, oh yeah, yeah, I thought

85
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,340
I liked math, I even wanted to be a math major and then I took a set theory class and

86
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,180
I discovered that I don't really like math, which is very sad and I've heard variants

87
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,460
of this through the years in various different contexts, oh I thought I liked math and then

88
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,260
I took a linear algebra class, right, I thought I liked math until and then there's some

89
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,220
point in which someone became disillusioned with it for whatever reason.

90
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,260
Now that one feels like it's especially worth addressing because it's very hard I

91
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,020
think to ignite the light of interest in the first place and even if maybe the more important

92
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,420
one to address is the broad scope of people who don't self-identify as math people,

93
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,980
we could just as easily ask what are we doing wrong such that we get some people that thought

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,340
they liked math until, you know, maybe the answer is math is just harder than other fields,

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,420
you know, it's just something you got to roll up your sleeves and you know work hard

96
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,340
in order to attain and not all people are willing to do that.

97
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,420
I don't think that would be fair though because that kind of pushes the bump under

98
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,060
the rug where you have to instead ask does it have to be that hard, you know, is there

99
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,060
anything that we're doing that makes it harder than it needs to be?

100
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,220
And I have a little theory for at least one component of what might be going on with math

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,580
in what makes it distinct from other fields and it has to do, bear with me here, with

102
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,000
the legend of King Midas.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,860
So for those of you who don't know, in Greek mythology, or it's one of those kind of

104
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,740
intertwined with fake Greek history that Aristotle and the like would tell to people, you have

105
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,580
this king supposedly who lived around the second millennium BC named Midas and you know

106
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,580
he does some good deeds that catch the attention of certain gods and the god Dionysus says

107
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm willing to give you a gift, name your gift and I will give it to you.

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,460
And Midas says oh, what gift should I want?

109
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,060
I think it would be great if anything that I touched could turn to gold and Dionysus

110
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,880
says it is done.

111
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,480
And Midas touches a twig and it turns into gold, he's delighted.

112
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,180
He goes back to his estate and he starts touching all of the roses in his garden and they turn

113
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,860
into a beautiful metallic sheening gold and he's just dreaming of all the wealth that

114
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,380
he's going to have and the wealth that his entire regime is going to have.

115
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,980
And then when he gets to the banquet for dinner that night he touches the chicken leg sitting

116
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,380
in front of him and it turns to gold and it's completely inedible.

117
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,980
Or in other tellings of the story, the moment that he realizes something might be a little

118
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,340
bit wrong with this gift is when his daughter comes up to him and he touches her and she

119
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,540
completely turns into gold and he doesn't have her anymore.

120
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,100
And of course it proceeds where it's a story of redemption and the like.

121
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:31,620
But the gift that is analogous to this that I think math has, and it really is a gift,

122
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,260
is a very special kind of exactness where we have the pleasure of knowing with 100%

123
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,540
certainty if a conclusion follows from the premises.

124
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,700
Maybe not 100% it's subject to our ability to fall for certain logical fallacies or to

125
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
miss holes in an argument.

126
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,580
But with as much precision as you could possibly hope for, math has this kind of exactness.

127
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,260
And a lot of other fields would just dream of anything like this.

128
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,720
Hard sciences get kind of close if we think of physics or computer science.

129
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,980
But even then they're subject to a little bit of controversy with different ways you

130
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,100
might interpret something or even the best experiments aren't 100% precise.

131
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,460
The softer sciences get even further away from this.

132
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,580
Most forms of writing and discourse out there are more unabashedly subjective.

133
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,260
You might think of art criticism.

134
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,380
It's not unworthy but it lacks this exactness.

135
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,140
And the gift that comes from this exactness is that it helps you move forward a field.

136
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,020
You don't fall into the same disputes that you might otherwise when there's room for

137
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,860
ambiguity and misinterpretations.

138
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,860
And I think what it might even mean for something to be mathematical is that it has this level

139
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
of exactness.

140
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,140
There's a friend of mine who's a biologist and any time we talk she always bemoans the

141
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,060
fact that biology needs to become more of a mathematical science.

142
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,140
Just how far could humanity progress if we could turn biology into a mathematical science.

143
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,520
And presumably what she means by that is that you get a situation where you can draw conclusions

144
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,020
from your premises with the same airtight rock solid rigor that a field like physics

145
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,140
might have.

146
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,900
The other really nice thing that this gets us I think is when you're writing something

147
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,500
like you're writing a textbook or a paper or a video or you're preparing a lecture,

148
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,160
it gives a test for completion that no one else gets to have.

149
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,260
We can have this clear notion of it's not done yet and then at some point there's a

150
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,580
sense in which it's done.

151
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,180
Where you can go through and you can make sure all of the definitions are completely

152
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,180
unambiguous.

153
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,200
We get to have unambiguous definitions.

154
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
Everyone else doesn't get to have those.

155
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,500
You can ask whether every object in the theorems that you reference have been previously defined.

156
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,980
It's like a compiler checking code.

157
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,700
You get to go through and the answer is either clearly delineated yes or clearly delineated

158
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
no.

159
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,340
And then most importantly for every claim that you make you can ask was it completely

160
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,580
justified.

161
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,700
And then that constitutes a notion of explanation in some sense.

162
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,260
It gives you a clear point where before you before you got to that point the paper wasn't

163
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,500
finished or the lecture wasn't finished but after that point you can put a little bow

164
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,580
around it and say it was finished.

165
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,580
And like I said I really do think it's a gift because it helps us move forward in a way

166
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,220
that other fields can't.

167
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,860
But there's a catch to this gift where in the same way that the things that King Minus

168
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,500
might touch and turn to gold but this had a problem where he wouldn't be able to eat

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,380
his food.

170
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,740
The mathematician can touch anything give it this notion of completely unambiguous rigor

171
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,860
but sometimes it runs the risk of leaving it how shall we put it slightly unpalatable

172
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,820
to the average casual reader or maybe a little bit harder to consume than it needs to be

173
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,860
for a typical student.

174
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,300
And I do want to emphasize I don't think that it's a necessary thing that follows.

175
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,020
I don't want to come across as implying that if something is rigorous that means that it's

176
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,820
not clear.

177
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,700
It's a little bit of an exaggeration to make the comparison with Midas quite like this.

178
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,180
But what I do think is possibly the case is that this allure of such a notion of exactness

179
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,020
where we can actually say that it is done in a certain sense means that rigor serves

180
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,260
kind of as a distraction right.

181
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,100
I have to tell you there will be no year that I grow tired of this meme.

182
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,980
I know it's a little bit old but the staying power with this is just unparalleled.

183
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,780
No but I think it's the case that a lot of really good authors managed to achieve both

184
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,460
rigor and clarity and in fact the point of rigor is often to add more clarity.

185
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,260
But the thing that I suspect might happen every now and then is that because the rigor

186
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,060
gives you this very clean nice thing to think about and because thinking about pedagogical

187
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,700
clarity is a lot messier, you know it's harder to define, you can't put a bow around it,

188
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,100
there's not one point when you've gone from not done to completely done.

189
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,400
That after scratching the itch of knowing that something's been written completely rigorously

190
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,780
it's easy to call a work done when maybe we shouldn't call it done yet.

191
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,200
And there's context where this is maybe okay, research papers come to mind.

192
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,600
But in things that are more explicitly pedagogical, textbooks come to mind.

193
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,160
I would propose that maybe it makes sense to invite into the culture a similar focus

194
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,200
that we already have on the rigor of it but instead onto something for the pedagogical clarity.

195
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,200
And I'll give an example here which is essentially just from the book that was sitting on my

196
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
desk while I was putting together these slides.

197
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,220
I actually love the textbook, it's really great and one of the only reasons I feel comfortable

198
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,960
highlighting it and poking a little bit of fun at one of the sections is because it otherwise

199
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,080
holds up very well and it's one I would unabashedly recommend.

200
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,640
But I was thinking okay, you know, how well does the author tend to think about points

201
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,760
of pedagogical clarity in addition to points of rigorous clarity?

202
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,140
And one particular section that I was looking at was about something called the Poisson

203
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,840
summation formula, many of you might be familiar with it.

204
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,200
It essentially says for a function which is sufficiently nice, if you add up the value

205
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,920
of that function across all of the integers it gets the same thing as if you add up the

206
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
Fourier transform of that function across all the integers.

207
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,100
It's kind of a wild formula, very useful in many different contexts.

208
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,720
And the proof that the book gives is actually really beautiful, I liked it a lot.

209
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,600
It starts off by describing a certain function a little bit out of the blue but if you look

210
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,400
at it you notice that it has poles at all of the integers and the residue at those poles

211
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,920
are exactly the values that you might want to sum on the left hand side of your formula.

212
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,620
And essentially what the book does is it kind of after handing down this construct

213
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,640
and after describing a certain contour that you might integrate along, and the context

214
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,120
here was, you know, it's in a setting of assuming people are familiar with the complex analysis

215
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,000
up to the point in the book and know about contour integrals and the like, it goes through

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,200
and shows how you can have a very elegant derivation of the formula basically by unpacking

217
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,880
what this integral is saying and step by step it eventually turns it into the sum on the

218
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
right hand side.

219
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,200
So it's very beautiful.

220
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,060
It involves a lot of clever ideas, things fit together nicely at the end, you can look

221
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,880
back on it and I think as a writer think what more could you possibly want?

222
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,120
It's as clean a proof as I could imagine.

223
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,360
And I think there's a culture in math textbooks that sort of says once something is proven

224
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,440
that means it is complete.

225
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,500
But if you try to add a secondary checklist that says what are the pedagogical considerations,

226
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,040
even though I think this is a great book and even though I think the proof has a lot of

227
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,200
staying power, there are dozens of other questions that I could think one might want to lead

228
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,400
up to this particular fact with or follow it with.

229
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,360
You know, to start off with you could just say what is this formula?

230
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
How do you think about it?

231
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,560
Why should you expect that something like this would be true?

232
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,040
What are the circumstances that you might run into in the mathematical wild where you

233
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,240
would think that this is something that you need to bring to bear?

234
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,200
For example, it doesn't hurt to illustrate just a little bit like how do we parse what

235
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,540
each side is saying?

236
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,140
The left hand side, which is adding up the value of the function for all of the positive

237
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,060
integers, you could kind of think of as an extremely coarse Riemann sum for the whole

238
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,200
function.

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,540
And one of the terms on the right hand side, if you take the Fourier transform just at

240
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,100
zero, those of you who are comfortable with matter know that that's just the same thing

241
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,440
as integrating the function.

242
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,300
And so what that tells you is that much of the left hand side is already encapsulated

243
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,900
just with the zeroth term on the right hand side.

244
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,340
And you know the student might then be invited to think about how all of the other Fourier

245
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,660
coefficients give you a sort of correction factor between the difference of this coarse

246
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,180
Riemann sum and the area.

247
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,100
That instills a little bit of intuition around if you have an especially smooth function,

248
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,060
one that stays very flat, that that would suggest that less correction is needed in

249
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,800
comparison to if it has high variation.

250
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,140
When it comes to the proof itself, while the author gave a delightful proof, there were

251
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,700
many steps where, like I said, it felt like it was handed down from on high.

252
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,300
And what I would love to see or would love to feel is a sense of how I might have discovered

253
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
that myself.

254
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,500
I think it's hard to understand just how delightful it can be if you as the reader feel like the

255
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,320
thing that was coming in is something that you kind of anticipated and that it's validating

256
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,060
rather than feeling like you're the one who has to kind of validate that the monument

257
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,120
that you were handed does the thing that's being claimed.

258
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,480
And in this case, you know, I think there's a longer description, but length isn't necessarily

259
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,980
the enemy that could provide a sort of path of rediscovery for the very elegant proof

260
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,320
that potentially could give it even more staying power.

261
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,240
Now what I mainly want to ask through the remainder of this talk is in light of the

262
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,280
fact that we have such a satisfying checklist for rigor that really distinguishes math and

263
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,280
which I think draws the attention of the mathematician and the writer so alluringly because of how

264
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,340
satisfying it is to go through that checklist and know that something's complete, is it

265
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,540
possible to have something that's analogous for those of us who want to popularize or

266
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,840
educate or otherwise communicate as clearly as is possible?

267
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,880
Is there something that has the same sort of itch-scratching satisfaction of, you know,

268
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
unambiguously knowing that you're there or you're not?

269
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,500
It's not a fuzzy realm where someone just qualitatively says this writing vaguely seems

270
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:09,180
better but is there an actual set of things that we could assign a binary value to?

271
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,420
And the reason I think that might be valuable is that, you know, a mathematician instinct

272
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,220
is one that sort of likes this notion of definiteness and so if we can put something a little bit

273
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,480
more definite wrapped around the indefinite realm of pedagogy that might be helpful.

274
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,220
So you could probably brainstorm a lot of things that might come to mind if you're

275
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
doing this.

276
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,020
A couple that I happen to write down here is, you know, does each definition that is

277
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,440
written down have a motivating example?

278
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,760
You know, a reason you would want to define something like that rather than seeing the

279
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,100
examples come after the proof, after the theorem and the like.

280
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,000
Do the proofs feel rediscoverable?

281
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,040
Like I said, it can be incredibly satisfying if a student feels like they knew what was

282
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,960
coming and whenever I put together videos I really try to focus on a path of rediscovery

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,820
which makes it longer but again I don't think length is necessarily the enemy as long as

284
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,760
you're not being verbose about it.

285
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,680
Another very simple consideration, maybe a little bit vague, a little bit hard to assign

286
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,880
that binary check to is does it feel personal?

287
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,920
Does it feel like an actual person is talking to you with a little bit of emotion and personality?

288
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,680
I think that matters when it comes to how engaged someone is with something and when

289
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,000
you're more engaged you remember things better.

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,360
Another simple one, just are there diagrams?

291
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,920
If something should be illustrated, is it illustrated?

292
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,080
This is one that's very near and dear to my heart as I'll get to in a moment but there's

293
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,320
all sorts of other things you might do and I would actually be curious what anyone else

294
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,200
in the audience thinks could be added to this checklist.

295
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,560
What I wanted to do for the remainder is talk through a couple points that I try to think

296
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,300
about as I'm putting together a piece of exposition, putting together a video.

297
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,800
It's not a complete checklist.

298
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,040
I don't think there exists such a thing as a checklist for pedagogy in quite the same

299
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
way that there's a checklist for rigor but I do think if we try to invite that into the

300
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,360
culture of math exposition the attempt to write down such a checklist could go a long

301
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,720
way.

302
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,020
So the channel that I run, it's for those of you unfamiliar, it's called 3Blue1Brown

303
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:07,060
and in a nutshell the premise is to give lessons that are as visualized as I possibly can make

304
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
them.

305
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,000
Not in a way that's superfluous, not in a way that has like flashiness for the sake

306
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,940
of production quality flashiness but instead for a given topic just make sure that each

307
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,880
statement that's made, if it makes sense to, has some kind of diagram that went along with

308
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,940
it or some kind of animation.

309
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,660
Part of this is because just as a hobby one of the things I delight in is programming

310
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,020
math animations so this was sort of a love child between two different interests of mine

311
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,780
which is teaching math and then programming animations.

312
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,860
But just to give a little bit of an illustration of what I have in mind and then to also try

313
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,460
to argue why sometimes making visuals like this isn't just a chore for the sake of adding

314
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,580
more pizzazz to a lesson but it can make it more interesting for the person putting together

315
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,100
the lesson.

316
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,220
I wanted to look at a video where the reason I made it was because of the visualizations

317
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,620
I was playing around with.

318
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,740
It wasn't that I wrote a script and then I started putting some kind of cartoon to the

319
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,980
script, it's instead that I was playing around with trying to visualize something and then

320
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,540
by seeing it in a certain way it gave me the framing for how I wanted to describe it to

321
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,800
others.

322
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,440
So the topic was the Riemann zeta function and in particular analytic continuation and

323
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,340
I opened the video with the usual motivations you might give for the Riemann zeta function,

324
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,540
the status that the Riemann hypothesis has, that it contains information relevant to the

325
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,980
primes, all of that.

326
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,220
But the meat was to simply answer the question for a casual viewer who's kind of interested

327
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,180
in math but don't necessarily want to assume they know too much already, what is it?

328
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,040
What is this function?

329
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,100
Which is of course a surprisingly intricate question to answer and half of the answer

330
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,500
is not that hard which is to look at a certain sum that defines it where you take zeta of

331
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,020
s to find it to be one over one to the s plus one over two to the s plus one over three

332
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,720
to the s, on and on.

333
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,700
So for example an especially fun value to plug in here is something like two where you're

334
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,780
adding up one plus one fourth plus one ninth plus one sixteenth, on and on and on.

335
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
The sum actually converges.

336
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,100
It was, you know, for one period in history a problem that nobody in Europe could seem

337
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
to figure out how to solve until one day Euler said, ah, I think I know the answer.

338
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,020
It's pi squared over six which is delightful and surprising and there's a lot of very fun

339
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,400
reasons why that comes about.

340
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,300
But for our purposes we don't really care about the connection to the circle or the

341
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,660
interesting discussions that you could have around the sum.

342
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,300
It's just that this is an example of a value of the sum.

343
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,380
It converges in this particular case.

344
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,180
And if you plug in some other exponents into that instead of two you can get things that

345
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,120
converge faster or things that converge slower.

346
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,600
It's a fun exercise just in calculus to ask what's the condition for whether it converges

347
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,880
or not.

348
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,360
And all around it makes sense when you have S bigger than one that this thing would mean

349
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,840
something because you have a bunch of terms that are getting smaller.

350
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,860
But if the casual reader were to be very inspired by something like the lore surrounding the

351
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,600
Riemann hypothesis and they find themselves on the Wikipedia page or they're poking around,

352
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,640
one of the things they might find is that sometimes into this function negative values

353
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
are plugged in.

354
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
And if they go back and they reference the definition they're like, hang on, okay, what

355
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
would that mean?

356
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,280
Because the zeta of negative one is negative one twelfth.

357
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,880
But that doesn't make sense because it's got one plus two plus three plus four and something

358
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,520
that gets bigger and bigger.

359
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,720
And then they go and they, you know, make videos about the sum of the natural numbers

360
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,000
equaling negative one twelfth and everyone gets mad at them and there's a whole kerfuffle

361
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,760
and you want to sit back and say, okay, okay, what is the actual statement being made here?

362
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,940
And for that you can't have the discussion unless before you get to negative values you

363
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,980
talk a little bit about positive values, sorry, complex values.

364
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,720
I suppose you can but the usual path is going through complex analysis.

365
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,980
So we'll think of it as a mapping, you know, for every input I'm going to draw the inputs

366
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,260
with a little yellow dot here and then the output of the function I'm drawing with a

367
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,580
little green dot here.

368
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,020
So the input two goes to the output pi squared over six.

369
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,620
And the question is if we extend our notion of, hey, what are all the possible inputs?

370
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,520
And instead we ask what would happen if I plugged in complex values?

371
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
So maybe I plug in something like two plus i, then what does that mean?

372
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,560
Now this is the kind of thing that assuming you have like a high school level of algebra,

373
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,780
it looks a little intimidating at first but it's not too much to parse and go through

374
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,180
step by step and say we can again with the aid of visuals really understand what's being

375
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
said here.

376
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,200
Because if you take one half to the power two plus i, that's something that assuming,

377
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,560
you know, power rules work the same way with complex numbers as they, as you've learned

378
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,680
they do with real numbers.

379
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,720
You understand half of it.

380
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
You understand the one half to the power two part.

381
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,520
And the only other thing to really explain is what it means to raise something to an

382
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,240
imaginary power.

383
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,480
And this is something that at this point on the channel I had like freshly made a video

384
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,240
on so it had a nice lead in for any people who are regular viewers.

385
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,680
Where the upshot of course is if you parameterize that exponent and you say, okay, maybe instead

386
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,840
of plugging in i, I imagine plugging in all other possible imaginary numbers, the output

387
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,480
that it gets sits somewhere on a unit circle.

388
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,640
And as I kind of move around that input up and down on the imaginary line, the output

389
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,560
kind of wanders around that circle rotating.

390
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,580
And it does so with a, you know, a constant rate if you're moving the yellow dotted constant

391
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,920
rate.

392
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,000
And the only thing to think about for the sake of the sum that we're going to do is

393
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,920
the fact that if it wasn't one half that sits at the base there but instead you had something

394
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,000
like one ninth, you're playing the same game, you're mapping the real, the imaginary line

395
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,900
onto the circle, but it moves a little bit faster.

396
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,320
So for a particular imaginary number that you plug in, it will have rotated a little

397
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,620
bit more.

398
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,980
And this gives such a satisfying way to think about the sum that we started with where let's

399
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:57,000
say initially you picture a nice real number input like our friend one half or one plus

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
a fourth plus a ninth on and on.

401
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,520
And you think of each of those terms as a little vector or just a little line with a

402
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,100
relevant length.

403
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,400
Then when you add some kind of imaginary part to that input, the lengths don't change.

404
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Those all stay the same.

405
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,020
So they're kind of like rigid lines, but each one of them rotates a little bit differently.

406
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,620
And for each successive term, they rotate a little bit more.

407
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,860
So what you end up with is a spiral.

408
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,380
And because the first one that you started with where all those lines were kind of stretched

409
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,940
out as far as they could be, if that converged, then certainly as you're spiraling it like

410
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,520
this, you would expect it to also converge.

411
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,800
So there's going to be some value, some complex number on the plane that is this output.

412
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,600
And here I got to just have a little bit too much fun after I had properly written the

413
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,720
program and say, okay, if we just grab that yellow dot corresponding to our input and

414
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,080
we move it around the plane and say for various other inputs, what does the spiral sum look

415
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
like?

416
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,160
You can just see what the corresponding output would be.

417
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,800
And most importantly, you can be reassured that it'll have some kind of meaningful output

418
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,940
as long as the original sum converged, which in our case basically means as long as the

419
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,120
real part of what you're starting with was bigger than one.

420
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,360
And so if we're thinking about what is this function, unambiguous, very happy, there's

421
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,360
nice convergence and it makes sense when the real part is bigger than one.

422
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,840
For the other part, it doesn't make as much sense yet.

423
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,380
But on the way to getting there, visualization can help just a little bit to nudge our minds

424
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,460
into something we might want to think about, where what I'm going to do is say, what if

425
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,780
we take not just one of the values that I could input in the right half of the plane,

426
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,780
what if we take all of them?

427
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,220
I'm going to take every single one of them and then I'm going to pump them through a

428
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,420
program that's going to spit out the corresponding output and I'm going to animate the movement

429
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,340
between input and output.

430
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,660
And I won't do it for literally everyone because that'll be dense and filling the plane, but

431
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,780
I'll put these grid lines up and then animate each point on those grid lines to kind of

432
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,260
represent what's going to happen to everything.

433
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,860
And this is one of those things where I had studied this, I had learned about the zeta

434
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,460
function, I had thought about it.

435
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,340
I didn't really know what was going to happen.

436
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,060
I didn't really know what this would look like afterwards.

437
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,480
One of the things that, sorry, go forward, is helpful to do is add a little bit more

438
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,260
density around the input one.

439
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,020
Those of you in the know might think about why you have to add some density around that

440
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,560
particular point.

441
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,960
And what comes out is basically the whole reason that I decided to make the video.

442
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,020
I hadn't necessarily been thinking of covering the Riemann zeta function or talking about

443
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,540
analytic continuation or anything like that.

444
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,040
But once you see this and you actually map all of the inputs, the whole diagram is just

445
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,700
sort of screaming at you how strange it is that there's an abrupt stop, right?

446
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,200
You can look at this and you can say, okay, there seems to be this line where everything

447
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
stops.

448
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,200
And one of the very fun things about this is there's all sorts of questions that I think

449
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,840
someone could ask if they're watching this that go way beyond anything that the video

450
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,440
talks about that can keep the interest even if it's an expert who feels very well familiar

451
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,700
with this concept.

452
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,080
For example, you could ask where is that line?

453
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,880
Eyeballing it, you might guess that it's around 0.5.

454
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,040
The actual answer is it's around Euler's constant, so it's a little above 0.5.

455
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,920
You can ask why is that the case?

456
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,760
Why does it look like a straight line at all?

457
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,880
Is it actually a straight line?

458
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Now I don't need to ask those questions, but the point I want to make is just that in trying

459
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,640
to visualize it, motivated by making it clearer for the broader public or clearer for a new

460
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,400
student, I think the act of doing that also raises the ceiling.

461
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,280
Done right, it actually makes it more interesting to someone who feels already familiar with

462
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,000
the concept.

463
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,640
So the way that the lesson proceeds from here is to essentially point out that because there's

464
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,920
this abrupt stop, this whole function seems like it's asking to be continued in some way.

465
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:49,440
Then maybe it's defined well using this sum for some of the complex numbers, but we might

466
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,040
have a conditional definition that says beyond those it equals something else.

467
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,640
The question is what should that something else be?

468
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,600
So if we imagined filling in the rest of the grid, I can preview what that something else

469
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:08,160
ends up looking like and it does have a kind of local symmetry, I should say.

470
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,680
One thing that's potentially misleading about the image is that it insinuates a kind of

471
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,200
symmetry entirely left and right on this, but later on in the video I draw out more

472
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,800
extensions of the lines to show that's not quite the case.

473
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,800
And this lends itself to just talking about something which is very peculiar to complex

474
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,840
functions that if a student hadn't been studying it would be a fun, novel fact, which is that

475
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,760
in a certain sense, even though it feels like you should have a lot of degrees of freedom

476
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,320
for what that continuation would be, you just kind of draw the function to do whatever you

477
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,040
want it to do for all of those other inputs.

478
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,920
While that is true if all you care about is defining some kind of function or if all you

479
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,920
do care about is constraining it by being continuous, say, what's surprising and the

480
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,480
fun fact to talk about and can be kind of an upshot of the video that hopefully has

481
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,520
a little bit of staying power is that if you want the constraint that your function has

482
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,840
a derivative everywhere, that that actually, if there's an extension at all, locks you

483
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,880
into only one choice, which is of course one of the fundamental intuitions under complex

484
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,160
analysis is how rigid the functions feel in contrast to real functions.

485
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,400
And from there, again, it's like if the constraint placed on describing math is to try to visualize

486
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,360
everything that's being said, this sentence kind of doesn't cut it.

487
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,500
You know, if I really wanted to go far, you don't just say derivative, we have to visualize

488
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,760
what a derivative means in this context.

489
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,200
And so the remainder of the video essentially does that, talks about notions of conformal

490
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,100
mappings and what the intuition is for how you would think about whether something is

491
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,640
derivative or not and the fact that completing this diagram is a sort of infinite continuous

492
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,040
jigsaw puzzle where every pair of lines that started off at a certain angle, you want them

493
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,100
to continue to have that angle and the like.

494
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,060
And all of this is just to mention one of the things that I like to keep in mind in

495
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,400
the checklist, which is maybe a little peculiar to my case because I've kind of gone hard

496
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,820
on this end of try to visualize every single thing, but which I think taken a little bit

497
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,540
more softly can be mapped to math exposition a little bit more broadly, which is to just

498
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,880
ask are the core ideas given diagrams.

499
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,460
You know, another, it sounds simple, but I think it can go so far.

500
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,160
There's another example that comes to mind where a friend of mine named Michael Nielsen

501
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,920
when he was a grad student wrote what then became like one of the Bibles of quantum computing

502
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,480
as far as textbooks are concerned.

503
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,700
And he wrote it with a collaborator, Isaiah Chuang, and I was asking him what the collaboration

504
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,620
process was like with that.

505
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,560
And Nielsen is a very like textual learner and thinker and he would say he would just

506
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,600
kind of go and just write out a whole bunch of text and descriptions essentially procrastinating

507
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,880
from his thesis is the way that he wrote this textbook, which is absurd if you know the

508
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,020
textbook at all.

509
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,360
And then he would send them along to his collaborator Chuang who would then point out, oh, this

510
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,160
needs a diagram, this needs a diagram and basically point out and then often fill out

511
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
the points that needed some kind of illustration.

512
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,160
And the medley was something very beautiful.

513
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,660
And I think that having a two person team like that enabled them to have this forcing

514
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,440
function where maybe Michael would have been a little bit less willing to write certain

515
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,640
sections if he had also been thinking about the effort that was going to be required to

516
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,760
illustrate every single one of them.

517
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,820
But with the mind free from having to think about that for himself and someone else taking

518
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,980
care of that, it felt like less of a chore maybe.

519
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,040
But again, I do kind of want to emphasize that even though it takes time to put together

520
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,760
visuals, you know, it doesn't have to.

521
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,120
I think just a pencil sketch or something simple in like whatever illustration software

522
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,200
is your favorite that it doesn't have to be precise.

523
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,280
It can be a simple sketch, can go a long way.

524
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,720
These don't have to be something that's purely for the student.

525
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,240
I think selfishly on the part of whoever's writing, say writing the textbook or putting

526
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,300
together a lecture or putting together a video, sometimes the visuals that you make actually

527
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,680
elicit new intuitions.

528
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,240
And the act of doing so, at least in my case, many, many times has deepened my own understanding

529
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
of something.

530
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,320
I feel fairly comfortable projecting that for others it stands to do the same.

531
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,360
This might be particular to programmatic animations more so than a lot of other things.

532
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,400
But I think almost everyone's familiar with the fact that when you're just trying to think

533
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,040
of something while lying on the couch, somehow it's dramatically less clear than when you

534
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,240
go to a whiteboard or you actually pull out your notes and then try to sketch something

535
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,460
related to it.

536
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,540
And letting it be something that's not just a nice to have but instead sits inside a checklist

537
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,260
of what does it mean for my piece to even be done, I think can help force that to come

538
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,460
about a little bit more.

539
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,980
Now the next thing that I like to think about, and this is one where, by the way, every single

540
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,420
time I do a first draft of something, I violate the principle that I'm about to describe and

541
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,300
then I have to go and realize, oh, wait, no, I should apply this principle.

542
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,920
There's something bizarrely unnatural about it, but I really do think it helps to make

543
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,700
things clearer.

544
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,860
To illustrate it, I'm going to talk about a much simpler piece of math.

545
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,380
And instead of doing zeta function type stuff, we're going to go to simple algebra, and I

546
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,780
mean like normal high school, middle school algebra, not abstract.

547
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,340
And I want you to kind of put yourself back in the state of mind whenever it is the case

548
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,740
that you were first learning just basic algebra, whatever age you were, whatever class you

549
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,380
might have been in.

550
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,100
And I'm going to paint two potential classes, and I want you to just think about how much

551
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,080
does each of those classes resonate with this imagined past version of yourself that's

552
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,520
sitting there learning it for the first time.

553
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,640
So the way that class A proceeds is like this.

554
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,500
The teacher starts by asking all of the students, can anyone factor the number 35 for me?

555
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,000
And actually I'll do this, why not?

556
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,200
Anyone in the audience, do you want to shout out the factors of 35?

557
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,620
Five and seven.

558
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Excellent.

559
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:48,000
Now, the teacher then asks the students, can anyone please factor the number 143 for me?

560
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,760
Because this is a room full of mathematicians, everyone immediately shouts 11 times 13, which

561
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
is fun.

562
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,340
But the students, you know, maybe they think about it a little bit more.

563
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,520
They check whether various numbers go into it.

564
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,240
And the one that does their little long division with the 11, they raise their hand with a

565
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,460
little bit more time than this crowd would and says 11 times 13.

566
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,780
So then the teacher asks, can anyone factor 3,599?

567
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,920
Now this is a fun room to do it in.

568
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,240
So 59 times 61, great.

569
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,680
I was, yeah.

570
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,240
This does not happen in middle schools.

571
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,920
Although I was recently doing something where I brought up this example in a room full of

572
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,360
high schoolers and there was one student who said it, he said the answer, he said it's

573
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,120
59 times 61.

574
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,440
And there was an audible gasp from the whole room.

575
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,800
Because it's absurd if you think about it factoring the normal way.

576
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,760
But the teacher says, you know, there's a reason that I let into it the way that I did.

577
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,200
And the teacher invites the students to think about how 35 is very close to a square number.

578
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,920
It's so close to something round.

579
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
It's close to 6 times 6.

580
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,680
And it maybe doesn't feel like a coincidence that the two factors are also close to 6.

581
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,800
It looks kind of like 6 times 6, but you just nudged one up, you nudged one down.

582
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,760
Similarly, 143, it's very close.

583
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,360
It's just one less than a square number, namely 12 times 12.

584
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,560
And it's not a coincidence that the factors, if you kind of squint your eyes, also look

585
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,840
like 12 times 12.

586
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,600
So if you're just pattern matching, then you might guess that the factor should look something

587
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,180
like 60 times something like 60.

588
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,440
And if it followed the same exact pattern, it would be one more and one less.

589
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,320
And you know, the teacher wants, they can go through a couple other examples like this,

590
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,440
start to convince the class that maybe, just maybe, this kind of wild fact is true.

591
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,760
And it lets you look like that person who can receive an audible gasp from all of your

592
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,900
classmates for being able to factor a number, which is very fun.

593
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,100
And then the teacher can draw out a diagram to help explain what's going on, where if

594
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,620
you imagine, you know, what does a square number mean, like 6 squared in this case,

595
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,000
you might imagine 6 by 6 boxes.

596
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,940
And if we subtract one, you're kind of kicking one off of the corner.

597
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,820
And if you rearrange this a little bit, what it means to try to factor the number is to

598
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,900
try to arrange all of your boxes into some kind of rectangle.

599
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,060
And in this case, we can do that where one of the rectangles has a width that's just

600
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,060
one bigger and, or the rectangle has a width that's one bigger and then a height that's

601
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,980
one smaller.

602
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,580
And you can actually generalize this, if instead of kicking off a corner that was just a little

603
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,260
one by one square, if you kicked off a y by y square, you can basically play the same

604
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,100
game to factor it to look like x plus y times x minus y.

605
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
And it's very fun.

606
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,160
Again, this gives you a lot of fun mental math tricks, where you can say things that

607
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,820
make you seem like a genius, where someone can say, factor the number 9,991, and you

608
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,940
can do it without a calculator.

609
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,580
Or on the flip side, it's a nice trick for multiplying certain numbers, assuming that

610
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,180
you know the square of what sits halfway in between them.

611
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,180
So that's class A. Class B starts off by saying, hello class, today we're going to be studying

612
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,660
the difference of squares formula.

613
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,620
The difference of squares formula states that if we take x squared minus y squared, this

614
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,060
can be factored into x plus y multiplied by x minus y.

615
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,820
The formula is very easy, it's not too hard to show, because if we expand out the right

616
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,900
hand side, you see that you have x squared, we subtract off yx, we add y times x, so those

617
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,000
two cancel out, and we get y squared.

618
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,520
The instruction really doesn't take long.

619
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,380
You can give an example, like if you plug in 1, it gives a nice fact that you can factor

620
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,520
something into x plus 1 and x minus 1.

621
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,220
And then there's a worksheet that you can kind of work through.

622
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,820
Which is, this is just a worksheet that I found when I was looking for classes on difference

623
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,460
of squares formula.

624
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,520
Now, okay, maybe I'm being a little bit unfair, not giving enough personality to the second

625
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,220
lesson as I could have.

626
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,240
But broadly speaking, you know, if we try to compare what's going on with these two,

627
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,320
class B does something which is so tempting to do in so many other contexts of math.

628
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,960
Which is that you start with the most powerful thing.

629
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,580
You state what the powerful thing is that you're going to do.

630
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,980
Usually that takes the form of an abstraction.

631
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,220
It's the most true thing.

632
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,340
You know, it's kind of easier to show in that case, this is part of what we love about abstraction,

633
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,660
is that it's just a lot quicker to verify that that's true than it is to try to, you

634
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,660
know, come up with some reason why a numerical case where you're gathering around a bunch

635
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,140
of squares or stones or whatever you're using to concretize it.

636
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,500
And even then, you know, the reasoning doesn't cover all the general cases necessarily.

637
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,820
Because you'd say, well, does it have to be an integer?

638
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,180
Would this work with negative numbers?

639
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,940
Would it work with complex numbers?

640
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,420
All of that.

641
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:26,160
So that's the temptation of class B. Class A teaches using data and examples.

642
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
And it's not that the abstraction isn't a goal.

643
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
It is the goal.

644
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,500
That's the function of the lesson at the end.

645
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,160
And it's not that you want to encourage students every single time that they come across the

646
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,140
difference of squares formula to picture in their head a little grid of X by X and Y.

647
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,100
Because sometimes you're just in the middle of doing a bunch of other algebra.

648
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,660
And the whole point of abstraction is that you don't have to think about that and you

649
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,500
can do it more quickly.

650
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,420
But I think for the first time that you're seeing it, if you really want it to land inside

651
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,980
yourself, it's more helpful to kind of think in terms of layers of abstraction where before

652
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,380
getting to the lesson you have in mind, shift yourself one abstraction layer lower instead

653
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,300
of in this case thinking about variables and letters, think about numbers.

654
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,600
And then if you show lots of different examples with those numbers, it's kind of like light

655
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,060
bulbs in the mind of the student that are thinking of all of those examples.

656
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,180
And if there's a certain, you know, ineffable character that connects them, the student

657
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,140
can kind of think about the things that connect them.

658
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,400
The fact that things feel close to squares or that the two factors that you got are suspiciously

659
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,420
close to the square root of the relevant number.

660
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,360
And when we did the diagram, in a sense that's an abstraction layer even lower where instead

661
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,260
of thinking of numbers and numerals representing amounts, you're just looking at the amounts

662
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,880
and you can see the connection between the numerical facts that got you to feel like

663
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,760
a wizard and something more direct with those amounts.

664
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,200
And by the time you get to the abstraction, it feels so cool and so powerful because you

665
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,640
have a sense for all of the different things underneath that it's touching, all of the

666
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,320
different mental math tricks that are encapsulated in such a beautiful and concise formula.

667
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,440
It seems a little banal to those of us once you're comfortable with algebra because, you

668
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,880
know, it's just one identity out of many.

669
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,720
But I think, you know, reminding students that every identity that you see in algebra

670
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,600
kind of encapsulates this whole body of potential mental math tricks or potential, you know,

671
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,920
statements about a wide variety of little diagrams you could draw out.

672
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,040
There's something about that that feels very inspiring, to me at least.

673
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,780
Now class B in contrast, it teaches the same topic.

674
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,520
It gives you the same ultimate fact.

675
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,200
Assuming the students remember the fact, you know, I can't imagine that they would test

676
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,680
much more poorly, at least if you do the test with this kind of worksheet that they got

677
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,000
their practice on shortly after the lesson.

678
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,320
I might question whether they remember the formula as well if you ask them five years

679
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,080
later or something like that.

680
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,720
But if I'm trying to picture what's going on in the kind of depiction of, this isn't

681
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,480
literally what's happening in the brain, but you know my schematic for layers of abstraction

682
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,520
in the brain, you're just sort of lighting up the one bulb you care about and it's not

683
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,560
sitting on something else to support it.

684
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
It hasn't been brought about.

685
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,240
There wasn't a sense that it was answering a question or articulating a pattern that

686
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,560
already existed in someone's mind.

687
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,240
So this is a thing I like to think about as much as I can, where if there's a given topic,

688
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,520
you know, I try to draw out what are the relevant layers of abstraction at play here.

689
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,360
Now there's not like a universal hierarchy or something like that, but just as an example

690
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,480
for what that might look like, you know, at the bottom most layer we have things like

691
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
quantities.

692
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,160
One of the very first things we do when we're teaching students math is to get them to go

693
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,680
from feeling comfortable with quantities to thinking comfortably with numerals.

694
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,440
And you know, eventually everyone gains a certain fluency with this.

695
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,520
Maybe there's a couple bumps in the road while they're learning about fractions and doing

696
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,960
that, but by and large everyone kind of gets that layer of abstraction.

697
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,220
And then similarly at some point, instead of talking about numerals, we realize that

698
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,080
there's just a lot of facts that are nicer encapsulated with algebra and symbols.

699
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,440
And you just communicate more, you can think more quickly with respect to certain things.

700
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,440
And it's such a powerful tool.

701
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,160
The next layer is, it's not exactly the case that like functions abstract the notion of

702
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,240
algebra, but kind of it's the case that certain, let's say facts and calculus that you're learning,

703
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,020
you draw out with respect to functions where every instantiation of that function that

704
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,800
might come along looks like either algebra or some bit of trigonometry or something there.

705
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,760
And so you write out your facts about derivatives and integrals and chain rule and the like,

706
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,920
not with respect to specific functions, but instead just in a more abstract setting.

707
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,720
And again, the next layer is maybe a little bit silly to think of as like a definitive

708
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,200
canonical one, but there's a sense in which functions are a single instance of, or function

709
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,560
spaces at least, like a collection of functions, an instance of vector spaces.

710
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,080
And a lot of the facts that you might have around functions can fit into a more general

711
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,500
framework where things like the derivative and the integral you could think of in terms

712
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,720
of linear mappings and the like.

713
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,400
And of course you keep going on and on and on until people get talking to you about higher

714
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,640
categories and it's just a snake that eats its own tail up there.

715
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,560
But the point is that whatever layer you're sitting on here, you know, I give an example

716
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,800
in a low set of those layers between numerals and algebra, but I think even at higher layers,

717
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,000
I just personally think that it's very helpful for the first time that a student sees something

718
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,800
to populate their mind with data of a lower layer before you articulate the higher layer,

719
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,020
even if the goal is the higher layer.

720
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,160
So if you're teaching linear algebra, for example, even though the whole beauty of linear

721
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:26,840
algebra is the generality, the fact that it's not just describing R2 and R3 and the like,

722
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,080
but that there's a whole body of things that you can model with vector spaces and then

723
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,180
use facts that you've derived very rigorously just from the axioms to come to conclusions

724
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,880
about all the different things that could be vector spaces.

725
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,320
Nevertheless the intuition building phase is probably best done if you populate it with

726
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,840
a bunch of examples.

727
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,700
Maybe it's good to spread out not just from R2 and R3, but certain other examples of more

728
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,440
playful vector spaces that one might come up with.

729
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,420
I think one example that comes to mind as just an excellent example to get someone starting

730
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,320
to think about more abstract vector spaces is magic squares.

731
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,700
And if you teach them the notion of a three by three magic square where all of the columns

732
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,080
and rows and such have to add up to a certain amount, you then ask someone how many dimensions

733
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,640
is the space of all magic squares and you know what's a basis for the magic squares.

734
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,160
And that kind of question can get them thinking, again it's very concrete, it's a specific

735
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,860
instance, it's a very specific kind of vector space, but that starts to invite them to think

736
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,840
about what's common across the arrows drawn in 2D space examples that they might have

737
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,800
cut their teeth on earlier.

738
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,640
So with my checklist I think what this means is I try to ask are abstractions preceded

739
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,880
with concrete examples.

740
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,920
And like I said, for whatever reason this is one that the first draft, if I write something,

741
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,380
just doesn't do it.

742
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,760
And I think it's because once you understand something, the way you think about it, at

743
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,060
least the way I think about it, tends to be from the abstraction down.

744
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,160
It's frankly a lot easier to think about the difference of squares formula algebraically

745
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,520
than it is to try to think about a bunch of mental math tricks or a grid of squares or

746
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
anything like that.

747
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,420
It's just so quick to verify.

748
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,960
And then this goes for a lot of other things where the reason we do the abstractions is

749
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,200
because it allows for more mental fluency.

750
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,480
But then that often can give us a mistake that it means as you're divulging the topic,

751
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,820
the thing that is easiest for you, the expert, is necessarily the thing that is most conducive

752
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,960
to a new learner coming in.

753
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,760
And so by specifically writing it out and letting it be one of the checks, I think it

754
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,900
can shift my lessons hopefully to be the better.

755
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,720
Now the last one I'd like to talk about is actually something I've only more recently

756
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,840
started thinking about.

757
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,940
And it's hard to do in videos and I'm curious about if there's ways to kind of do it better.

758
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,960
It's definitely applicable in classrooms.

759
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,280
I think done with good writing it's applicable in textbooks.

760
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,700
But one nice thing to illustrate it is a certain study by Manu Kapoor, even gave a certain

761
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,100
TED talk about studies like this.

762
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,880
But the one that caught my eye is this paper called Productive Failure in Learning Math.

763
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,760
And he focuses on the nature of failure, but to my mind that's not even the most interesting

764
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
part.

765
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,440
The neat thing here is he has two different classes that he teaches or that in the experiment

766
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,760
are taught to a group of middle school students.

767
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,960
And the middle school students are segregated into two different groups in class A. They

768
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,320
experience two hours.

769
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,240
One is an instruction phase and following that is a problem solving phase.

770
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,800
And the only difference with the second class, the only difference is that they flip the

771
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,800
order.

772
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,520
They did a one hour problem solving phase followed by the instruction phase.

773
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,960
And the example matters here because I don't think you can do this for any kind of problem

774
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,700
solving, but it was a well chosen problem solving prompt in the case of this class because

775
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,780
they were teaching the idea of standard deviation.

776
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,800
And the question that they asked was to present the students with two different basketball

777
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,960
players and they give a whole bunch of data over the course of a season of basketball

778
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,300
for how many points each one of those players scored.

779
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,780
And they were told Mike and Dave are two basketball players and an award has to be given to the

780
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,300
most consistent player of the two.

781
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,580
And the decision has to be made mathematically and so the students were invited to design

782
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,820
as many measures of consistency as they could to determine which of those players is more

783
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,820
consistent.

784
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,960
It's a very fun exercise actually and so the middle schoolers were given 60 minutes

785
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,620
to think about this, to look over the data, try to add some things up, use their calculators

786
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,100
if they could, come up with some measure of consistency.

787
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,220
And a couple of things came out of it.

788
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,460
One of them is that the students in that second one that did the problem solving phase before

789
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,820
they did the instruction, they reported that the instruction phase was harder, that they

790
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,940
were spending more mental energy on it.

791
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:44,180
Now another relevant thing is the number of tactics they came up with, it was a lot higher.

792
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:48,620
There was a lot more variation in the measures of consistency they came up with when they

793
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,300
hadn't been taught the proper lesson yet.

794
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,820
But the most interesting thing to me at least is when they did a post test on all of this

795
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,320
and they had just questions trying to measure how well the students understood the topic

796
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,100
of standard deviation.

797
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,580
The questions broke into various different categories.

798
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,460
So the ones that were categorized as procedural knowledge, just are you able to carry out

799
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,380
the computation and all that, there wasn't really much of a difference between the two

800
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,380
camps.

801
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,300
But the ones that the researchers marked as measuring conceptual understanding, it was

802
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,860
like two standard deviations higher in conceptual understanding that the second group had compared

803
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,640
to the first.

804
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,000
And then questions that were marked as measuring how transferable the knowledge was, were they

805
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,600
able to transfer it to a different context.

806
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,400
It was like one standard deviation higher.

807
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,720
And on the one hand, you kind of always have to take a little bit of a grain of salt with

808
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,960
education studies and especially if they're small sample sizes and things like that.

809
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,920
But to me at least, this one rings very true, the idea that if you seriously engage with

810
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,920
a problem before you're told the answer, that that actually makes you engage more meaningfully

811
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,040
with the answer once it's told to you in the instruction.

812
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,540
So I think probably a lot of people in this room have had the experience of toying over

813
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,880
some problem, not because it was assigned for homework after a given class was given,

814
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,840
but because for whatever reason you just were interested in that problem.

815
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,400
And then maybe a little bit later, maybe a couple years later, you come across someone

816
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,920
who's answering that problem.

817
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,380
They happen to articulate exactly the thing you were looking for.

818
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,320
In my experience, that answer sticks so much better than the answers that are given for

819
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,440
questions that I hadn't yet been thinking about or toiling over.

820
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,640
So the third thing that I put on this checklist is does the lesson start with some kind of

821
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,440
motivating question?

822
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,900
Like I said, I think that's kind of hard to do with video because you have to invite the

823
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,200
audience to pause and think about it, which some people will do, and that's great.

824
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,300
But like realistically, a lot of people are a little bit more passive in that moment.

825
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,680
So it seems like something that's much better done in conjunction with instruction, whether

826
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,440
that instruction comes in the form of a video or a textbook or something like that.

827
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,320
You know, I think a good author with a textbook can kind of do a lot to at the very least

828
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,480
precede the relevant sections with the right questions, maybe even give some stern, you

829
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,880
know, suggestions to the reader that no, really, stop, think about this.

830
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,100
If you really want to engage with it, if you really want to remember it, like take five

831
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,880
minutes to close the book and think about this question.

832
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,240
But whatever form it takes, I think when the student has actually engaged with something

833
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,400
like this, it stands to make the instruction itself land a lot more.

834
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,880
And it's not something I've always done.

835
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,060
So that's a thing I've been thinking about more and how I can bring that into the future.

836
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,400
So I'm curious, actually, you know, what other people would add to this list and what principles

837
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,960
they have for a checklist of pedagogy.

838
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,720
And just to reiterate the point, I do think that the reason that it's important to have

839
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,440
something like this rather than just letting it be subjective and fuzzy is because, you

840
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,600
know, those of us who are mathematically interested, we have a kind of attraction to

841
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,840
the definite.

842
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:54,920
And the allure of something that's like exact in the sense that rigor is exact is so tempting

843
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,600
that it can sometimes mean we lose sight of the other forms of completion that are just

844
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,860
as worthy.

845
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:04,220
And I also want to reiterate, it's not a statement that, you know, rigor and clarity necessarily

846
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,680
sit in contrast with each other.

847
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,940
The best authors definitely achieve both at the same time.

848
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,140
It's just when we care about something like clarity with the same verve that we care about

849
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:17,620
something like rigor, with the same sense of satisfaction that comes from looking over

850
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,340
a piece and saying, yes, I can officially check this off.

851
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,820
That's something that feels like it's achievable when you're looking for a slight cultural

852
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:30,860
shift, whereas fuzzier descriptions like we need to do better just aren't going to apply.

853
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,380
So with that, I'd like to thank you all for coming.

854
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
And thank you.

855
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,660
Thank you.

856
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
Thank you, Grant.

857
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,460
That was a lot of fun.

858
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:58,260
For those of us like myself who grew up in a time when a colored chalk was considered

859
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:05,220
innovative, this was a very refreshing and eye-opening look at the ways that new

860
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,560
ideas and technologies can help inform our work.

861
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:15,940
And I think the age of digital textbooks and other kinds of interactive things that combine

862
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:21,780
some of the elements you're talking about are going to offer some very exciting opportunities.

863
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,880
We do have a little time for questions.

864
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,020
We have a couple of microphones in the aisles, and I would invite you to line up there or

865
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,100
come to those microphones if you'd like to ask a question.

866
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,100
I think, Grant, you're up for that, right?

867
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Yeah, yeah.

868
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,980
So, love to answer any questions.

869
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,460
And I'll stick around outside of the ballroom afterwards if people want to come say hello.

870
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,700
I'm not sure what the protocol here is, but let's say whoever's standing there at the

871
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
mic first.

872
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,700
Hi.

873
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:56,060
I just wanted to ask you about, in sort of exploring this idea of presenting data first

874
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:02,260
and this concrete information before getting to abstraction, do you have any thoughts on

875
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,420
sort of in that process teaching students that you're not always going to see it, you're

876
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,460
not always going to see it the first time, and getting students comfortable with the

877
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:15,980
idea that math can be hard and this is an exploratory process that isn't necessarily

878
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,060
targeted at getting to the abstraction first thing?

879
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:24,660
Yeah, I think that's such a good point, that even if the back of the mind goal of the expositor

880
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:30,200
is that you've set up this stage so very carefully that surely anyone will follow up to the conclusion,

881
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,120
setting the expectations with everyone that epiphany is very rare and discovery is something

882
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,340
to be cherished and if it was something that could happen all the time it wouldn't be as

883
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,640
lovely as it is.

884
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,120
I'm not sure of the best ways to do that other than saying it in words and just kind of reassuring

885
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:51,320
now and then like, hey, it's okay if you don't see this yet or maybe holding off from a temptation

886
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,920
to use phrases like obviously or clearly and things of the like.

887
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,400
But it's an important point to bring up.

888
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
I appreciate that.

889
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
On the right side here.

890
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,880
Yeah, so there's a phrase that I've heard a couple of times which is when teaching math

891
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,000
you should teach the truth, nothing but the truth but never the whole truth.

892
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,240
How do you decide at what point, especially if you're teaching younger students, whatever

893
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,840
that means, where it's good to give intuition rather than full rigor, how do you decide

894
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,880
at which point to no longer be rigorous?

895
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,880
That's a great question.

896
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:38,660
I think you can always be honest about when you're being hand-wavy.

897
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,560
Feynman was especially good at this with the Feynman lectures I know because like physics

898
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,120
is an exercise of constantly lying to people less and less over the course of their education

899
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,040
and he did a good job of like calling out the lies as they took place, saying this is

900
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:55,380
a simplifying assumption and I don't think it takes that long and so you can maybe tip

901
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:02,220
your hat to the fact that there might be certain exceptions in certain cases or to

902
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,500
the extent that's possible you try to limit the scope of what you're saying such that

903
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,560
if there is more complexity outside of it you're just crystal clear about the setup

904
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,180
as you go in.

905
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,660
One other brief thought you said, teach the truth and nothing but the truth, one direction

906
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:22,740
I thought you were going with that was like when is it fruitful to have little falsehoods

907
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,820
through the lesson?

908
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:31,580
I think one form of exposition that is potentially really nice and a friend of mine gave a name

909
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:40,420
to it of discovery fiction is to try to map out a sequence of events that could lead to

910
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,740
the discovery of a certain topic.

911
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,060
It doesn't have to match the actual history of how something was discovered but often

912
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,740
the shape of it is that you come up with an idea that's just flawed and then you try to

913
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,580
fix it a little bit and fix that flaw and then that has another flaw and then you fix

914
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,160
it a little bit and then that has a flaw.

915
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,340
And as you proceed like this sometimes it does a good job motivating why very seemingly

916
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:02,420
arbitrary constructs are put in place to solve a certain problem and the funny thing about

917
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:08,860
that process is that through most of the lesson you're describing something that is wrong

918
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,700
or something that's not actually useful in the sense that the construct that's sitting

919
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,120
in state in that moment isn't ever going to be used, it's just an intermediate step along

920
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,120
the way.

921
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,360
So I think trying to adhere too much to making sure that at every single step along the way

922
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:29,340
the objects that you're dealing with really work or the statements are fully true, it's

923
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:34,080
not always helpful to be constrained like that assuming that you're very honest with

924
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:40,200
the reader or the audience about where those falsehoods are and why and how they need to

925
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
be corrected.

926
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,880
All right, other question on the left?

927
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,720
Yeah, so suppose you have somebody you want to convey, some kind of cool fact you want

928
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,720
to talk about.

929
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,600
So I'm sure this is part of your process but I didn't see it as one of your checks or as

930
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,400
one of your items so I was wondering like where this comes in the process.

931
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,720
I mean presumably it has to be early on but the idea of what is the right way to think

932
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
about this?

933
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,360
I mean this has to be before planning the whole video because you have to decide like

934
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,140
I want to get to here, what is the route?

935
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:10,240
How much time do you spend thinking about what is the right way to think about the final

936
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,240
thing and do you actually have that as one of your checks, items that you didn't list?

937
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:19,480
Yeah, I guess I exist in such a fortuitous situation where I choose the things that I

938
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,680
teach which is not always the case and so I get to do this really luxurious thing where

939
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,600
I just ambitiously learn about a lot of stuff and it only ever bubbles to the point of wanting

940
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,280
to make a video about it when it feels like there's that cool thing to show which is often

941
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,360
a slightly different perspective or something that was at least different to me and so in

942
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,320
a lot of ways it's like it's the zeroth law on that list, right?

943
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,140
It's the thing that makes it get there.

944
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,520
Now the challenge mode question is suppose you don't live such a luxurious existence

945
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,660
and instead you have an explicit set of things that you're supposed to teach.

946
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:57,180
You know, I don't think there is like the right way to view it necessarily but what

947
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:02,860
I have found is like I said I really like to play around with visualizations of stuff.

948
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,900
Sometimes just doing a sort of brain dead thing to take the important formula and just

949
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,700
slowly unpack what each part looks like has been like more fruitful than I would have

950
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:18,020
expected so one topic that in a certain sense I didn't choose to make, just a lot of people

951
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,620
were requesting it was Fourier transforms.

952
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,820
I'm like I don't have anything to say about Fourier transforms but there's a lot of requests

953
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,980
and I'm like okay what can we say here and honestly the video I made it was just I like

954
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,740
look at the definition of it and I started the innermost part and I'm like how would

955
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,740
you draw this?

956
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,740
Okay how would you draw how these relate?

957
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,740
Okay how would you draw these?

958
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,100
Now that we have this drawing how would you interpret it?

959
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,140
How does that drawing change as you tweak this parameter?

960
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,660
And kind of literally coding it up along the way but I don't think you have to I think

961
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:48,740
it could have just been a whiteboard sketch and the video ended up really resonating with

962
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:54,180
people and I think it was just a nice lesson for me that there didn't have to be a priori

963
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,700
some great aha that was had that sometimes just the seemingly brain dead thing where

964
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,960
you go step by step with this strong requirement of having an image in the head for what each

965
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,860
part means goes farther than a lot of people might appreciate.

966
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,800
Now it can only be done on the important formulas because it's such a time consuming

967
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,020
process that you wouldn't want for every single thing that comes up in a given lecture to

968
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,220
be like oh and how do we visualize this?

969
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,220
How do we visualize this?

970
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,420
You would just never get anywhere not just in that lecture but in the whole course but

971
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:28,640
if you're judicious about which parts deserve that level of deep dive I actually think it's

972
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,500
kind of a fruitful exercise and whatever topic is maybe sitting in the back of your mind

973
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,460
when you ask the question it's like maybe a fun exercise to sit down and go from the

974
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,260
inside out saying just what would you draw if you had to communicate non-linguistically

975
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,700
with someone to convey the idea.

976
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,300
Over here.

977
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:51,220
Hi Grant, thanks so much for the talk, very enjoyable and enlightening.

978
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:57,660
My question is how you think that this sort of pedagogy checklist is influenced by students'

979
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,980
desire to learn because fortunately you know speaking of luxury I think it's fair to say

980
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,220
that you're in a position where most of the people that you get to teach nowadays are

981
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:11,220
people who are there on purpose and they want to be but we've all had the experience

982
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,220
of having to teach students who really don't want to learn what you're trying to teach

983
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:23,220
them so how do you think the checklist can maybe be modified in consideration of the

984
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:28,740
fact that a lot of the time in a university setting or especially in a primary or secondary

985
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,680
school setting there's going to be quite a few students who really are not interested

986
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,440
in learning what you want to teach them.

987
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,440
Such a good question.

988
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:41,680
I mean there's, do any of you listen to the podcast An Opinionated History of Math by

989
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
chance?

990
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
No?

991
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,680
Oh, you'll love it.

992
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,520
It's one of my favorite, it's so obscure and like niche but it's so delightful but the

993
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,600
author of it has on his website this little manifesto about teaching and he lists out

994
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,720
like the axioms of learning and one of his axioms of learning is essentially your point

995
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,400
like people are not, how does he phrase it, he's so much more articulate than I am but

996
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,600
essentially in order for someone to actually learn they have to want to learn ahead of

997
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,600
time and so you're right I'm in a luxurious position although you know it is the case

998
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,320
that like every YouTuber thinks about how do you bring someone into the topic if they

999
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,960
might not have been thinking about it and a couple of the standard things for that is

1000
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,840
like you try to appeal to a thing that interested them before they even walked in the room or

1001
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,560
before they clicked on the video.

1002
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,520
A loose example here, I'm not going to claim that things like this will always apply in

1003
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:37,440
the classroom but I think maybe some examples do and it's worth inviting.

1004
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,080
I guess last year now I made this video about Wurtle which was really on one hand is jumping

1005
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:47,200
on a hype train because nothing was more popular on the internet than Wurtle but it was an

1006
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:54,300
excuse to teach information theory and I can definitively say it reached more people than

1007
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:59,580
it would have if I had said I want to do a lesson about information theory and I also

1008
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,580
think to good effect.

1009
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,660
There was one person who told me that it helped him get a job because there was an interview

1010
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:08,420
that he did where a question about Shannon entropy came up and like he had freshly watched

1011
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,420
the video.

1012
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,600
He probably would have gotten the job anyway but I'll take all the credit I can get here

1013
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:18,060
but something like that was I think you know maybe a very special example but there's probably

1014
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,580
a lot of different cases where you can find some connection to a thing that maybe isn't

1015
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,560
in the zeitgeist but is of a pre-existing interest to the students and just letting

1016
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,900
yourself take a little bit of time at the start of a class to let that be a motivating

1017
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,220
example might go a long way.

1018
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:38,180
The other thing I really do think clarity motivates like on the one hand yes it is very

1019
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:43,300
helpful to have someone who's already interested in learning and they sit there and they're

1020
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,940
willing to absorb whatever you're going to give them regardless of the clarity but I

1021
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:52,660
also think if you take the time to have something like a compelling diagram to really illustrate

1022
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:57,740
what's going on that is something that doesn't just feed pre-existing interest but it can

1023
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:02,820
generate interest in the first place and there's a lot of people who've like told me that that

1024
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,300
was the thing about the channel that got them sucked in that they hadn't cared about the

1025
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:10,860
channel at all before but they started watching it because it you know it elucidated something

1026
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:16,140
that was a class they were taking or something like that and so they do feed into each other

1027
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:21,500
but broadly speaking I think what you bring up is another excellent example of something

1028
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,500
to sit on the checklist which is essentially do you have a compelling reason to believe

1029
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,340
that the audience sitting in front of you cares to listen to what you're saying.

1030
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,980
Maybe we do one more?

1031
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,940
Oh we better call it?

1032
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,620
Alright I will happily stand outside the the barroom after to say hello to folks but thank

1033
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:44,140
you everyone for coming and have a great rest of your day.

1034
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,660
And as as Grant said he is willing to hang out a little bit so maybe you can catch some

1035
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,580
of he can catch some of your other questions.

1036
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,420
Thank you so much for being here.
