1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Two, then four, then eight, and then sixteen.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,800
It's very nice.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,620
Before I go on with this particular pattern, there's a fun story about it.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,580
A little known fact.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,440
Do you guys know the song Hallelujah, the one popular from Trent?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,620
Yeah, okay.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,320
We all know the song.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,560
Lots of different artists have played it.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,720
The original artist was Leonard Cohen.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,880
He was the one who wrote the lyrics.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,014
Few people know, he actually went through many, 

12
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,500
many different iterations of what the song would be.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,600
And ultimately it ended up as this biblical devastation of love.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,560
But one of the earlier versions was about this particular pattern in math.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,860
It's true.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,220
100% true.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,100
Leonard Cohen was a low-key math buff.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,381
And I thought it might be fun, just because I don't want the original 

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,424
version to get lost in the annals of history, to share with you guys 

20
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:56,585
what this would have sounded like, if history had turned out that way, 

21
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:00,980
if he didn't make it about love and religion and all of those great things.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,400
So welcome to the stage yet again, to accompany on keynote Matt Parker.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:03:48,120
Wonderful.
