1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Two, then four, then eight, and then sixteen.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,800
It's very nice.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,620
Before I go on with this particular pattern, there's a fun story about it.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,580
A little known fact.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,440
Do you guys know the song Hallelujah, the one popular from Trent?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,320
Yeah, okay. We all know the song.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,560
Lots of different artists have played it.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,720
The original artist was Leonard Cohen.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,880
He was the one who wrote the lyrics.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,740
Few people know, he actually went through many, many different iterations

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,500
of what the song would be.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,600
And ultimately it ended up as this biblical devastation of love.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,560
But one of the earlier versions was about this particular pattern in math.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,220
It's true. 100% true.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,100
Leonard Cohen was a low-key math buff.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,180
And I thought it might be fun, just because I don't want the original version to get lost in the annals of history,

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,320
to share with you guys what this would have sounded like,

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,980
if history had turned out that way, if he didn't make it about love and religion and all of those great things.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,640
So welcome to the stage yet again,

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,400
to accompany on keynote Matt Parker.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,580
Wonderful.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,160
And I know I know Leonard Cohen, but just imagine if you're watching Shrek and when they get to that typical moment

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,860
when you don't think love is going to hold, you've actually heard the proper original.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,720
Well I heard there was a sequence of chords

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,840
Splits the circle to one, two, then four

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,920
And points seem to cut in powers of two

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Yeah, it was run like this

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,300
With fourth and fifth

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,820
But something's up

30
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,440
We go out at six

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,260
It's awesome 31

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,460
I had a piece for you

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll make it for you

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,260
I'll make it for you

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,640
I'll make it for you

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,400
I'll make it for you

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll make it for you

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,140
Yeah

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,440
When your faith is strong you still need proof

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,400
What's your faith?

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,740
Death can lead to a dew

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,700
Each integral up on the left is pi over two

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,240
Yeah

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,280
I think that's true

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,720
For the next, which is terrible like a drum

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,900
We've shown that it's off by a hair

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,440
It's a subtle slip but it's true

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,940
I had a piece for you

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,120
I had a piece for you

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,460
I'll make it for you

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,040
I'll make it for you

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:01,260
I'll make it for you

53
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,400
Now take a prime and write it in Facebook

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
It's just like you had before

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,420
This prime gives a new prime

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,220
With this rule, yeah

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,520
Or does it though?

58
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,500
It'll eventually find new primes or not

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,160
So send design patterns hold

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,820
Then they're broken

61
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,920
How they fool you

62
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,440
They rule you

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,980
How they fool you

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,480
How they fool you

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,780
How they fool you

66
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,660
That's it, I'm just guitarring
