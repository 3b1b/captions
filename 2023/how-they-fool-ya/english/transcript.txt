Two, then four, then eight, and then sixteen. 
It's very nice. 
Before I go on with this particular pattern, there's a fun story about it. 
A little known fact. 
Do you guys know the song Hallelujah, the one popular from Trent? 
Yeah, okay. 
We all know the song. 
Lots of different artists have played it. 
The original artist was Leonard Cohen. 
He was the one who wrote the lyrics. 
Few people know, he actually went through many, many different iterations of what the song would be. 
And ultimately it ended up as this biblical devastation of love. 
But one of the earlier versions was about this particular pattern in math. 
It's true. 
100% true. 
Leonard Cohen was a low-key math buff. 
And I thought it might be fun, just because I don't want the original version to get lost in the annals of history, to share with you guys what this would have sounded like, if history had turned out that way, if he didn't make it about love and religion and all of those great things. 
So welcome to the stage yet again, to accompany on keynote Matt Parker. 
Wonderful.
