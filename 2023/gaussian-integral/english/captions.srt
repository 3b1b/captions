1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
You may have heard the phrase,

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,960
the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,920
This was the title of a paper by the physicist Eugene Wigner,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,440
but even more fun than the title is the way that he chooses to open it.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
The paper begins, quote,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
There is a story about two friends who were classmates in high school,

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
talking about their jobs.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
They showed a reprint to their former classmate,

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,360
and the reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,920
The statistician explained to the former classmate

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, the average population, and so on.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
The classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,160
whether the statistician was pulling their leg.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,080
How can you know that? was the query.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,160
And what is this symbol over here?

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
Oh, said the statistician, this is pi.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,760
What is that?

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,120
The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Well, now you're pushing the joke too far, said the classmate.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,920
Surely the population has nothing to do with the circumference of a circle.

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,920
In the paper, Wigner then goes on to talk about the more general phenomenon of concepts and pure math

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,800
seeming to find applications that extend strangely beyond what their definitions would suggest.

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,000
But I would like to stay focused on this particular anecdote

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
and the question that the statistician's friend is getting at.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,440
You see, there is a very beautiful and classic proof

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,120
that explains the pi inside the formula for a normal distribution.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,720
And despite there being a number of other really great explanations online,

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
see some links in the description,

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
I cannot help but indulge in the pleasure of reanimating it here.

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,280
For one thing, there is a fun side note that I didn't learn until recently

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
about how you can use this proof to derive the volumes of higher dimensional spheres.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
But much more importantly than that,

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,360
what I really want to do is try to go beyond the classic proof.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,160
Consider this hypothetical statistician's friend.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,560
What I want to ask is, can we find an explanation that would satisfy their disbelief?

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600
You see, they're not just asking for some pure math proof

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
about a function that was handed down to them on high.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,000
The friend's incredulity was that circles should have anything to do with population statistics.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,240
Until we fully draw that connecting line, we should consider the task incomplete.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,520
Those of you who watched the last video on the central limit theorem

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
will have some of the backdrop here,

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
because there we broke down the formula for a normal distribution,

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
which is also called a Gaussian distribution.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
And when you strip away all of the different parameters and the constants,

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
the basic function that describes the bell curve shape is e to the negative x squared.

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
And the reason that pi showed up in the final formula

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,160
was that the area underneath this curve works out,

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
as you will see in a couple minutes, to be the square root of pi.

50
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,280
So what that meant for us was that at some point we needed to divide out

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,960
by that square root of pi to make sure that the area under the curve is one,

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,720
which is a requirement before you can interpret it as a probability distribution.

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,880
In the full formula that you would see, say, in a stats book,

54
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,520
this gets mixed together with some of the other constants,

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,000
but in its purest form that pi originates from the area underneath this curve.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,720
So step number one for you and me is to explain that area,

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,200
but I want to emphasize it's not the last step.

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,280
To satisfy the question raised by that hypothetical statistician's friend,

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
we need to go further.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
We need to also answer why is it that this function e to the negative x squared

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
is so special in the first place?

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,280
I mean, there are lots of different formulas you could write down

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,160
that would give a shape that, you know, vaguely bulges in the middle

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,400
and tapers out on either side.

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,880
So why is it that this specific function holds such a special place in statistics?

66
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,880
To phrase our goal another way, can we find a connection

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,360
between the proof that shows why pi shows up and the central limit theorem,

68
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,960
which, as we talked about in the last video, is the thing that explains

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,000
when you can expect a normal distribution to arise in nature?

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,880
So with all of that as the goal, first things first,

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,120
let's dig into the classic and very beautiful proof.

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,800
All right, when you want to find the area underneath a curve,

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,040
the tool for doing that is an integral.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
As a quick reminder for how you might read this notation,

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,800
you might imagine approximating that area with many different rectangles

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,920
under the curve, where the height of each such rectangle

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
is the value of the function above that point, in this case,

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
e to the negative x squared for a certain input x,

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,760
and the width is some little number that we're calling dx.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
We need to add up the areas of all these rectangles,

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,640
for values of x ranging from negative infinity up to infinity,

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,520
and the use of that notation dx is kind of meant to imply

83
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
you shouldn't think of any specific width, but instead you ask,

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,360
as the chosen width for your rectangles gets thinner and thinner,

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,240
what does this sum of all those areas approach?

86
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,320
Of course, all of that is just notation unless you provide a way to answer that question,

87
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,720
and the magic of calculus is that it provides just that,

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
at least usually.

89
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,160
You see, usually the procedure here would be to find some function

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,200
whose derivative is equal to the stuff we have on the inside,

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,880
e to the negative x squared.

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,760
In other words, we want to find an antiderivative of that function.

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,640
The problem is, for this particular function,

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,000
it is provably not possible to find such an antiderivative.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,680
It's a little weird and beyond the scope of what I want to talk about here,

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,480
but basically, even though there exists an antiderivative,

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,320
it is a well-defined function,

98
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,320
you cannot express what that antiderivative is using all our usual tools,

99
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,120
like polynomial expressions, trig functions, exponentials,

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
or any way to mix them together.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,440
So finding this area requires a bit of cleverness.

102
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,760
There needs to be a new trick that we bring to bear.

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,560
And the first step to this trick is easily the most absurd.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
We start by bumping things up one dimension,

105
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
so that instead of asking for the area under a bell curve,

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
we ask for the volume underneath this kind of bell surface.

107
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
You could rightly ask, why would you do that?

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Who ordered another dimension?

109
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
And I'll admit, it's not terribly motivated right now,

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
other than to say, watch what happens when we just try it.

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,200
And in general, with hard problems,

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,240
it's never a bad idea to try solving cousins of the problem,

113
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
since that can help you get a little bit of momentum and insight.

114
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
To be clear on how this higher dimensional function is defined,

115
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
it takes in two different inputs, x and y,

116
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
which we might think of as a point on the xy-plane.

117
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,120
And the way to think about it is to consider the distance from that point to the origin,

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,640
which I'll label as r,

119
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,080
and then to plug in that distance to our original bell curve function,

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
we take e to the negative r squared.

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,560
You might notice the lines I've drawn on this diagram make a right triangle.

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,080
So by the Pythagorean theorem, x squared plus y squared equals r squared.

123
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,920
So in the function I have written, where you see x squared plus y squared,

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
you can think in the back of your mind,

125
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
that's really the square of the distance from the point to the origin.

126
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
The main thing to notice here is how this gives our function a kind of circular symmetry,

127
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,960
in the sense that all of the inputs that sit on a given circle have the same output.

128
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
And so when we graph this function in three dimensions,

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
it means it has a rotational symmetry about the z-axis.

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
Math tends to reward you when you respect its symmetries,

131
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,320
so for our question of computing the volume underneath this surface,

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,560
what we're going to do is respect that symmetry,

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,360
and imagine integrating together a bunch of thin little cylinders underneath that surface.

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
Here, making this a little more quantitative,

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,360
let's focus on just one of those cylindrical shells,

136
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
where its area is going to be the circumference of that shell times the height.

137
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,480
You might imagine it as something like the label on a soup can that we can unwrap into a rectangle.

138
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,080
The circumference of the cylinder, which is the top side of that rectangle,

139
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,240
is going to be 2 pi times the radius.

140
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
And then the height of our cylinder, the other side of our rectangle,

141
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,320
is the height of the surface at this point,

142
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,800
which by definition is the value of our function associated with that radius,

143
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
which like I said earlier you can think of as e to the negative r squared.

144
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
The real way you want to think about this is to give that cylinder a little bit of thickness,

145
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,680
which we'll call dr, so that the volume that it represents is approximately

146
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,880
that area we just looked at multiplied by this thickness dr.

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Our task now is to integrate together, or add together,

148
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,120
all of these different cylinders as r ranges between 0 and infinity.

149
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,200
Or more precisely, we consider what happens as that thickness gets thinner and thinner,

150
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,880
approaching 0, and we add together the volumes of the many many many different

151
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,960
thin cylinders that sit underneath that curve.

152
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,600
You might think this is just a harder version of what we were looking at earlier,

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
three dimensions should be more complicated than two.

154
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
But actually, something very helpful has happened.

155
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,000
First let me clean up a little by factoring the pi outside that integral.

156
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,040
Now the stuff inside that integral, having picked up this term 2r,

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
does have an antiderivative.

158
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
We can now apply the usual tactics of calculus.

159
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Specifically, that whole inside expression is the derivative of negative e to the negative r squared.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,280
And so, those of you comfortable with calculus know what to do from here.

161
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,160
We take that antiderivative and plug in the upper bound, which is negative infinity squared,

162
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,440
and that gives us 0, or speaking a little bit more precisely,

163
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,800
if you consider the limit of this expression as the input approaches infinity, the limiting value is 0,

164
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
and we subtract off the value of that antiderivative at the lower bound, 0,

165
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
which in this case is negative 1.

166
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,840
So all in all, the whole integral just works out to be 1,

167
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,880
which means all we're left with is that factor out in front, pi.

168
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,880
Evidently, the volume underneath this bell surface is pi.

169
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,280
And I'll point out in this case, it's not wild that pi shows up,

170
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,000
because the surface has this intrinsic circular symmetry.

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,880
Still, you might wonder, how does that help us?

172
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
As I said, throughout math, if you face a hard problem,

173
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,080
solving an adjacent problem can be unexpectedly helpful as a next step.

174
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,960
And in this case, it's helpful not just for building intuition,

175
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,040
but we can directly relate the three-dimensional graph to our two-dimensional graph

176
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
by analyzing the volume in a second, different way.

177
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
You see, the more general way to approach volumes underneath surfaces

178
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
is to think of chopping it up into slices that are all parallel to one of the axes.

179
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,160
For example, all these slices that are parallel to the x-axis.

180
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,640
For example, this right here is a slice that corresponds to the plane y equals 0.

181
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
You might notice it looks just like a bell curve,

182
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,000
and if we write out the function, this should actually make a lot of sense.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,160
You could just plug in y equals 0, but to help see what happens with other slices,

184
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,320
notice how, thanks to the rules of exponentiation,

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,120
we could also write our function as e to the negative x squared times e to the negative y squared.

186
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,400
It factors out nicely.

187
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,160
On this slice, that e to the negative y squared is just a number, specifically the number 1.

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
So this is the same graph we've seen before, e to the negative x squared,

189
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
meaning that the area of this slice is exactly the thing that we're looking for.

190
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
It's the mystery constant, which I'm going to give the name c.

191
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,520
What's nice is there's nothing really special about this particular slice.

192
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,040
If we chose a different slice corresponding to a different y value,

193
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
it corresponds to multiplying this curve by a different number.

194
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
So it's the same basic shape, just scaled down by that number,

195
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,960
meaning its area is the same as our mystery constant, just scaled down by some number.

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,840
That's pretty cool.

197
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Each one of these slices has the same basic shape, just rescaled in the vertical direction,

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,480
which, by the way, is not at all true for most two-variable functions.

199
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,640
This is very much dependent on the fact that we were able to factor our function

200
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,040
into one part that's just dependent on the y and another part that's just dependent on the x.

201
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,200
Now, to think about the volume underneath this whole surface,

202
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,800
here's another way we could phrase it.

203
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,000
We're going to compute another integral that ranges from y equals negative infinity up to infinity,

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,080
where the term inside that integral tells us the area of each one of those slices.

205
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,440
And when we multiply it by a little thickness dy,

206
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
you might think of it as giving each one of those slices a little bit of volume.

207
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,600
And remember, that term c sitting in front represents the thing we want to know,

208
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,840
which itself is an integral, a suspiciously similar-looking integral.

209
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
See, if we take the expression on the top and we factor out that constant c,

210
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
because it's just a number, it doesn't depend on y,

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,160
the thing we're left with, the integral we need to compute,

212
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
is exactly the mystery constant, the thing we don't know.

213
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,360
So overall, the volume underneath this bell surface works out to be this mystery constant squared.

214
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,720
Out of context, this might seem very unhelpful,

215
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
it's just relating one thing we don't know to another thing we don't know,

216
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,240
except we've already computed the volume under this surface, we know that it's equal to pi.

217
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,200
Therefore, the mystery constant we want to know, the area underneath this bell curve,

218
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
must be the square root of pi.

219
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,160
It's a very pretty argument, but a few things are not entirely satisfying.

220
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,120
For one thing, it feels a little bit like a trick, something that just happened to work,

221
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,720
without offering much of a sense for how you could have rediscovered it yourself.

222
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,480
Also, if we think back to our imagined statistician's friend,

223
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
it doesn't really answer their question,

224
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,840
which was what do circles have to do with population statistics?

225
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
Like I said, it's the first step, not the last,

226
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,600
and as our next step, let's see if we can unpack why this proof is not quite as wild and arbitrary

227
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
as you might first think, and how it relates to an explanation for where this function

228
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,480
e to the negative x squared is coming from in the first place.

229
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,120
John Herschel was this mathematician slash scientist slash inventor who really did all

230
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,600
sorts of things throughout the 19th century. He made contributions in chemistry, astronomy,

231
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,440
photography, botany, he invented the blueprint and named many of the moons in our solar system,

232
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
and in the midst of all of this, he also offered a very elegant little derivation

233
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
for the Gaussian distribution in 1850.

234
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,720
The setup is to imagine that you want to describe some kind of probability distribution

235
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,880
in two-dimensional space. For instance, maybe you want to model the probability density

236
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,920
for hits on a dartboard. What Herschel showed is that if you want this distribution to satisfy

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
two pretty reasonable seeming properties, your hand is unexpectedly forced, and even if you

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
had never heard of a Gaussian in your life, you would be inexorably drawn to use a function with

239
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,640
the shape e to the negative x squared plus y squared. You do have one degree of freedom to

240
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,640
control the spread of that distribution, and of course there's going to be some constant sitting

241
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,280
in front to make sure it's normalized, but the point is that we're forced into this very specific

242
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,200
kind of bell curve shape. The first of these two properties is that the probability density around

243
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,520
each point depends only on its distance from the origin, not on its direction. So on a dartboard

244
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,680
with everybody aiming for the bullseye, this would mean that you could rotate the board and it would

245
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,400
make no difference for the distribution. Mathematically, this means that the function

246
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,240
describing your probability distribution, which I'll call f2 since it takes in two inputs x and y,

247
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,320
well it can be expressed as some single variable function of the radius r. And just to spell it

248
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,680
out, r is the distance between the point xy and the origin, the square root of x squared plus y squared.

249
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,160
Property number two is that the x and y coordinates of each point are independent from each other,

250
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,800
which is to say if you learn the x coordinate of a point, it would give you no information about the

251
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,960
y coordinate. The way this looks as an equation is that our function, which describes the probability

252
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,320
density around each point on the xy plane, can be factored into two different parts, one of which

253
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,480
can be purely written in terms of x, this is the distribution of the x coordinate, I'm giving it

254
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,600
the name g, and the other part is purely in terms of y, this would be the distribution for the y

255
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,560
coordinate, which I'm temporarily calling h. But if you combine this with the assumption that things

256
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,280
are radially symmetric, both of these should be the same distribution. The behavior on each axis

257
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,640
should look the same. So we could also write this as g of x times g of y, it's the same function.

258
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,560
And more than that, this function is actually going to be proportional to the one we were just

259
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,280
looking at, the one that describes our probability density as a function of the radius, the distance

260
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,840
away from the origin. To see this, imagine you were to analyze a point that was on the x axis,

261
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,960
a distance r away from the origin. Then the two distinct ways to express our function based on the

262
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,200
two different properties tells us that f of r has to equal some constant multiplied by g of r. So

263
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,280
these functions f and g are basically the same thing, just up to some constant multiple. And you

264
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,000
know what? It would be really nice if we could just assume that that constant was one, so that

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,800
f and g were literally the same function. And what I'm going to do, which might feel a little bit

266
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,000
cheeky, is just assume that that is the case. What this means is that our answer is going to be a

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
little bit wrong. The function that we will deduce describing this distribution will be off by some

268
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,440
constant factor. But that's no big deal, because in the end we can just rescale to make sure the

269
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,880
area under the curve is one, like we always do with probability distributions. Now, if f and g

270
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,680
are the same thing, this gives us a very nice little equation purely in terms of the function f.

271
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,360
Remember what this function f is. If you have some point in the xy plane, a distance r from the

272
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,400
origin, then f of r tells you the relative likelihood of that point showing up in the

273
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,600
random process. More specifically, it gives the probability density of that point. At the outset,

274
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,840
this function could have been anything. But Herschel's two different properties evidently

275
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,160
imply something kind of funny about it, which is that if we take the x and y coordinates of that

276
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,160
point on the plane and evaluate this function on them separately, taking f of x times f of y,

277
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,800
it should give us the same result. Or if you prefer, we could expand out the meaning of that

278
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,680
distance r as the square root of x squared plus y squared, and this is what our key equation looks

279
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,440
like. This kind of equation is what's known in the business as a functional equation. We're not

280
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,080
solving for an unknown number. Instead, we're saying that the equation is true for all possible

281
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,160
numbers x and y, and the thing we're trying to find is an unknown function.

282
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,720
In the back of your mind, you can think we already know one function that satisfies this property,

283
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,520
e to the negative x squared, and as a sanity check you might verify for yourself that it does

284
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,960
satisfy that. Of course, the point is to pretend that you don't know that, and to instead deduce

285
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,560
what all of the functions are which satisfy this property. In general, functional equations can be

286
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,280
quite tricky, but let me show you how you can solve this one. First, it's nice to introduce

287
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,920
a little helper function that I'll call h of x, which will be defined as our mystery function

288
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,920
evaluated at the square root of x. Said another way, h of x squared is the same thing as f of x.

289
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,720
For example, in the back of your mind where you know that e to the negative x squared will happen

290
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,920
to be one of the answers, this little helper function h would be e to the negative x. But

291
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,160
again, we're pretending like we don't know that. The reason for doing this is that the key property

292
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,920
looks a little bit nicer if we phrase it in terms of this helper function,

293
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,720
h. Because now what it's saying is if you take two arbitrary positive numbers and you add them

294
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,360
up and evaluate h, it's the same thing as evaluating h on them separately and then

295
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,640
multiplying the results. In a sense, it turns addition into multiplication. Some of you might

296
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,480
see where this is going, but let's take a moment to walk through why this forces our hand. As a

297
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
next step, you might want to pause and convince yourself that if this property is true for the

298
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,840
sum of two numbers, this property also must be true if we add up an arbitrary number of inputs.

299
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
To get a feel for why this is so constraining, think about plugging in a whole number,

300
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,560
something like h of 5. Because you can write 5 as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1,

301
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,280
this key property means that it must equal h of 1 multiplied by itself 5 times. Of course,

302
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,760
there's nothing special about 5. I could have chosen any whole number n, and we'd be forced

303
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,520
to conclude that the function looks like some number raised to the power n. And let's go ahead

304
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,680
and give that number a name, like b for the base of our exponential. As a little mini exercise here,

305
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,760
see if you can pause and take a moment to convince yourself that the same is true for a rational

306
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,520
input, that if you plug in p over q to this function, it must look like this base b raised

307
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,000
to the power p over q. And as a hint, you might want to think about adding that input to itself

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,840
q different times. And then because rational numbers are dense in the real number line,

309
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,480
if we make one more pretty reasonable assumption that we only care about continuous functions,

310
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,440
this is enough to force your hand completely and say that h has to be an exponential function,

311
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,040
b to the power x, for all real number inputs x. I guess to be more precise I should say for all

312
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,440
positive real inputs. The way we defined h, it's only taking in positive numbers.

313
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,040
Now, as we've gone over before, instead of writing down exponential functions as some base raised to

314
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,640
the power x, mathematicians often like to write them as e to the power of some constant c times x.

315
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
Making the choice to always use e as a base while letting that constant c determine which specific

316
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,880
exponential function you're talking about just makes everything much easier any time calculus

317
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,760
comes wandering along your path. And so this means that our target function f has to look like

318
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,360
e to the power of some constant times x squared. The beauty is that that function is no longer

319
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,320
something that was merely handed down to us from on high. Instead we started with these two different

320
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,280
premises for how we wanted a distribution in two dimensions to behave, and we were drawn to the

321
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,680
conclusion that the shape of the expression describing that distribution as a function

322
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,720
of the radius away from the origin has to be e to the power of some constant times that radius

323
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,840
squared. You'll remember I said earlier this answer will be off by a factor of a constant.

324
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,080
We need to rescale it to make it a valid probability distribution, and geometrically you

325
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,040
might think of that as scaling it so that the volume under the surface is equal to one. Now you

326
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,240
might notice that for positive values of this constant in the exponent c, our function blows up

327
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,360
to infinity in all directions, so the volume under that surface would be infinite, meaning it's not

328
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,640
possible to renormalize. You can't turn it into a probability distribution, and that leaves us with

329
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,960
the last constraint, which is that this constant in the exponent has to be a negative number,

330
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,560
and the specific value of that number determines the spread of the distribution.

331
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,560
Ten years after Herschel wrote this, James Clerk Maxwell, who's most well known for having written

332
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,960
down the fundamental equations for electricity and magnetism, independently stumbled across the

333
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,760
same derivation. In his case he was doing it in three dimensions, since he was doing statistical

334
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,200
mechanics and he was deriving a formula for the distribution for velocities of molecules in a gas.

335
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,440
But the logic all works out the same. For you and me, if we view this as the defining property of a

336
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
Gaussian, then it's a little bit less surprising that pi might make an appearance. After all,

337
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,440
circular symmetry was part of this defining property. More than that, it makes the clever

338
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,640
proof that we saw earlier feel a little bit less out of the blue. I mean, a key problem-solving

339
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,480
principle in math is to use the defining features of your setup. And if you had been primed by this

340
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,840
Herschel-Maxwell derivation, where the defining property for a Gaussian is this coincidence of

341
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,120
having a distribution that's both radially symmetric and also independent along each axis,

342
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,520
then the very first step of our proof, which seemed so strange bumping the problem up one

343
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,640
dimension, was really just a way of opening the door to let that defining property make itself

344
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,480
visible. And if you think back, the essence of the proof came down to using that radial symmetry on

345
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,680
the one hand, and then also using the ability to factor the function on the other. From this

346
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,880
standpoint, using both those facts feels less like a trick that happened to work, and more like

347
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,360
an inevitable necessity. Nevertheless, thinking once again of our statistician's friend,

348
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,520
this is still not entirely satisfying. Using the Herschel-Maxwell derivation, saying this property

349
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,080
of a multi-dimensional distribution is what defines a Gaussian, well that presumes that we're

350
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,200
already in some kind of multi-dimensional situation in the first place. Much more commonly,

351
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,720
the way that a normal distribution arises in practice doesn't feel spatial or geometric at all.

352
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,040
It stems from the central limit theorem, which is all about adding together many different

353
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,320
independent variables. So to bring it all home here, what we need to do is explain why the

354
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,120
function that's characterized by this Herschel-Maxwell derivation should be the same thing as

355
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,840
the function that sits at the heart of the central limit theorem. And at this point,

356
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,840
those of you following along are probably going to make fun of me, I think it makes sense to pull

357
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,680
this last step out as its own video. Oh, and one final footnote here. After making a Patreon post

358
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,040
about this particular project, one patron, who's a mathematician named Kevin Ega, shared something

359
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,520
completely delightful that I had never seen before, which is that if you apply this integration

360
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,800
trick in higher dimensions, it lets you derive the formulas for volumes of higher dimensional spheres.

361
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
A very fun exercise, I'm leaving the details up on the screen for any viewers who are comfortable

362
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,000
with integration by parts. Thank you very much to Kevin for sharing that one, and thanks to all

363
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
patrons, by the way, both for the support of the channel and also for all the feedback you offer

364
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,240
on the early drafts of videos.
