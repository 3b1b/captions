1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,081
You may have heard the phrase, the unreasonable 

2
00:00:02,081 --> 00:00:04,380
effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,072
This was the title of a paper by the physicist Eugene Wigner, 

4
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:11,500
but even more fun than the title is the way that he chooses to open it.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,823
The paper begins, quote, There is a story about two friends 

6
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:18,060
who were classmates in high school, talking about their jobs.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,660
One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,156
They showed a reprint to their former classmate, 

9
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:26,980
and the reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,759
And the statistician explained to the former classmate the meaning of 

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,700
the symbols for the actual population, the average population, and so on.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,534
The classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite 

13
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,840
sure whether the statistician was pulling their leg.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,120
How can you know that?

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,760
was the query.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,760
And what is this symbol over here?

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,820
Oh, said the statistician, this is pi.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,900
What is that?

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,080
The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,420
Well, now you're pushing the joke too far, said the classmate.

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,960
Surely the population has nothing to do with the circumference of a circle.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,300
In the paper, Wigner then goes on to talk about the more general 

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,413
phenomenon of concepts and pure math, seeming to find applications 

24
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:08,480
that extend strangely beyond what their definitions would suggest.

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,826
But I would like to stay focused on this particular anecdote 

26
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,760
and the question that the statistician's friend is getting at.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,969
You see, there is a very beautiful and classic proof that 

28
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,840
explains the pi inside the formula for a normal distribution.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,674
And despite there being a number of other really great explanations online, 

30
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:28,710
see some links in the description, I cannot help but indulge in the pleasure of 

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,720
reanimating it here.

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,933
For one thing, there is a fun side note that I didn't learn until recently about 

33
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:37,360
how you can use this proof to derive the volumes of higher dimensional spheres.

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,687
But much more importantly than that, what I really 

35
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:43,000
want to do is try to go beyond the classic proof.

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,060
Consider this hypothetical statistician's friend.

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,700
What I want to ask is, can we find an explanation that would satisfy their disbelief?

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,501
You see, they're not just asking for some pure math proof 

39
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,980
about a function that was handed down to them on high.

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,112
The friend's incredulity was that circles should 

41
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:01,580
have anything to do with population statistics.

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,180
Until we fully draw that connecting line, we should consider the task incomplete.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,285
Those of you who watched the last video on the central limit theorem will 

44
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:13,482
have some of the backdrop here, because there we broke down the formula 

45
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:16,680
for a normal distribution, which is also called a Gaussian distribution.

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,996
And when you strip away all of the different parameters and the constants, 

47
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:25,280
the basic function that describes the bell curve shape is e to the negative x squared.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,519
And the reason that pi showed up in the final formula was that the area underneath 

49
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,340
this curve works out, as you will see in a couple minutes, to be the square root of pi.

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,735
So what that meant for us was that at some point we needed to divide out by 

51
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:43,041
that square root of pi to make sure that the area under the curve is one, 

52
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,660
which is a requirement before you can interpret it as a probability distribution.

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,623
In the full formula that you would see, say, in a stats book, 

54
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:53,843
this gets mixed together with some of the other constants, 

55
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:58,100
but in its purest form that pi originates from the area underneath this curve.

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,426
So step number one for you and me is to explain that area, 

57
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:05,060
but I want to emphasize it's not the last step.

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,215
To satisfy the question raised by that hypothetical statistician's friend, 

59
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:10,340
we need to go further.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,173
We need to also answer why is it that this function e to 

61
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,860
the negative x squared is so special in the first place?

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,955
I mean, there are lots of different formulas you could write down that would give 

63
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:24,100
a shape that, you know, vaguely bulges in the middle and tapers out on either side.

64
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,860
So why is it that this specific function holds such a special place in statistics?

65
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,363
To phrase our goal another way, can we find a connection between the proof that shows 

66
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:37,266
why pi shows up and the central limit theorem, which, 

67
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:41,943
as we talked about in the last video, is the thing that explains when you can expect a 

68
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:44,040
normal distribution to arise in nature.

69
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,011
So with all of that as the goal, first things first, 

70
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:49,280
let's dig into the classic and very beautiful proof.

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,829
All right, when you want to find the area underneath a curve, 

72
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,760
the tool for doing that is an integral.

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,939
As a quick reminder for how you might read this notation, 

74
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,097
you might imagine approximating that area with many different rectangles under the curve, 

75
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:08,117
where the height of each such rectangle is the value of the function above that point, 

76
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:11,120
in this case, e to the negative x squared for a certain input x, 

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,800
and the width is some little number that we're calling dx.

78
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,050
We need to add up the areas of all these rectangles, 

79
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,177
for values of x ranging from negative infinity up to infinity, 

80
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,395
and the use of that notation dx is kind of meant to imply you shouldn't think of any 

81
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:28,862
specific width, but instead you ask, as the chosen width for your rectangles gets thinner 

82
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,840
and thinner, what does this sum of all those areas approach?

83
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,770
Of course, all of that is just notation unless you provide a way to answer that question, 

84
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,380
and the magic of calculus is that it provides just that, at least usually.

85
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,440
You see, usually the procedure here would be to find some function whose 

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,560
derivative is equal to the stuff we have on the inside, e to the negative x squared.

87
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,880
In other words, we want to find an antiderivative of that function.

88
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,293
The problem is, for this particular function, it is 

89
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,080
provably not possible to find such an antiderivative.

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,395
It's a little weird and beyond the scope of what I want to talk about here, 

91
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:06,724
but basically, even though there exists an antiderivative, it is a well-defined function, 

92
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:10,283
you cannot express what that antiderivative is using all our usual tools, 

93
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:13,120
like polynomial expressions, trig functions, exponentials, 

94
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,660
or any way to mix them together.

95
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,520
So finding this area requires a bit of cleverness.

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,460
There needs to be a new trick that we bring to bear.

97
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,380
And the first step to this trick is easily the most absurd.

98
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,845
We start by bumping things up one dimension, so that instead of asking for the 

99
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:31,360
area under a bell curve, we ask for the volume underneath this kind of bell surface.

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,340
You could rightly ask, why would you do that?

101
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,580
Who ordered another dimension?

102
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,899
And I'll admit, it's not terribly motivated right now, 

103
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,620
other than to say, watch what happens when we just try it.

104
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,213
In general, with hard problems, it's never a bad idea to try solving cousins of 

105
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:48,640
the problem, since that can help you get a little bit of momentum and insight.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,622
To be clear on how this higher dimensional function is defined, 

107
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:56,354
it takes in two different inputs, x and y, which we might think of as a point 

108
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:57,120
on the xy-plane.

109
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,738
And the way to think about it is to consider the distance from that point to the origin, 

110
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:05,487
which I'll label as r, and then to plug in that distance to our original bell 

111
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:08,420
curve function, that is, we take e to the negative r squared.

112
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,180
You might notice the lines I've drawn on this diagram make a right triangle.

113
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,140
So, by the Pythagorean theorem, x squared plus y squared equals r squared.

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,905
So in the function I have written, where you see x squared plus y squared, 

115
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:22,306
you can think in the back of your mind, that's really the 

116
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,460
square of the distance from the point to the origin.

117
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,137
The main thing to notice here is how this gives our function a kind of circular symmetry, 

118
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:32,980
in the sense that all of the inputs that sit on a given circle have the same output.

119
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,575
And so when we graph this function in three dimensions, 

120
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:39,380
it means it has a rotational symmetry about the z-axis.

121
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,325
Math tends to reward you when you respect its symmetries, 

122
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:46,661
so for our question of computing the volume underneath the surface, 

123
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:49,064
what we're going to do is respect that symmetry, 

124
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:53,480
and imagine integrating together a bunch of thin little cylinders underneath that surface.

125
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,250
Here, making this a little more quantitative, let's focus on just one of those 

126
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,561
cylindrical shells, where its area is going to be the circumference of that shell times 

127
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:03,100
the height.

128
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,776
You might imagine it as something like the label 

129
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,100
on a soup can that we can unwrap into a rectangle.

130
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,478
The circumference of the cylinder, which is the top side of that rectangle, 

131
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,260
is going to be 2 pi times the radius.

132
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,633
And then the height of our cylinder, the other side of our rectangle, 

133
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:22,802
is the height of the surface at this point, which by definition is the value of our 

134
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:27,218
function associated with that radius, which like I said earlier you can think of as e to 

135
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,360
the negative r squared.

136
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,157
Now the real way you want to think about this is to give that cylinder 

137
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:36,989
a little bit of thickness, dr, so that the volume that it represents is 

138
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,980
approximately that area we just looked at, multiplied by this thickness dr.

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,860
Our task now is to integrate together, or add together, 

140
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,820
all of these different cylinders as r ranges between 0 and infinity.

141
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,380
Or more precisely, we consider what happens as that thickness gets thinner and thinner, 

142
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,548
approaching 0, and we add together the volumes of the many many many 

143
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:59,120
different thin cylinders that sit underneath that curve.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,386
You might think this is just a harder version of what we were looking at earlier, 

145
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,860
three dimensions should be more complicated than two.

146
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,480
But actually something very helpful has happened.

147
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,000
First let me clean up a little by factoring the pi outside that integral.

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,777
Now the stuff inside that integral, having picked up this term 2r, 

149
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,540
does have an antiderivative.

150
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,980
We can now apply the usual tactics of calculus.

151
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,461
Specifically, that whole inside expression is the 

152
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:29,340
derivative of negative e to the negative r squared.

153
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,140
And so, those of you comfortable with calculus know what to do from here.

154
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,341
We take that antiderivative and plug in the upper bound, 

155
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:39,303
which is negative infinity squared, and that gives us 0, 

156
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:43,199
or speaking a little bit more precisely, if you consider the limit of this 

157
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:46,836
expression as the input approaches infinity, the limiting value is 0, 

158
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:50,629
and we subtract off the value of that antiderivative at the lower bound, 

159
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,500
0, which in this case is negative 1.

160
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,841
So all in all, the whole integral just works out to be 1, 

161
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:59,000
which means all we're left with is that factor out in front, pi.

162
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,940
Evidently, the volume underneath this bell surface is pi.

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,308
And I'll point out in this case, it's not wild that pi shows up, 

164
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:10,000
because the surface has this intrinsic circular symmetry.

165
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,060
Still, you might wonder, how does that help us?

166
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,302
As I said, throughout math, if you face a hard problem, 

167
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:19,780
solving an adjacent problem can be unexpectedly helpful as a next step.

168
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,041
And in this case, it's helpful not just for building intuition, 

169
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,200
but we can directly relate the three-dimensional graph to our 

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,920
two-dimensional graph by analyzing the volume in a second, different way.

171
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,115
You see, the more general way to approach volumes underneath surfaces is to 

172
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,880
think of chopping it up into slices that are all parallel to one of the axes.

173
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,220
For example, all these slices that are parallel to the x-axis.

174
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,340
For example, this right here is a slice that corresponds to the plane y equals 0.

175
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,508
You might notice it looks just like a bell curve, 

176
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,760
and if we write out the function, this should actually make a lot of sense.

177
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,951
You could just plug in y equals 0, but to help see what happens with other slices, 

178
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:00,391
notice how, thanks to the rules of exponentiation, 

179
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,979
we could also write our function as e to the negative x squared times e to 

180
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,080
the negative y squared.

181
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,480
It factors out nicely.

182
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,866
On this slice, that e to the negative y squared is just a number, 

183
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,280
specifically the number 1.

184
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,318
So this is the same graph we've seen before, e to the negative x squared, 

185
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:20,080
meaning that the area of this slice is exactly the thing that we're looking for.

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,220
It's the mystery constant, which I'm going to give the name c.

187
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,100
What's nice is there's nothing really special about this particular slice.

188
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,982
If we chose a different slice corresponding to a different y value, 

189
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:34,080
it corresponds to multiplying this curve by a different number.

190
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,911
So it's the same basic shape, just scaled down by that number, 

191
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:42,540
meaning its area is the same as our mystery constant, just scaled down by some number.

192
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,720
That's pretty cool.

193
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,586
Each one of these slices has the same basic shape, 

194
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:49,653
just rescaled in the vertical direction, which, by the way, 

195
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:52,260
is not at all true for most two-variable functions.

196
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,911
This is very much dependent on the fact that we were able to factor our function into 

197
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:01,200
one part that's just dependent on the y and another part that's just dependent on the x.

198
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,966
Now, to think about the volume underneath this whole surface, 

199
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,760
here's another way we could phrase it.

200
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,935
We're going to compute another integral that ranges from y 

201
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,113
equals negative infinity up to infinity, where the term inside 

202
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:16,140
that integral tells us the area of each one of those slices.

203
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,056
And when we multiply it by a little thickness dy, 

204
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:22,700
you might think of it as giving each one of those slices a little bit of volume.

205
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,856
And remember, that term c sitting in front represents the thing we want to know, 

206
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:31,840
which itself is an integral, a suspiciously similar-looking integral.

207
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,417
See, if we take the expression on the top and we factor out that constant c, 

208
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:40,354
because it's just a number, it doesn't depend on y, the thing we're left with, 

209
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:44,840
the integral we need to compute, is exactly the mystery constant, the thing we don't know.

210
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,582
So overall, the volume underneath this bell surface 

211
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,380
works out to be this mystery constant squared.

212
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,667
Out of context, this might seem very unhelpful, 

213
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,115
it's just relating one thing we don't know to another thing we don't know, 

214
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:00,920
except we've already computed the volume under this surface, 

215
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,300
we know that it's equal to pi.

216
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,493
Therefore, the mystery constant we want to know, 

217
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:08,820
the area underneath this bell curve, must be the square root of pi.

218
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,160
It's a very pretty argument, but a few things are not entirely satisfying.

219
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,256
For one thing, it feels a little bit like a trick, 

220
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:21,108
something that just happened to work without offering much of a sense for how you 

221
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,800
could have rediscovered it yourself.

222
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,531
Also, if we think back to our imagined statistician's friend, 

223
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:30,696
it doesn't really answer their question, which was what do circles have to do with 

224
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,800
population statistics?

225
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,864
Like I said, it's the first step, not the last, and as our next step, 

226
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:39,522
let's see if we can unpack why this proof is not quite as wild and arbitrary 

227
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:42,990
as you might first think, and how it relates to an explanation for where 

228
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,600
this function e to the negative x squared is coming from in the first place.

229
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,501
John Herschel was this mathematician slash scientist slash inventor 

230
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:59,060
who really did all sorts of things throughout the 19th century.

231
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,086
He made contributions in chemistry, astronomy, photography, botany, 

232
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:07,153
he invented the blueprint and named many of the moons in our solar system, 

233
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,816
and in the midst of all of this, he also offered a very elegant little derivation for 

234
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,660
the Gaussian distribution in 1850.

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,472
The setup is to imagine that you want to describe some 

236
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:20,080
kind of probability distribution in two-dimensional space.

237
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,500
For instance, maybe you want to model the probability density for hits on a dartboard.

238
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,084
What Herschel showed is that if you want this distribution to satisfy two pretty 

239
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,313
reasonable seeming properties, your hand is unexpectedly forced, 

240
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,293
and even if you had never heard of a Gaussian in your life, 

241
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:39,318
you would be inexorably drawn to use a function with the shape e to the negative 

242
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,560
x squared plus y squared.

243
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,624
You do have one degree of freedom to control the spread of that distribution, 

244
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,331
and of course there's going to be some constant sitting in front to make sure it's 

245
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:52,083
normalized, but the point is that we're forced into this very specific kind of bell 

246
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:52,620
curve shape.

247
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,666
The first of these two properties is that the probability density around 

248
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:02,140
each point depends only on its distance from the origin, not on its direction.

249
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,229
So on a dartboard with everybody aiming for the bullseye, 

250
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:08,580
this would mean that you could rotate the board and it would make no difference 

251
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,460
for the distribution.

252
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,469
Mathematically, this means that the function describing your probability distribution, 

253
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:20,580
which I'll call f2 since it takes in two inputs x and y, 

254
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,620
well it can be expressed as some single variable function of the radius r.

255
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,517
And just to spell it out, r is the distance between the point xy and the origin, 

256
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,820
the square root of x squared plus y squared.

257
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,557
Property number two is that the x and y coordinates of each point are 

258
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:40,854
independent from each other, which is to say if you learn the x coordinate of a point, 

259
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:43,620
it would give you no information about the y coordinate.

260
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,860
The way this looks as an equation is that our function, 

261
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,557
which describes the probability density around each point on the xy plane, 

262
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,796
can be factored into two different parts, one of which can be purely written in terms 

263
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:59,641
of x, this is the distribution of the x coordinate, I'm giving it the name g, 

264
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:03,732
and the other part is purely in terms of y, this would be the distribution for the 

265
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:06,000
y coordinate, which I'm temporarily calling h.

266
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,998
But if you combine this with the assumption that things are radially symmetric, 

267
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,089
both of these should be the same distribution, 

268
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,180
the behavior on each axis should look the same.

269
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,360
So we could also write this as g of x times g of y, it's the same function.

270
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,994
And more than that, this function is actually going to be proportional 

271
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:25,105
to the one we were looking at, the one that describes our probability 

272
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,260
density as a function of the radius, the distance away from the origin.

273
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,178
To see this, imagine you were to analyze a point that was on the x-axis, 

274
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,780
a distance r away from the origin.

275
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,585
Then the two distinct ways to express our function based on the two different 

276
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:42,980
properties tells us that f of r has to equal some constant multiplied by g of r.

277
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,863
So these functions f and g are basically the same thing, 

278
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,500
just up to some constant multiple.

279
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,840
And you know what?

280
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,633
It would be really nice if we could just assume that that constant was one, 

281
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:56,080
so that f and g were literally the same function.

282
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,804
And what I'm going to do, which might feel a little bit cheeky, 

283
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:01,600
is just assume that that is the case.

284
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,660
What this means is that our answer is going to be a little bit wrong.

285
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,130
The function that we will deduce describing this 

286
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,380
distribution will be off by some constant factor.

287
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,445
But that's no big deal, because in the end we can just rescale to make sure the 

288
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:16,960
area under the curve is one, like we always do with probability distributions.

289
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,736
Now, if f and g are the same thing, this gives us a very 

290
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,840
nice little equation purely in terms of the function f.

291
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,200
Remember what this function f is.

292
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,261
If you have some point in the xy-plane, a distance r from the origin, 

293
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:34,453
then f of r tells you the relative likelihood of that point showing up in the 

294
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,260
random process.

295
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
More specifically, it gives the probability density of that point.

296
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,936
At the outset, this function could have been anything, 

297
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:46,480
but Herschel's two different properties evidently imply something kind of funny about it, 

298
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,519
which is that if we take the x and y coordinates of that point on the plane and 

299
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,103
evaluate this function on them separately, taking f of x times f of y, 

300
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:55,820
it should give us the same result.

301
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,317
Or if you prefer, we could expand out the meaning of that distance r as the square 

302
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:04,180
root of x squared plus y squared, and this is what our key equation looks like.

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,880
This kind of equation is what's known in the business as a functional equation.

304
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,040
We're not solving for an unknown number.

305
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,268
Instead, we're saying that the equation is true for all possible numbers x and y, 

306
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,260
and the thing we're trying to find is an unknown function.

307
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,780
In the back of your mind, you can think we already know one function 

308
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,601
that satisfies this property, e to the negative x squared, 

309
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:30,380
and as a sanity check, you might verify for yourself that it does satisfy that.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,941
Of course, the point is to pretend that you don't know that, 

311
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:37,800
and to instead deduce what all of the functions are which satisfy this property.

312
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,093
In general, functional equations can be quite tricky, 

313
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,420
but let me show you how you can solve this one.

314
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,970
First, it's nice to introduce a little helper function that I'll call h of x, 

315
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,960
which will be defined as our mystery function evaluated at the square root of x.

316
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,020
Said another way, h of x squared is the same thing as f of x.

317
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,539
For example, in the back of your mind where you know that e 

318
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:02,567
to the negative x squared will happen to be one of the answers, 

319
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,360
this little helper function h would be e to the negative x.

320
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
But again, we're pretending like we don't know that.

321
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,183
The reason for doing this is that the key property for f looks a little bit nicer 

322
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,747
if we phrase it in terms of this helper function h, 

323
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:18,840
because now what it's saying is if you take two arbitrary positive numbers and you 

324
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,932
add them up and evaluate h, it's the same thing as evaluating h on them separately 

325
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:24,560
and then multiplying the results.

326
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,380
In a sense, it turns addition into multiplication.

327
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,454
Some of you might see where this is going, but let's 

328
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,940
take a moment to walk through why this forces our hand.

329
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,698
As a next step, you might want to pause and convince yourself that 

330
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,672
if this property is true for the sum of two numbers, 

331
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:43,880
this property also must be true if we add up an arbitrary number of inputs.

332
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,550
To get a feel for why this is so constraining, 

333
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,520
think about plugging in a whole number, something like h of 5.

334
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,978
Because you can write 5 as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1, 

335
00:18:54,978 --> 00:19:00,180
this key property means that it must equal h of 1 multiplied by itself five times.

336
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Of course, there's nothing special about 5.

337
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,451
I could have chosen any whole number n, and we'd be forced to conclude 

338
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:09,620
that the function looks like some number raised to the power n.

339
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,840
And let's go ahead and give that number a name, like b for the base of our exponential.

340
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,531
As a little mini exercise here, see if you can pause and take a moment to convince 

341
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:23,374
yourself that the same is true for a rational input, 

342
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:25,895
that if you plug in p over q to this function, 

343
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:29,060
it must look like this base b raised to the power p over q.

344
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,177
And as a hint, you might want to think about adding 

345
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,200
that input to itself q different times.

346
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,218
And then because rational numbers are dense in the real number line, 

347
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:46,026
if we make one more pretty reasonable assumption that we only care about 

348
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:49,938
continuous functions, this is enough to force your hand completely and say 

349
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:54,580
that h has to be an exponential function, b to the power x, for all real number inputs x.

350
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I guess to be more precise I should say for all positive real inputs.

351
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,520
The way we defined h, it's only taking in positive numbers.

352
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,012
Now, as we've gone over before, instead of writing down exponential 

353
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:09,473
functions as some base raised to the power x, mathematicians often 

354
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:12,780
like to write them as e to the power of some constant c times x.

355
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,956
Making the choice to always use e as a base while letting that constant c 

356
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:20,553
determine which specific exponential function you're talking about just 

357
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,500
makes everything much easier any time calculus comes wandering along your path.

358
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,184
And so this means that our target function f has to look 

359
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:32,480
like e to the power of some constant times x squared.

360
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,618
The beauty is that that function is no longer 

361
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:38,120
something that was merely handed down to us from on high.

362
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,033
Instead we started with these two different premises for how we wanted a distribution 

363
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,158
in two dimensions to behave, and we were drawn to the conclusion that the shape of 

364
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:51,233
the expression describing that distribution as a function of the radius away from 

365
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:55,160
the origin has to be e to the power of some constant times that radius squared.

366
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,680
You'll remember I said earlier this answer will be off by a factor of a constant.

367
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,054
We need to rescale it to make it a valid probability distribution, 

368
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,801
and geometrically you might think of that as scaling it so that the volume under the 

369
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:07,860
surface is equal to one.

370
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,176
Now you might notice that for positive values of this constant in the exponent c, 

371
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:15,915
our function blows up to infinity in all directions, 

372
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:18,601
so the volume under that surface would be infinite, 

373
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,720
meaning it's not possible to renormalize.

374
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,040
You can't turn it into a probability distribution.

375
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,509
And that leaves us with the last constraint, which is that this 

376
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:28,947
constant in the exponent has to be a negative number, 

377
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:32,560
and the specific value of that number determines the spread of the distribution.

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,726
Ten years after Herschel wrote this, James Clerk Maxwell, 

379
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:40,111
who's most well known for having written down the fundamental equations 

380
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:43,920
for electricity and magnetism, independently stumbled across the same derivation.

381
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,610
In his case he was doing it in three dimensions since he was doing 

382
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,304
statistical mechanics and he was deriving a formula for the distribution 

383
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:55,100
for velocities of molecules in a gas, but the logic all works out the same.

384
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,640
For you and me, if we view this as the defining property of a Gaussian, 

385
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,400
then it's a little bit less surprising that pi might make an appearance.

386
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,480
After all, circular symmetry was part of this defining property.

387
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,447
More than that, it makes the clever proof that we 

388
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:12,740
saw earlier feel a little bit less out of the blue.

389
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,762
I mean, a key problem-solving principle in math is to use the defining features of 

390
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:21,940
your setup, and if you had been primed by this Herschel-Maxwell derivation, 

391
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,777
where the defining property for a Gaussian is this coincidence of having a distribution 

392
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:30,570
that's both radially symmetric and also independent along each axis, 

393
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,133
then the very first step of our proof, which seemed so strange bumping the problem 

394
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:39,585
up one dimension, was really just a way of opening the door to let that defining 

395
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:41,180
property make itself visible.

396
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,414
And if you think back, the essence of the proof came down to using that radial symmetry 

397
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:50,640
on the one hand, and then also using the ability to factor the function on the other.

398
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,673
From this standpoint, using both those facts feels less like a 

399
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,240
trick that happened to work, and more like an inevitable necessity.

400
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,858
Nevertheless, thinking once again of our statistician's friend, 

401
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,960
this is still not entirely satisfying.

402
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,784
Using the Herschel-Maxwell derivation, saying this property of a 

403
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:12,874
multi-dimensional distribution is what defines a Gaussian, 

404
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:16,644
presumes that we're already in some kind of multi-dimensional situation 

405
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:17,640
in the first place.

406
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,238
Much more commonly, the way that a normal distribution 

407
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:24,640
arises in practice doesn't feel spatial or geometric at all.

408
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,470
It stems from the central limit theorem, which is all 

409
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,300
about adding together many different independent variables.

410
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,537
So to bring it all home here, what we need to do is explain why the function 

411
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:38,207
that's characterized by this Herschel-Maxwell derivation should be the same 

412
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:41,780
thing as the function that sits at the heart of the central limit theorem.

413
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,544
And at this point, those of you following along are probably going to make fun of me, 

414
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:49,680
I think it makes sense to pull this last step out as its own video.

415
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,180
Oh, and one final footnote here.

416
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,962
After making a Patreon post about this particular project, one patron, 

417
00:23:55,962 --> 00:24:00,151
who's a mathematician named Kevin Ega, shared something completely delightful that 

418
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:04,087
I had never seen before, which is that if you apply this integration trick in 

419
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:08,376
higher dimensions, it lets you derive the formulas for volumes of higher dimensional 

420
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:08,780
spheres.

421
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,126
It's a very fun exercise, I'm leaving the details up on the screen 

422
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:14,780
for any viewers who are comfortable with integration by parts.

423
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,482
Thank you very much to Kevin for sharing that one, and thanks to all patrons, 

424
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:20,507
by the way, both for the support of the channel, 

425
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:23,400
and also for all the feedback you offer on the early drafts of videos.

426
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:45,100
Thank you.
