1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
You may have heard the phrase,

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,380
the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,680
This was the title of a paper by the physicist Eugene Wigner,

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,500
but even more fun than the title is the way that he chooses to open it.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,980
The paper begins, quote,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,620
There is a story about two friends who were classmates in high school,

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,060
talking about their jobs.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,660
One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,960
They showed a reprint to their former classmate,

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,980
and the reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,760
And the statistician explained to the former classmate

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,700
the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, the average population, and so on.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,840
The classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure whether the statistician was pulling their leg.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,760
How can you know that? was the query.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,760
And what is this symbol over here?

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,820
Oh, said the statistician, this is pi.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,900
What is that?

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,080
The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,420
Well, now you're pushing the joke too far, said the classmate.

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,960
Surely the population has nothing to do with the circumference of a circle.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,800
In the paper, Wigner then goes on to talk about the more general phenomenon of concepts and pure math,

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,480
seeming to find applications that extend strangely beyond what their definitions would suggest.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,760
But I would like to stay focused on this particular anecdote

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,760
and the question that the statistician's friend is getting at.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,580
You see, there is a very beautiful and classic proof that explains the pi

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,840
inside the formula for a normal distribution.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,640
And despite there being a number of other really great explanations online,

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
see some links in the description,

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,720
I cannot help but indulge in the pleasure of reanimating it here.

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,360
For one thing, there is a fun side note that I didn't learn until recently

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
about how you can use this proof to derive the volumes of higher dimensional spheres.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,000
But much more importantly than that, what I really want to do is try to go beyond the classic proof.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,060
Consider this hypothetical statistician's friend.

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,700
What I want to ask is, can we find an explanation that would satisfy their disbelief?

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,600
You see, they're not just asking for some pure math proof

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,980
about a function that was handed down to them on high.

37
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,580
The friend's incredulity was that circles should have anything to do with population statistics.

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,180
Until we fully draw that connecting line, we should consider the task incomplete.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,480
Those of you who watched the last video on the central limit theorem

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,160
will have some of the backdrop here,

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,340
because there we broke down the formula for a normal distribution,

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
which is also called a Gaussian distribution.

43
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,520
And when you strip away all of the different parameters and the constants,

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,280
the basic function that describes the bell curve shape is e to the negative x squared.

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
And the reason that pi showed up in the final formula

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
was that the area underneath this curve works out,

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,340
as you will see in a couple minutes, to be the square root of pi.

48
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,360
So what that meant for us was that at some point we needed to divide out by that square root of pi

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,700
to make sure that the area under the curve is one,

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,660
which is a requirement before you can interpret it as a probability distribution.

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,540
In the full formula that you would see, say, in a stats book,

52
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,260
this gets mixed together with some of the other constants,

53
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,100
but in its purest form that pi originates from the area underneath this curve.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,440
So step number one for you and me is to explain that area,

55
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,060
but I want to emphasize it's not the last step.

56
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,100
To satisfy the question raised by that hypothetical statistician's friend,

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,340
we need to go further.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,240
We need to also answer why is it that this function e to the negative x squared

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,860
is so special in the first place?

60
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,420
I mean, there are lots of different formulas you could write down

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,220
that would give a shape that, you know, vaguely bulges in the middle

62
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,100
and tapers out on either side.

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,860
So why is it that this specific function holds such a special place in statistics?

64
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,780
To phrase our goal another way, can we find a connection

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,220
between the proof that shows why pi shows up and the central limit theorem,

66
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,840
which, as we talked about in the last video, is the thing that explains

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,040
when you can expect a normal distribution to arise in nature.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,860
So with all of that as the goal, first things first,

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,280
let's dig into the classic and very beautiful proof.

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,620
All right, when you want to find the area underneath a curve,

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
the tool for doing that is an integral.

72
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,440
As a quick reminder for how you might read this notation,

73
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,800
you might imagine approximating that area with many different rectangles

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
under the curve, where the height of each such rectangle

75
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,460
is the value of the function above that point, in this case,

76
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,940
e to the negative x squared for a certain input x,

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,800
and the width is some little number that we're calling dx.

78
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,160
We need to add up the areas of all these rectangles,

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,320
for values of x ranging from negative infinity up to infinity,

80
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,560
and the use of that notation dx is kind of meant to imply

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,360
you shouldn't think of any specific width, but instead you ask,

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,140
as the chosen width for your rectangles gets thinner and thinner,

83
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,840
what does this sum of all those areas approach?

84
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,220
Of course, all of that is just notation unless you provide a way to answer that question,

85
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,380
and the magic of calculus is that it provides just that, at least usually.

86
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,620
You see, usually the procedure here would be to find

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,180
some function whose derivative is equal to the stuff we have on the inside,

88
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,560
e to the negative x squared.

89
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,880
In other words, we want to find an antiderivative of that function.

90
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,500
The problem is, for this particular function,

91
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,080
it is provably not possible to find such an antiderivative.

92
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,760
It's a little weird and beyond the scope of what I want to talk about here,

93
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,500
but basically, even though there exists an antiderivative,

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,760
it is a well-defined function, you cannot express what that antiderivative is

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,700
using all our usual tools, like polynomial expressions,

96
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,660
trig functions, exponentials, or any way to mix them together.

97
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,520
So finding this area requires a bit of cleverness.

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,460
There needs to be a new trick that we bring to bear.

99
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,380
And the first step to this trick is easily the most absurd.

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
We start by bumping things up one dimension,

101
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,640
so that instead of asking for the area under a bell curve,

102
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,360
we ask for the volume underneath this kind of bell surface.

103
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,340
You could rightly ask, why would you do that?

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,580
Who ordered another dimension?

105
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,740
And I'll admit, it's not terribly motivated right now,

106
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,620
other than to say, watch what happens when we just try it.

107
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,180
In general, with hard problems, it's never a bad idea to try solving cousins of the problem,

108
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,640
since that can help you get a little bit of momentum and insight.

109
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,020
To be clear on how this higher dimensional function is defined,

110
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,620
it takes in two different inputs, x and y,

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,120
which we might think of as a point on the xy-plane.

112
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,100
And the way to think about it is to consider the distance from that point to the origin,

113
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
which I'll label as r,

114
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,980
and then to plug in that distance to our original bell curve function,

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,420
that is, we take e to the negative r squared.

116
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,180
You might notice the lines I've drawn on this diagram make a right triangle.

117
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,140
So, by the Pythagorean theorem, x squared plus y squared equals r squared.

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,840
So in the function I have written, where you see x squared plus y squared,

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,280
you can think in the back of your mind,

120
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,460
that's really the square of the distance from the point to the origin.

121
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,780
The main thing to notice here is how this gives our function a kind of circular symmetry,

122
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,980
in the sense that all of the inputs that sit on a given circle have the same output.

123
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,080
And so when we graph this function in three dimensions,

124
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,380
it means it has a rotational symmetry about the z-axis.

125
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,780
Math tends to reward you when you respect its symmetries,

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,100
so for our question of computing the volume underneath the surface,

127
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,520
what we're going to do is respect that symmetry,

128
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,480
and imagine integrating together a bunch of thin little cylinders underneath that surface.

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,060
Here, making this a little more quantitative,

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,140
let's focus on just one of those cylindrical shells,

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,100
where its area is going to be the circumference of that shell times the height.

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,100
You might imagine it as something like the label on a soup can that we can unwrap into a rectangle.

133
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,740
The circumference of the cylinder, which is the top side of that rectangle,

134
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,260
is going to be 2 pi times the radius.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,080
And then the height of our cylinder, the other side of our rectangle,

136
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,420
is the height of the surface at this point,

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,680
which by definition is the value of our function associated with that radius,

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,360
which like I said earlier you can think of as e to the negative r squared.

139
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,920
Now the real way you want to think about this is to give that cylinder a little bit of thickness,

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:39,220
dr, so that the volume that it represents is approximately that area we just looked at,

141
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,980
multiplied by this thickness dr.

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,660
Our task now is to integrate together, or add together,

143
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,820
all of these different cylinders as r ranges between 0 and infinity.

144
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,120
Or more precisely, we consider what happens as that thickness gets thinner and thinner,

145
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,940
approaching 0, and we add together the volumes of the many many many different

146
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,120
thin cylinders that sit underneath that curve.

147
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,420
You might think this is just a harder version of what we were looking at earlier,

148
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,860
three dimensions should be more complicated than two.

149
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,480
But actually something very helpful has happened.

150
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,000
First let me clean up a little by factoring the pi outside that integral.

151
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,700
Now the stuff inside that integral, having picked up this term 2r,

152
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,540
does have an antiderivative.

153
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,980
We can now apply the usual tactics of calculus.

154
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,340
Specifically, that whole inside expression is the derivative of negative e to the negative r squared.

155
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,140
And so, those of you comfortable with calculus know what to do from here.

156
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,960
We take that antiderivative and plug in the upper bound, which is negative infinity squared,

157
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,500
and that gives us 0, or speaking a little bit more precisely,

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,440
if you consider the limit of this expression as the input approaches infinity, the limiting value is 0,

159
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,600
and we subtract off the value of that antiderivative at the lower bound, 0,

160
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,500
which in this case is negative 1.

161
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,680
So all in all, the whole integral just works out to be 1,

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
which means all we're left with is that factor out in front, pi.

163
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,940
Evidently, the volume underneath this bell surface is pi.

164
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,320
And I'll point out in this case, it's not wild that pi shows up,

165
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,000
because the surface has this intrinsic circular symmetry.

166
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,060
Still, you might wonder, how does that help us?

167
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,120
As I said, throughout math, if you face a hard problem,

168
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,780
solving an adjacent problem can be unexpectedly helpful as a next step.

169
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,700
And in this case, it's helpful not just for building intuition,

170
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,820
but we can directly relate the three-dimensional graph to our two-dimensional graph

171
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,920
by analyzing the volume in a second, different way.

172
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,560
You see, the more general way to approach volumes underneath surfaces

173
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,880
is to think of chopping it up into slices that are all parallel to one of the axes.

174
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,220
For example, all these slices that are parallel to the x-axis.

175
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,340
For example, this right here is a slice that corresponds to the plane y equals 0.

176
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,700
You might notice it looks just like a bell curve,

177
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,760
and if we write out the function, this should actually make a lot of sense.

178
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,980
You could just plug in y equals 0, but to help see what happens with other slices,

179
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,340
notice how, thanks to the rules of exponentiation,

180
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,080
we could also write our function as e to the negative x squared times e to the negative y squared.

181
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,480
It factors out nicely.

182
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,280
On this slice, that e to the negative y squared is just a number, specifically the number 1.

183
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,900
So this is the same graph we've seen before, e to the negative x squared,

184
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,080
meaning that the area of this slice is exactly the thing that we're looking for.

185
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,220
It's the mystery constant, which I'm going to give the name c.

186
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,100
What's nice is there's nothing really special about this particular slice.

187
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,900
If we chose a different slice corresponding to a different y value,

188
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,080
it corresponds to multiplying this curve by a different number.

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,940
So it's the same basic shape, just scaled down by that number,

190
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,540
meaning its area is the same as our mystery constant, just scaled down by some number.

191
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,720
That's pretty cool.

192
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,280
Each one of these slices has the same basic shape, just rescaled in the vertical direction,

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,260
which, by the way, is not at all true for most two-variable functions.

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,360
This is very much dependent on the fact that we were able to factor our function

195
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,200
into one part that's just dependent on the y and another part that's just dependent on the x.

196
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Now, to think about the volume underneath this whole surface,

197
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,760
here's another way we could phrase it.

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,820
We're going to compute another integral that ranges from y equals negative infinity up to infinity,

199
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,140
where the term inside that integral tells us the area of each one of those slices.

200
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,220
And when we multiply it by a little thickness dy,

201
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,700
you might think of it as giving each one of those slices a little bit of volume.

202
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,360
And remember, that term c sitting in front represents the thing we want to know,

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,840
which itself is an integral, a suspiciously similar-looking integral.

204
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,240
See, if we take the expression on the top and we factor out that constant c,

205
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,840
because it's just a number, it doesn't depend on y,

206
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,900
the thing we're left with, the integral we need to compute,

207
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,840
is exactly the mystery constant, the thing we don't know.

208
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,380
So overall, the volume underneath this bell surface works out to be this mystery constant squared.

209
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,700
Out of context, this might seem very unhelpful,

210
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,100
it's just relating one thing we don't know to another thing we don't know,

211
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,300
except we've already computed the volume under this surface, we know that it's equal to pi.

212
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,000
Therefore, the mystery constant we want to know, the area underneath this bell curve,

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,820
must be the square root of pi.

214
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,160
It's a very pretty argument, but a few things are not entirely satisfying.

215
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,180
For one thing, it feels a little bit like a trick, something that just happened to work

216
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,800
without offering much of a sense for how you could have rediscovered it yourself.

217
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,320
Also, if we think back to our imagined statistician's friend,

218
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,420
it doesn't really answer their question,

219
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,800
which was what do circles have to do with population statistics?

220
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,860
Like I said, it's the first step, not the last, and as our next step,

221
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,700
let's see if we can unpack why this proof is not quite as wild and arbitrary as you might first think,

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,840
and how it relates to an explanation for where this function e to the negative x squared

223
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,600
is coming from in the first place.

224
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,840
John Herschel was this mathematician slash scientist slash inventor

225
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,060
who really did all sorts of things throughout the 19th century.

226
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,940
He made contributions in chemistry, astronomy, photography, botany,

227
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,120
he invented the blueprint and named many of the moons in our solar system,

228
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,180
and in the midst of all of this, he also offered a very elegant little derivation

229
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,660
for the Gaussian distribution in 1850.

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,640
The setup is to imagine that you want to describe some kind of probability distribution

231
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,080
in two-dimensional space.

232
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,500
For instance, maybe you want to model the probability density for hits on a dartboard.

233
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,840
What Herschel showed is that if you want this distribution to satisfy

234
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,280
two pretty reasonable seeming properties, your hand is unexpectedly forced,

235
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,120
and even if you had never heard of a Gaussian in your life,

236
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,200
you would be inexorably drawn to use a function with the shape

237
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,560
e to the negative x squared plus y squared.

238
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,400
You do have one degree of freedom to control the spread of that distribution,

239
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,280
and of course there's going to be some constant sitting in front to make sure it's normalized,

240
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,620
but the point is that we're forced into this very specific kind of bell curve shape.

241
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,900
The first of these two properties is that the probability density around each point

242
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,140
depends only on its distance from the origin, not on its direction.

243
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,620
So on a dartboard with everybody aiming for the bullseye,

244
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,460
this would mean that you could rotate the board and it would make no difference for the distribution.

245
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,360
Mathematically, this means that the function describing your probability distribution,

246
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,140
which I'll call f2 since it takes in two inputs x and y,

247
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,620
well it can be expressed as some single variable function of the radius r.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,560
And just to spell it out, r is the distance between the point xy and the origin,

249
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,820
the square root of x squared plus y squared.

250
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,120
Property number two is that the x and y coordinates of each point are independent from each other,

251
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,920
which is to say if you learn the x coordinate of a point,

252
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,620
it would give you no information about the y coordinate.

253
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,640
The way this looks as an equation is that our function,

254
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,280
which describes the probability density around each point on the xy plane,

255
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,840
can be factored into two different parts,

256
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,180
one of which can be purely written in terms of x,

257
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,220
this is the distribution of the x coordinate, I'm giving it the name g,

258
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,000
and the other part is purely in terms of y, this would be the distribution for the y coordinate,

259
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,000
which I'm temporarily calling h.

260
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,760
But if you combine this with the assumption that things are radially symmetric,

261
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,180
both of these should be the same distribution, the behavior on each axis should look the same.

262
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,360
So we could also write this as g of x times g of y, it's the same function.

263
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,440
And more than that, this function is actually going to be proportional to the one we were

264
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,580
looking at, the one that describes our probability density as a function of the radius,

265
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,260
the distance away from the origin.

266
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,760
To see this, imagine you were to analyze a point that was on the x-axis,

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,780
a distance r away from the origin.

268
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,000
Then the two distinct ways to express our function based on the two different properties

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,980
tells us that f of r has to equal some constant multiplied by g of r.

270
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,500
So these functions f and g are basically the same thing, just up to some constant multiple.

271
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,840
And you know what?

272
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,380
It would be really nice if we could just assume that that constant was one,

273
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,080
so that f and g were literally the same function.

274
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,600
And what I'm going to do, which might feel a little bit cheeky, is just assume that that is the case.

275
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,660
What this means is that our answer is going to be a little bit wrong.

276
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,380
The function that we will deduce describing this distribution will be off by some constant factor.

277
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,820
But that's no big deal, because in the end we can just rescale to make sure the area

278
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,960
under the curve is one, like we always do with probability distributions.

279
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,920
Now, if f and g are the same thing, this gives us a very nice little equation

280
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,840
purely in terms of the function f.

281
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,200
Remember what this function f is.

282
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,900
If you have some point in the xy-plane, a distance r from the origin,

283
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,260
then f of r tells you the relative likelihood of that point showing up in the random process.

284
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
More specifically, it gives the probability density of that point.

285
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,320
At the outset, this function could have been anything, but Herschel's two different properties

286
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,880
evidently imply something kind of funny about it, which is that if we take the x and y coordinates

287
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,460
of that point on the plane and evaluate this function on them separately, taking f of x times f

288
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,940
of y, it should give us the same result. Or if you prefer, we could expand out the meaning of that

289
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,180
distance r as the square root of x squared plus y squared, and this is what our key equation looks like.

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,880
This kind of equation is what's known in the business as a functional equation.

291
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,040
We're not solving for an unknown number.

292
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,280
Instead, we're saying that the equation is true for all possible numbers x and y,

293
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,260
and the thing we're trying to find is an unknown function.

294
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,520
In the back of your mind, you can think we already know one function that satisfies this property,

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,380
e to the negative x squared, and as a sanity check, you might verify for yourself that it does satisfy that.

296
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,780
Of course, the point is to pretend that you don't know that, and to instead deduce what all of the

297
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,800
functions are which satisfy this property.

298
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,420
In general, functional equations can be quite tricky, but let me show you how you can solve this one.

299
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,700
First, it's nice to introduce a little helper function that I'll call h of x,

300
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,960
which will be defined as our mystery function evaluated at the square root of x.

301
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,020
Said another way, h of x squared is the same thing as f of x.

302
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,740
For example, in the back of your mind where you know that e to the negative x squared will happen

303
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,360
to be one of the answers, this little helper function h would be e to the negative x.

304
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
But again, we're pretending like we don't know that.

305
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,760
The reason for doing this is that the key property for f looks a little bit nicer if we phrase it in

306
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,480
terms of this helper function h, because now what it's saying is if you take two arbitrary positive

307
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,860
numbers and you add them up and evaluate h, it's the same thing as evaluating h on them separately

308
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,380
and then multiplying the results. In a sense, it turns addition into multiplication.

309
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,940
Some of you might see where this is going, but let's take a moment to walk through why this forces our hand.

310
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,160
As a next step, you might want to pause and convince yourself that if this property is true

311
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,880
for the sum of two numbers, this property also must be true if we add up an arbitrary number of inputs.

312
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,040
To get a feel for why this is so constraining, think about plugging in a whole number,

313
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,680
something like h of 5. Because you can write 5 as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1,

314
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,180
this key property means that it must equal h of 1 multiplied by itself five times.

315
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Of course, there's nothing special about 5. I could have chosen any whole number n,

316
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,620
and we'd be forced to conclude that the function looks like some number raised to the power n.

317
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,840
And let's go ahead and give that number a name, like b for the base of our exponential.

318
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,920
As a little mini exercise here, see if you can pause and take a moment to convince yourself

319
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,000
that the same is true for a rational input, that if you plug in p over q to this function,

320
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,060
it must look like this base b raised to the power p over q.

321
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,200
And as a hint, you might want to think about adding that input to itself q different times.

322
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,120
And then because rational numbers are dense in the real number line, if we make one more pretty

323
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,500
reasonable assumption that we only care about continuous functions, this is enough to force

324
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,620
your hand completely and say that h has to be an exponential function, b to the power x,

325
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,300
for all real number inputs x. I guess to be more precise I should say for all positive real inputs.

326
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,520
The way we defined h, it's only taking in positive numbers.

327
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,400
Now, as we've gone over before, instead of writing down exponential functions as some

328
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,260
base raised to the power x, mathematicians often like to write them as e to the power of some

329
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,020
constant c times x. Making the choice to always use e as a base while letting that constant c

330
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,600
determine which specific exponential function you're talking about just makes everything much

331
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,720
easier any time calculus comes wandering along your path. And so this means that our target

332
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,580
function f has to look like e to the power of some constant times x squared. The beauty is that that

333
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,560
function is no longer something that was merely handed down to us from on high. Instead we started

334
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,960
with these two different premises for how we wanted a distribution in two dimensions to behave,

335
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,880
and we were drawn to the conclusion that the shape of the expression describing that distribution

336
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,200
as a function of the radius away from the origin has to be e to the power of some constant times

337
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,680
that radius squared. You'll remember I said earlier this answer will be off by a factor of a constant.

338
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,560
We need to rescale it to make it a valid probability distribution, and geometrically you might think of

339
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,900
that as scaling it so that the volume under the surface is equal to one. Now you might notice that

340
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,100
for positive values of this constant in the exponent c, our function blows up to infinity in

341
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,980
all directions, so the volume under that surface would be infinite, meaning it's not possible to

342
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,040
renormalize. You can't turn it into a probability distribution. And that leaves us with the last

343
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,340
constraint, which is that this constant in the exponent has to be a negative number, and the

344
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,400
specific value of that number determines the spread of the distribution. Ten years after Herschel wrote

345
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,840
this, James Clerk Maxwell, who's most well known for having written down the fundamental equations

346
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,800
for electricity and magnetism, independently stumbled across the same derivation. In his case

347
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,300
he was doing it in three dimensions since he was doing statistical mechanics and he was deriving a

348
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,680
formula for the distribution for velocities of molecules in a gas, but the logic all works out

349
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,120
the same. For you and me, if we view this as the defining property of a Gaussian, then it's a little

350
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,600
bit less surprising that pi might make an appearance. After all, circular symmetry was part of this

351
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,700
defining property. More than that, it makes the clever proof that we saw earlier feel a little bit

352
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,320
less out of the blue. I mean, a key problem-solving principle in math is to use the defining features

353
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,100
of your setup, and if you had been primed by this Herschel-Maxwell derivation, where the defining

354
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,780
property for a Gaussian is this coincidence of having a distribution that's both radially

355
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,580
symmetric and also independent along each axis, then the very first step of our proof, which seemed

356
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,840
so strange bumping the problem up one dimension, was really just a way of opening the door to let

357
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,520
that defining property make itself visible. And if you think back, the essence of the proof came

358
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,440
down to using that radial symmetry on the one hand, and then also using the ability to factor

359
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,920
the function on the other. From this standpoint, using both those facts feels less like a trick

360
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:02,240
that happened to work, and more like an inevitable necessity. Nevertheless, thinking once again of

361
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,540
our statistician's friend, this is still not entirely satisfying. Using the Herschel-Maxwell

362
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,020
derivation, saying this property of a multi-dimensional distribution is what defines

363
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:17,220
a Gaussian, presumes that we're already in some kind of multi-dimensional situation in the first

364
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,800
place. Much more commonly, the way that a normal distribution arises in practice doesn't feel

365
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,920
spatial or geometric at all. It stems from the central limit theorem, which is all about adding

366
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,220
together many different independent variables. So to bring it all home here, what we need to do is

367
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,160
explain why the function that's characterized by this Herschel-Maxwell derivation should be

368
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,780
the same thing as the function that sits at the heart of the central limit theorem.

369
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,460
And at this point, those of you following along are probably going to make fun of me,

370
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,680
I think it makes sense to pull this last step out as its own video.

371
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,120
Oh, and one final footnote here. After making a Patreon post about this particular project,

372
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,480
one patron, who's a mathematician named Kevin Ega, shared something completely delightful that I had

373
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,740
never seen before, which is that if you apply this integration trick in higher dimensions,

374
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,780
it lets you derive the formulas for volumes of higher dimensional spheres.

375
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,740
It's a very fun exercise, I'm leaving the details up on the screen for any viewers

376
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,140
who are comfortable with integration by parts. Thank you very much to Kevin for sharing that one,

377
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,380
and thanks to all patrons, by the way, both for the support of the channel,

378
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,400
and also for all the feedback you offer on the early drafts of videos.

379
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:45,100
Thank you.
