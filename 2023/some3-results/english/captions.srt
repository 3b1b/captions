00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,697
This year we ran the third Summer of Math Exposition, 

2
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:06,992
which is a contest aimed at encouraging more people to put up math explainers online, 

3
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:09,040
in whatever way they dream of doing that.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,340
A lot of them are videos, not all of them are videos.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,617
Every year we select some winners, but I say at every time the contest is not 

6
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:20,040
actually about the winners, success looks like getting more good explanations online.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,282
Now last year in the winner announcement video I talked 

8
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,860
all about the specific criteria I try to think about.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,380
I won't necessarily repeat that here, you can watch that one for all that.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,052
Instead, I thought I'd just go down 25 different entries 

11
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:36,660
and say a couple of words on what I like about each one.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,559
Before I dive in, I gotta be honest, I found it especially hard this year to actually 

13
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,040
make the decisions for what constitutes an honorable mention, what constitutes a winner.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,163
And to be clear, I'm not the only one making decisions here, 

15
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,215
we have a whole bunch of guest judges who helped, 

16
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm really just assembling my own feedback on everyone else's.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,840
But nevertheless, at some point you have to make a call that says this one is a winner, 

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,420
or this one is an honorable mention.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,816
And I think I realized one of the reasons it was so hard is I don't think 

20
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:09,680
there's such a thing as a generally good math explainer for a general audience.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,996
I think there's such a thing as a pretty good video for a general audience, 

22
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:17,600
and I think there's such a thing as great videos for very specific audiences.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,267
And in some ways it's that second category that is where the internet really shines, 

24
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,686
where you have something that maybe isn't perfectly tailored for everyone 

25
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,151
because it can't be, but for that particular audience that it's great for, 

26
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:31,600
it's kind of the best thing you could have asked for.

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,500
And I'll actually give one example.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,540
So one of the entries that I want to showcase for you is called Pixel Art Anti-Aliasing.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,705
It's all about the task of taking a piece of two-dimensional, 

30
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:45,171
really low resolution pixel art, but displaying it in a three-dimensional, 

31
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,020
potentially high resolution environment.

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,273
I found it fascinating, and I think anyone who's really into computer graphics, 

33
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:53,719
and especially anyone who enjoys shader programming, 

34
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,520
would find this completely fascinating.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,142
For that specific audience, I am very confident in saying, 

36
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:01,120
watch it, you'll enjoy it, you're going to get something out of it.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,881
Now, this one does a good job of motivating the mathematical ideas that go into it, 

38
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:07,240
even if you aren't necessarily into shader programming.

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,420
But if I'm expanding the scope of who I might be recommending this to, 

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,823
to any generally math-curious internet goer, well, you know, 

41
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:18,895
it makes a couple assumptions for things you might know about that maybe 

42
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:19,900
not everyone does.

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,477
And, to be fair, omitting certain fundamentals 

44
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,000
is the correct choice for the target audience.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,892
Now the next entry, and by the way, I randomly sorted this 

46
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:31,417
list of content that I want to go through ahead of time, 

47
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,340
I'll talk about which ones were chosen as winners at the very end.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,480
This next one is called The Math of Saving the Enola Gay.

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,835
So this is talking about the plane which dropped the nuclear bombs in World War II, 

50
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:45,765
and the author acknowledges that there's some obvious moral questions associated 

51
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,743
with the mission itself, but the focus is on the surprisingly interesting physics 

52
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:53,770
question of the best route that the plane should take after dropping the weapon to 

53
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,040
avoid paying potentially calamitous consequences of the aftershock of the weapon itself.

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,941
And what I appreciate is that he really does go 

55
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,860
into the full detail of the problem itself.

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,220
And this is the kind of video lecture I could imagine as being a really, 

57
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,861
really excellent case study that you could use in a high school physics class or 

58
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:10,760
something like that.

59
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,222
It's a worked example that covers a lot of very 

60
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:16,100
fundamental ideas that you would need for a class like that.

61
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,080
And whereas often on YouTube it can make sense to kind of skip over some 

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,700
of the heavier details and mention that this is best left as an exercise 

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,370
to the viewer or something like that, I really respect those who actually 

64
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,090
do step through all of the detail because that most authentically reflects 

65
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,760
what the feeling of doing math is and the amount of time that it can take.

66
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,122
So it's definitely something to watch when you're in the mood for details, 

67
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,400
but when you are, it's excellent.

68
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,720
Next up is Making a Pitch Shifter.

69
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,880
And so this is the technology that allows you to auto-tune and things like that.

70
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,086
And also it's an equivalent problem to how you speed 

71
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:52,020
up or slow down audio without changing the pitch of it.

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,708
For example, I imagine a lot of you are watching this video at 1.5x or 2x, 

73
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,037
and if you step back and think about what's required to make that work, 

74
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,980
it's actually a very interesting question.

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,087
And this video goes through a lot of the different ways that you might think about it, 

76
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,560
some of the initial approaches, quirks associated with those.

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
It shows the code that he's using along the way.

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,740
It's a great practical problem, and who doesn't love a little more forte in their lives?

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,260
Next up we have a non-video entry.

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,839
This one is Cayley Graphs and Pretty Things.

81
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,077
And this is another example where, for the right audience, 

82
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,880
this is an excellent piece of content.

83
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,560
And in this case, I think that audience would be students in group theory.

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,965
And in particular, I think what it does an excellent 

85
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:33,300
job describing is the semi-direct product.

86
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,655
So it describes a lot of other things, but it builds up to this, 

87
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:39,792
which is a very specific and kind of niche thing that a group theory 

88
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:43,020
student might come across, might be a little bit confusing in the book.

89
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,071
And the way that everything is explained here gives a really satisfying 

90
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:50,340
mental image that you can hold in your head for that, which is great.

91
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,240
Ah, okay, the next one is the longest increasing subsequence.

92
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,000
And you know, I talk about one of the things I'm 

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,280
looking for as being memorable pieces of content.

94
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,797
And this channel definitely satisfies that, because for the last three years, 

95
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:05,920
I remember the entries that they put in.

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,611
They have a very particular style, a very distinctively clear 

97
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,600
way of talking about what would usually be rather technical topics.

98
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,351
And here, I'm envisioning the target audience as probably being the 

99
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,760
same kind of people who would attend like a seminar in a math department, 

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,800
curious undergrads or some of the grad students in the department.

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,865
Because it describes a problem which, to be perfectly fair, 

102
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,000
you might not care about if you're not already super into math.

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,692
It's talking about if you have a random permutation, 

104
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:37,720
what might you expect the longest increasing subsequence in that permutation to be?

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
So a very natural but very pure question.

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,552
And the tactics brought to studying this are surprising, 

107
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,285
but really well motivated in the context of the video, 

108
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:48,720
and I think just really beautiful to think about.

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,440
Next up, we've got another non-video entry, the Matrix Arcade.

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,186
And this one, I think I remember in the peer review, 

111
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:57,940
might have gotten marked down a little bit more than some of the others.

112
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,596
And I'm guessing it's because one of the things we 

113
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:03,180
mentioned looking for in any given content piece is novelty.

114
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,863
And in terms of topic matter, this one covers a lot of the same things 

115
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:09,860
as the Essence of Linear Algebra series that I made way back when.

116
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,490
But I do actually think this one is worth highlighting because even if 

117
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,814
there's overlap in the subject matter, I think presenting it in this mode 

118
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:20,184
in an interactive way where at the end you offer a playground that someone 

119
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:23,374
can go through, and along the way each idea is really well illustrated 

120
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:26,520
on the main screen and really well described in the text on the right.

121
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,619
That adds something that I wanted to see added to the space for a long time, 

122
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:34,320
and I could absolutely see recommending this to teachers of linear algebra.

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
It's a great link that you can send to someone.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,902
Next in my randomly sorted list of featured content 

125
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,600
is a video called Watching Neural Networks Learn.

126
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,560
And on the one hand, it's very beautiful.

127
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,644
A lot of the imagery comes from a certain way to visualize the gradient 

128
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:52,480
descent process or what the neural network can do during that process.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,614
But the thing that really sold this for me was not so much the nice visuals, 

130
00:06:56,614 --> 00:07:00,154
but there's a really thought-provoking discussion in here on the choices that 

131
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:03,740
you can make as you set up the network and what different features you can use.

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,423
And in the context of learning a function that describes a two-dimensional image, 

133
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:12,140
why Fourier series in particular end up giving dramatically better results.

134
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,012
And I had never thought about this particular combination of ideas before, 

135
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,880
and I thought it was just really fascinating.

136
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,140
Next up we've got an article, Functions are Vectors.

137
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,700
This is one of those topics that's just very important.

138
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,888
There's a time in your life before you think about functions as vectors, 

139
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:30,000
and there's a time in your life after you think about functions as vectors.

140
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,045
And this article was just very thorough and well explained, 

141
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:36,759
and I think it's one of the best resources out there to transition someone between 

142
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,520
those two states.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,980
Next up we've got The Art of Linear Programming.

144
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,961
And this addresses a class of problems that come up in computer science 

145
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,220
and the algorithmic way of thinking about a good way to solve them.

146
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,282
And the approach that the author takes, which I always think is a very good 

147
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:54,785
one in any kind of education, is to just start with one of the most simple, 

148
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:58,334
non-trivial examples that you can have, and really just working through what 

149
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:02,390
everything looks like in that context, as he then goes on to describe the more general, 

150
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,940
or sometimes more constrained situations where those similar ideas can apply.

151
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,278
It's well illustrated, the ideas along the way are well motivated, 

152
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:12,080
so just a bang up job all around.

153
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,300
This next one is actually a little different.

154
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,280
It's called The Mosaic Problem, How and Why to Do Math for Fun.

155
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,840
So the author is describing a very specific question that they were once contemplating.

156
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,046
You know, I think a criticism that you could lay is that there's not a lot of motivation 

157
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:31,300
for why you might care about the problem, but that's not actually what the video is about.

158
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,325
He's really just using this as an example of what he calls a backburner problem, 

159
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:38,115
and this is an idea that I think is very much worth getting 

160
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,299
into the minds of more math students out there.

161
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,063
Essentially it's that if you have some sort of problem that you care about and you think 

162
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:48,954
about, even if no one else does, as long as it sprouts out your own curiosity, 

163
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:53,239
and when you go into new math classes, you have that as a problem that you can kind of 

164
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:57,474
turn to every now and then, it offers a fertile ground for adding context to a lot of 

165
00:08:57,474 --> 00:09:01,759
math out there which is sometimes so desperately lacking a good context that motivates 

166
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,400
the students.

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,804
So for his particular question, this mosaic problem, 

168
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:09,855
he talks about how it made relevant certain ideas like generating functions and 

169
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,780
principles of inclusion and exclusion.

170
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,200
And his broader point is not that this particular problem is the 

171
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,165
most important in the world, but that having a backburner problem 

172
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:21,400
of some kind is actually one of the best ways to stay engaged with math.

173
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,220
And that I would definitely agree with.

174
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,488
And I guess on the topic of problems which probably don't really matter, 

175
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:33,375
but are fun to think about and end up being a path to some actually interesting math, 

176
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,103
the next one, affording a planet with geometry, 

177
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:40,706
is I think the only claymation entry that I saw this year used to good effect in 

178
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:45,309
describing a certain optimization problem framed in the context of deciding what 

179
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:50,025
shape you want to turn your planet into if you want to experience a certain amount 

180
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,640
of gravity but not use too much mass to do it.

181
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,420
It's well explained.

182
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,080
If you're into that kind of problem, definitely check it out.

183
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,080
Next up we've got when can't math be generalized, the limits of analytic continuation.

184
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,870
And thinking in terms of target audiences, anyone who's taking a complex analysis class, 

185
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,660
this is outstanding, perfect for them.

186
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,892
Anyone who might have a complex analysis class in their future, 

187
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:14,860
I think this does a good job setting up some of the ideas that you run across in that.

188
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,944
It's not talking about generalizing math in the sense of applying it to 

189
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:22,700
a general set of circumstances, but in a setting where sometimes you can 

190
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,560
take a function defined on one domain and extend that definition beyond it.

191
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,420
There are circumstances where you actually can't do that.

192
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,610
And he offers a really clear description of what exactly we mean by 

193
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,750
extending in this context and then an example where you can't do that 

194
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,532
that seems like it's sort of dropped in from out of the blue, 

195
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:42,762
but it gives a really satisfying reason for why this example would have 

196
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:46,800
the properties that it does with some suggestion for how you might have come up with that.

197
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,060
And the next up is just a very cute example of an argument in geometry.

198
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,097
Some of you might have thought about this before, 

199
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,685
but if you translate something and then rotate it, 

200
00:10:56,685 --> 00:11:00,541
or maybe you rotate and then translate, it's always possible to express the 

201
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,840
composite motion there as some kind of rotation about some point.

202
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,068
And of course there's a slight caveat there where if you just translate 

203
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,720
it but rotate it at zero degrees, that's not the same as a rotation.

204
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,520
And this video offers just a really well-illustrated proof of why that's the case.

205
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,210
And I think what stuck out to me is the way that the second half of the 

206
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,153
proof was framed in terms of this kind of game that you're playing with a certain demon, 

207
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:24,299
which takes what otherwise is maybe a little bit of a confusing set of 

208
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,534
logical steps that leads to a contradiction, and instead just makes it a 

209
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,680
little easier to hold onto while you're following all of the reasoning.

210
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,380
So I appreciated that.

211
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,760
Ah, so the next one, rethinking the real line.

212
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,818
I really liked this one, and it stood out from many others, 

213
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:41,316
for one thing just because it felt very natural, 

214
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:45,496
like the presentation didn't feel like it was scripted or over-edited in any way, 

215
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,740
but what really shone is the subject matter.

216
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,580
And again, I think the sense in which it's great is for a particular target audience.

217
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,473
So in this case, if you've ever thought about visualizing rational numbers or rational 

218
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:01,785
approximations of irrational numbers, it offers just a really dense set of very nice 

219
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:06,350
ideas for how to think about these topics, and they're all connected with each other very 

220
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,865
nicely, and I for one felt like I came out of it armed with a few more mental constructs 

221
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:15,380
for how to think about a few of these ideas, which is of course just such a nice feeling.

222
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,480
Alright, next we've got, how did the ancient Egyptians find this volume without algebra?

223
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,689
So this is a question which is interesting in terms of the history of math, 

224
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:27,720
or what you can do without certain ideas that we take for granted.

225
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,232
So the problem at hand is how you find the volume of 

226
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,200
essentially a pyramid where you cut off the top of it.

227
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,120
The author talks about how the Egyptians had this formula for it, 

228
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,911
which is of course not written algebraically, people didn't think algebraically back 

229
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:47,590
then, but he addresses how it's actually very surprising to get to that formula if 

230
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,325
you don't think algebraically, and so tries to address the problem of how might you 

231
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:56,891
find this idea as an algorithm for finding the volume not expressed as a formula 

232
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:01,796
without being able to manipulate the formulas that you or I would naturally manipulate 

233
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:02,980
to land on that idea.

234
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,740
This next one I think has one of the best hooks of any of the ones that I've seen before.

235
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,247
So he essentially asks if you're swinging a ball on a rope above your head, 

236
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:17,795
and then at some point you release the rope, you let go of the rope, 

237
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:22,321
what happens to the ball with the three possibilities that it continues on the circular 

238
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:26,074
path, that it continues on the straight line path tangent to the circle, 

239
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:28,800
or it goes on the straight path away from the circle.

240
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,917
And I guess I'll just say it's not the answer that most people say it is, 

241
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:36,011
and he does I think a really good job laying out the intuition for 

242
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,060
why that's not the case, and then demonstrating it experimentally.

243
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,781
Also on the more physics-oriented side of things, 

244
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,280
we have the math of bubbles, minimal surfaces and the calculus of variations.

245
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,619
So again, there's a great hook here, where the problem at hand is to understand the 

246
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:57,424
shape of the surface that you get if you take two cylindrical boundaries and then form 

247
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:02,064
a bubble in between them, where the relevant physics at play is that bubbles try to 

248
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:06,980
have the minimal surface area that they can, subject to some kind of boundary conditions.

249
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,557
The way to solve this problem is to bring in something 

250
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,100
known as the calculus of variations.

251
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,663
It's very important in other contexts, for example if any of you have ever heard of 

252
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:19,850
Lagrangian mechanics, and the author here describes the general framework used for not 

253
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,305
just this problem but a wide category of problems, 

254
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,520
and works through it for this particular case.

255
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,960
Again, it's one of those where to get the most out of it, 

256
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,938
you've got to be in the mood for some details, 

257
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:32,556
and in this one he does leave a lot of room to kind of pause and think through things 

258
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:35,670
where if certain steps are something you might have thought about before, 

259
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,289
you don't have to linger on it too much, but definitely if it's the first time you're 

260
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,351
going through any calculus of variation example, 

261
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:44,002
it is something you kind of need to stop and digest for a bit, 

262
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:45,980
and he leaves the room for that, which is nice.

263
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,385
Next up is another non-video entry, which I think is a really just 

264
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:53,277
perfect example for any Calculus 2 class out there, 

265
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:58,060
so any teachers looking to pull in something, I think this is a really great resource.

266
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,740
The question is very simply, how do computers calculate logarithms?

267
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,480
What happens when you're clicking that button?

268
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,830
He goes into things like Taylor series, but then perhaps more importantly, 

269
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,619
why the simple naive Taylor series approach here doesn't 

270
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,360
necessarily get you something as good as you might want.

271
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,575
That last step is really well-motivated, really well-described, 

272
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,180
so if you're curious, go take a look.

273
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Next on the docket we have, what happens if you add fractions incorrectly?

274
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,861
So if you ask elementary schoolers to add fractions together, 

275
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:29,620
there's kind of this instinct to just add the numerators and add the denominators.

276
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,617
If that's happening, it's probably a sign that the student doesn't 

277
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:35,537
appreciate what's actually being represented, or that the rules of math 

278
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:38,660
actually have a reason for them, and you need to think through those reasons.

279
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,969
But the funny thing is, that operation, which is not adding fractions, 

280
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:47,740
is actually the start of a surprisingly far-ranging set of ideas in other parts of math.

281
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,582
It has a special name, it's known as the mediant, 

282
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,219
and the author essentially walks through this pretty wide space 

283
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:58,540
of different things that this seemingly arbitrary operation can lead you to.

284
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,560
It's actually pretty connected with the one we were talking about a couple 

285
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,100
minutes ago on re-imagining the reals, things like rational approximations.

286
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,900
It also talks about Dirichlet's theorem.

287
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,080
Forward circles are in there, who doesn't love a good forward circle?

288
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,560
So if you're curious about the meandering set of ideas that you can be led to here, 

289
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,780
definitely do take a look.

290
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,880
Next we've got, can you guess a shape from its shadows?

291
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,840
So maybe you've thought about this kind of problem before, 

292
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,736
if you take a 3D shape and you look at its shadow from one direction, 

293
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,460
shadow from another, and then shadow from a third, can you reconstruct what that shape is?

294
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,612
And he mentions a seemingly obvious example, where all three of those shadows are 

295
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:37,157
squares, so you think the answer is a cube, but it's actually dramatically more 

296
00:16:37,157 --> 00:16:41,100
interesting than a cube, and he talks about the set of shapes that you can get from this.

297
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,108
Ah, okay, so the next one, stylistically, is one of the most distinct of all of them, 

298
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:50,815
which I always appreciate, especially if I'm going through hundreds 

299
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:53,760
of different explainers and trying to make a decision.

300
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,060
At first when I was watching this, I was like, wait, what's going on here?

301
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,720
Why is he just kind of like walking around in a bunch of different places?

302
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,443
But he has this really kind of calming way of incorporating a 

303
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:06,812
bunch of different environments and nature into these otherwise 

304
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:10,339
sometimes pretty technical descriptions of what he's talking about.

305
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,099
And the topic matter, broadly speaking, is fixed point theorems.

306
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,177
So this is one where I can imagine the target audience being like a 

307
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:20,140
math major or someone who has reason to care about fixed point theorems.

308
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,160
And as it goes on, he does get into some real depth of it.

309
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,359
We're closing in now towards the end of my randomly sorted list of featured videos.

310
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,620
I guess the next one is not actually a video.

311
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,380
I keep saying video is a generic stand-in for content.

312
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,315
But the next one is an article describing how computers represent numbers, 

313
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,000
in particular floating point numbers.

314
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,461
And I've seen other explainers for floating point representations out there before, 

315
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,840
but I think this is the best one that I've seen.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,704
And I really appreciate the approach that he takes, 

317
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:52,178
which is to have you imagine that you want to represent them and go through a refined 

318
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:56,235
set of ideas where each one is not quite what the final answer ends up being, 

319
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,420
but motivates the next step in a nice way.

320
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,973
This genre of discovery fiction, I think, works especially well when you have topics 

321
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:06,940
that seem like they have a lot of arbitrary or unexpected choices along the way.

322
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,500
It's just really well explained.

323
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,360
I liked it a lot.

324
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
All right, next on the list, we've got mathematical magic mirror ball.

325
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,920
Say that five times fast.

326
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,322
Essentially describing how if you take a picture of a spherical mirror, 

327
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:25,700
you can use that image to reconstruct a 360 degree view of the room all around it.

328
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,360
And he described how that works, what it's used for, what the trade-offs are, 

329
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,520
all around just a great application of a pretty surprising phenomenon.

330
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,920
This penultimate one on my list is just actually kind of amazing.

331
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,161
The person built this machine, which will weave a string along a whole bunch of pegs 

332
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:48,142
around a circle, such that as those strings intersect very densely at some points to 

333
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:53,300
make it dark and very sparsely at others to make it light, you can reconstruct an image.

334
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,820
That's just amazing that such a thing is possible.

335
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,298
And the author describes the process for how this was made and 

336
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:02,380
the various ideas that he tried, the reasons that they didn't work.

337
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,340
It both motivates a lot of mathematical ideas while also acknowledging that sometimes 

338
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,001
the thing that seems like very clever, pure math that you're bringing in to address a 

339
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:16,662
problem just isn't actually very effective and that what's more important when you're 

340
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:21,540
applying math to the world is to find the right framing of the problem in the first place.

341
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,763
And this is just a lesson I think is worth emphasizing a little bit more in math, 

342
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:29,278
that rather than trying to find a better solution to a particular problem, 

343
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:33,308
you want to instead ask whether the problem that you're solving is actually the right 

344
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,340
problem to be solving.

345
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,764
And then last but not least on my list here is another one that I just recognize 

346
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:43,653
the author immediately because it's such a distinctive style that I've seen 

347
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:47,440
in the last two years where the topic matter broadly speaking is infinity.

348
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,320
What exactly does one mean by that?

349
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,215
Like everything on this channel, it is unreasonably beautifully illustrated 

350
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:58,572
and in just 20 minutes, he hits on a lot of the really big important ideas 

351
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:03,220
around what exactly infinity means and how those ideas all relate to each other.

352
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,480
So that's a wrap for the ones that I wanted to mention right now and highlight to you.

353
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,410
There are many more, of course, that were submitted and quite a 

354
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,960
few that are worth looking at even if I didn't mention them here.

355
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,947
Again, I do think what makes the judging here at the end so hard is 

356
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:20,216
that what makes something good is usually the sense in which it's 

357
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:23,435
good for a very specific audience and trying to come up with any 

358
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:27,100
notion of how to rank all of these against each other in an objective way.

359
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,820
I mean with different target audiences, it's just an apples to oranges comparison.

360
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,803
With all of that said, the ones selected as winners, 

361
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:40,131
the ones collecting the golden pie creature prizes are the mathematics of string art, 

362
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:44,777
minimal surfaces and the calculus of variations, rethinking the real line, 

363
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:49,920
pixel art anti-aliasing, and from the non-video category how computers use numbers.

364
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,641
So, evidently, shortly after this point in the recording my camera battery died, 

365
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,760
which I guess is almost perfect timing.

366
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,331
I do want to close out though by saying a really big thanks to James 

367
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,345
Schloss for all the organization and helping to make this happen, 

368
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:08,456
to Fred Crozettier for the web development and putting together a new peer review system, 

369
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:11,060
which made everything this year just much, much smoother.

370
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,920
And many, many thanks to the kind folks at Jane Street for providing 

371
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,908
the funding both for prizes associated with the winners and honorable mentions, 

372
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:21,900
and also with other costs associated with running the event.

373
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,784
Also, at the end of August a ton of you participated in the peer review process, 

374
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,040
and I really just want to say thank you for donating your time to doing that.

375
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,250
And then of course, thank you to everybody who 

376
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,260
made some kind of math explainer for the event.

377
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,140
There are many really good ones that I didn't have the time to talk about in this video.

378
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,908
In the description you'll find a link to a playlist for all the video entries, 

379
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:44,120
and then on the website we'll include a list of all the non-video entries.

380
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,480
So do check them out!

381
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,769
I can almost guarantee that if you scroll through and see what you're interested in, 

382
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,240
you'll find some hidden gems in there.
