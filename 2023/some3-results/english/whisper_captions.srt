00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
This year we ran the third Summer of Math Exposition, which is a contest aimed at encouraging

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,040
more people to put up math explainers online, in whatever way they dream of doing that.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,340
A lot of them are videos, not all of them are videos.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,880
Every year we select some winners, but I say at every time the contest is not actually

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,040
about the winners, success looks like getting more good explanations online.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,040
Now last year in the winner announcement video I talked all about the specific criteria I

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,860
try to think about.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,380
I won't necessarily repeat that here, you can watch that one for all that.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,580
Instead, I thought I'd just go down 25 different entries and say a couple of words on what

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,660
I like about each one.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,880
Before I dive in, I gotta be honest, I found it especially hard this year to actually make

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,040
the decisions for what constitutes an honorable mention, what constitutes a winner.

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,860
And to be clear, I'm not the only one making decisions here, we have a whole bunch of guest

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,760
judges who helped, I'm really just assembling my own feedback on everyone else's.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,580
But nevertheless, at some point you have to make a call that says this one is a winner,

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,420
or this one is an honorable mention.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,920
And I think I realized one of the reasons it was so hard is I don't think there's such

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,680
a thing as a generally good math explainer for a general audience.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,400
I think there's such a thing as a pretty good video for a general audience, and I think

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
there's such a thing as great videos for very specific audiences.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,980
And in some ways it's that second category that is where the internet really shines,

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,900
where you have something that maybe isn't perfectly tailored for everyone because it

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,380
can't be, but for that particular audience that it's great for, it's kind of the best

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,600
thing you could have asked for.

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,500
And I'll actually give one example.

26
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,540
So one of the entries that I want to showcase for you is called Pixel Art Anti-Aliasing.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,340
It's all about the task of taking a piece of two-dimensional, really low resolution

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,020
pixel art, but displaying it in a three-dimensional, potentially high resolution environment.

29
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,800
I found it fascinating, and I think anyone who's really into computer graphics, and especially

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,520
anyone who enjoys shader programming, would find this completely fascinating.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,100
For that specific audience, I am very confident in saying, watch it, you'll enjoy it, you're

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,120
going to get something out of it.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,180
Now, this one does a good job of motivating the mathematical ideas that go into it, even

34
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,240
if you aren't necessarily into shader programming.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,980
But if I'm expanding the scope of who I might be recommending this to, to any generally

36
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,860
math-curious internet goer, well, you know, it makes a couple assumptions for things you

37
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,900
might know about that maybe not everyone does.

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,000
And, to be fair, omitting certain fundamentals is the correct choice for the target audience.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,480
Now the next entry, and by the way, I randomly sorted this list of content that I want to

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,340
go through ahead of time, I'll talk about which ones were chosen as winners at the very end.

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,480
This next one is called The Math of Saving the Enola Gay.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,220
So this is talking about the plane which dropped the nuclear bombs in World War II, and the

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,520
author acknowledges that there's some obvious moral questions associated with the mission

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,620
itself, but the focus is on the surprisingly interesting physics question of the best route

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,140
that the plane should take after dropping the weapon to avoid paying potentially calamitous

46
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,040
consequences of the aftershock of the weapon itself.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,860
And what I appreciate is that he really does go into the full detail of the problem itself.

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,800
And this is the kind of video lecture I could imagine as being a really, really excellent

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,760
case study that you could use in a high school physics class or something like that.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,960
It's a worked example that covers a lot of very fundamental ideas that you would need

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,100
for a class like that.

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,560
And whereas often on YouTube it can make sense to kind of skip over some of the heavier details

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,580
and mention that this is best left as an exercise to the viewer or something like that, I really

54
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,460
respect those who actually do step through all of the detail because that most authentically

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,760
reflects what the feeling of doing math is and the amount of time that it can take.

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,340
So it's definitely something to watch when you're in the mood for details, but when you

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,400
are, it's excellent.

58
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,720
Next up is Making a Pitch Shifter.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,880
And so this is the technology that allows you to auto-tune and things like that.

60
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,200
And also it's an equivalent problem to how you speed up or slow down audio without changing

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,020
the pitch of it.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,920
For example, I imagine a lot of you are watching this video at 1.5x or 2x, and if you step

63
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,500
back and think about what's required to make that work, it's actually a very interesting

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,980
question.

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,100
And this video goes through a lot of the different ways that you might think about it, some of

66
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,560
the initial approaches, quirks associated with those.

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
It shows the code that he's using along the way.

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,740
It's a great practical problem, and who doesn't love a little more forte in their lives?

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,260
Next up we have a non-video entry.

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,840
This one is Cayley Graphs and Pretty Things.

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,280
And this is another example where, for the right audience, this is an excellent piece

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,880
of content.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,560
And in this case, I think that audience would be students in group theory.

74
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,720
And in particular, I think what it does an excellent job describing is the semi-direct

75
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,300
product.

76
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,580
So it describes a lot of other things, but it builds up to this, which is a very specific

77
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,000
and kind of niche thing that a group theory student might come across, might be a little

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,020
bit confusing in the book.

79
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,400
And the way that everything is explained here gives a really satisfying mental image that

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,340
you can hold in your head for that, which is great.

81
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,240
Ah, okay, the next one is the longest increasing subsequence.

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,640
And you know, I talk about one of the things I'm looking for as being memorable pieces

83
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,280
of content.

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,580
And this channel definitely satisfies that, because for the last three years, I remember

85
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,920
the entries that they put in.

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,540
They have a very particular style, a very distinctively clear way of talking about what

87
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,600
would usually be rather technical topics.

88
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,380
And here, I'm envisioning the target audience as probably being the same kind of people

89
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,460
who would attend like a seminar in a math department, curious undergrads or some of

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,800
the grad students in the department.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,400
Because it describes a problem which, to be perfectly fair, you might not care about if

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,000
you're not already super into math.

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,740
It's talking about if you have a random permutation, what might you expect the longest increasing

94
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,720
subsequence in that permutation to be?

95
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
So a very natural but very pure question.

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,660
And the tactics brought to studying this are surprising, but really well motivated in the

97
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,720
context of the video, and I think just really beautiful to think about.

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,440
Next up, we've got another non-video entry, the Matrix Arcade.

99
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,740
And this one, I think I remember in the peer review, might have gotten marked down a little

100
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,940
bit more than some of the others.

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,220
And I'm guessing it's because one of the things we mentioned looking for in any given content

102
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,180
piece is novelty.

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,740
And in terms of topic matter, this one covers a lot of the same things as the Essence of

104
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,860
Linear Algebra series that I made way back when.

105
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,080
But I do actually think this one is worth highlighting because even if there's overlap

106
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,500
in the subject matter, I think presenting it in this mode in an interactive way where

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,300
at the end you offer a playground that someone can go through, and along the way each idea

108
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,300
is really well illustrated on the main screen and really well described in the text on the

109
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,520
right.

110
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,180
That adds something that I wanted to see added to the space for a long time, and I could

111
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,320
absolutely see recommending this to teachers of linear algebra.

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
It's a great link that you can send to someone.

113
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,820
Next in my randomly sorted list of featured content is a video called Watching Neural

114
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,600
Networks Learn.

115
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,560
And on the one hand, it's very beautiful.

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,720
A lot of the imagery comes from a certain way to visualize the gradient descent process

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,480
or what the neural network can do during that process.

118
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,160
But the thing that really sold this for me was not so much the nice visuals, but there's

119
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,160
a really thought-provoking discussion in here on the choices that you can make as you set

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,740
up the network and what different features you can use.

121
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,720
And in the context of learning a function that describes a two-dimensional image, why

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,140
Fourier series in particular end up giving dramatically better results.

123
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,700
And I had never thought about this particular combination of ideas before, and I thought

124
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,880
it was just really fascinating.

125
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,140
Next up we've got an article, Functions are Vectors.

126
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,700
This is one of those topics that's just very important.

127
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,420
There's a time in your life before you think about functions as vectors, and there's a

128
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,000
time in your life after you think about functions as vectors.

129
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,840
And this article was just very thorough and well explained, and I think it's one of the

130
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
best resources out there to transition someone between those two states.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,980
Next up we've got The Art of Linear Programming.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,280
And this addresses a class of problems that come up in computer science and the algorithmic

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,220
way of thinking about a good way to solve them.

134
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,000
And the approach that the author takes, which I always think is a very good one in any kind

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,780
of education, is to just start with one of the most simple, non-trivial examples that

136
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,800
you can have, and really just working through what everything looks like in that context,

137
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,500
as he then goes on to describe the more general, or sometimes more constrained situations where

138
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,940
those similar ideas can apply.

139
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,320
It's well illustrated, the ideas along the way are well motivated, so just a bang up

140
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,080
job all around.

141
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,300
This next one is actually a little different.

142
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,280
It's called The Mosaic Problem, How and Why to Do Math for Fun.

143
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,840
So the author is describing a very specific question that they were once contemplating.

144
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,480
You know, I think a criticism that you could lay is that there's not a lot of motivation

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,840
for why you might care about the problem, but that's not actually what the video is

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,300
about.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,620
He's really just using this as an example of what he calls a backburner problem, and

148
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,280
this is an idea that I think is very much worth getting into the minds of more math

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,300
students out there.

150
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,260
Essentially it's that if you have some sort of problem that you care about and you think

151
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,560
about, even if no one else does, as long as it sprouts out your own curiosity, and when

152
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,700
you go into new math classes, you have that as a problem that you can kind of turn to

153
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,320
every now and then, it offers a fertile ground for adding context to a lot of math out there

154
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,400
which is sometimes so desperately lacking a good context that motivates the students.

155
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,140
So for his particular question, this mosaic problem, he talks about how it made relevant

156
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,780
certain ideas like generating functions and principles of inclusion and exclusion.

157
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,900
And his broader point is not that this particular problem is the most important in the world,

158
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,520
but that having a backburner problem of some kind is actually one of the best ways to stay

159
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
engaged with math.

160
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,220
And that I would definitely agree with.

161
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,280
And I guess on the topic of problems which probably don't really matter, but are fun

162
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,900
to think about and end up being a path to some actually interesting math, the next one,

163
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,440
affording a planet with geometry, is I think the only claymation entry that I saw this

164
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,900
year used to good effect in describing a certain optimization problem framed in the context

165
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,720
of deciding what shape you want to turn your planet into if you want to experience a certain

166
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,640
amount of gravity but not use too much mass to do it.

167
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,420
It's well explained.

168
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,080
If you're into that kind of problem, definitely check it out.

169
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,080
Next up we've got when can't math be generalized, the limits of analytic continuation.

170
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,740
And thinking in terms of target audiences, anyone who's taking a complex analysis class,

171
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,660
this is outstanding, perfect for them.

172
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,140
Anyone who might have a complex analysis class in their future, I think this does a good

173
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,860
job setting up some of the ideas that you run across in that.

174
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,640
It's not talking about generalizing math in the sense of applying it to a general set

175
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,240
of circumstances, but in a setting where sometimes you can take a function defined on one domain

176
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
and extend that definition beyond it.

177
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,420
There are circumstances where you actually can't do that.

178
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,140
And he offers a really clear description of what exactly we mean by extending in this

179
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,680
context and then an example where you can't do that that seems like it's sort of dropped

180
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,040
in from out of the blue, but it gives a really satisfying reason for why this example would

181
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,320
have the properties that it does with some suggestion for how you might have come up

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,800
with that.

183
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,060
And the next up is just a very cute example of an argument in geometry.

184
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,880
Some of you might have thought about this before, but if you translate something and

185
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,620
then rotate it, or maybe you rotate and then translate, it's always possible to express

186
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,840
the composite motion there as some kind of rotation about some point.

187
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,520
And of course there's a slight caveat there where if you just translate it but rotate

188
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,720
it at zero degrees, that's not the same as a rotation.

189
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,520
And this video offers just a really well-illustrated proof of why that's the case.

190
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,800
And I think what stuck out to me is the way that the second half of the proof was framed

191
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,840
in terms of this kind of game that you're playing with a certain demon, which takes

192
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,680
what otherwise is maybe a little bit of a confusing set of logical steps that leads

193
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,700
to a contradiction, and instead just makes it a little easier to hold onto while you're

194
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,680
following all of the reasoning.

195
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,380
So I appreciated that.

196
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,760
Ah, so the next one, rethinking the real line.

197
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,860
I really liked this one, and it stood out from many others, for one thing just because

198
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,160
it felt very natural, like the presentation didn't feel like it was scripted or over-edited

199
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,740
in any way, but what really shone is the subject matter.

200
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,580
And again, I think the sense in which it's great is for a particular target audience.

201
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,120
So in this case, if you've ever thought about visualizing rational numbers or rational approximations

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,780
of irrational numbers, it offers just a really dense set of very nice ideas for how to think

203
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,400
about these topics, and they're all connected with each other very nicely, and I for one

204
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,320
felt like I came out of it armed with a few more mental constructs for how to think about

205
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,380
a few of these ideas, which is of course just such a nice feeling.

206
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,480
Alright, next we've got, how did the ancient Egyptians find this volume without algebra?

207
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,460
So this is a question which is interesting in terms of the history of math, or what you

208
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,720
can do without certain ideas that we take for granted.

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,700
So the problem at hand is how you find the volume of essentially a pyramid where you

210
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
cut off the top of it.

211
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,500
The author talks about how the Egyptians had this formula for it, which is of course not

212
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,980
written algebraically, people didn't think algebraically back then, but he addresses

213
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,520
how it's actually very surprising to get to that formula if you don't think algebraically,

214
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,400
and so tries to address the problem of how might you find this idea as an algorithm for

215
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,220
finding the volume not expressed as a formula without being able to manipulate the formulas

216
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,980
that you or I would naturally manipulate to land on that idea.

217
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,740
This next one I think has one of the best hooks of any of the ones that I've seen before.

218
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,400
So he essentially asks if you're swinging a ball on a rope above your head, and then

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,500
at some point you release the rope, you let go of the rope, what happens to the ball with

220
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,820
the three possibilities that it continues on the circular path, that it continues on

221
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,340
the straight line path tangent to the circle, or it goes on the straight path away from

222
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,800
the circle.

223
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,820
And I guess I'll just say it's not the answer that most people say it is, and he does I

224
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,040
think a really good job laying out the intuition for why that's not the case, and then demonstrating

225
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,060
it experimentally.

226
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,160
Also on the more physics-oriented side of things, we have the math of bubbles, minimal

227
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,280
surfaces and the calculus of variations.

228
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,460
So again, there's a great hook here, where the problem at hand is to understand the shape

229
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,760
of the surface that you get if you take two cylindrical boundaries and then form a bubble

230
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,740
in between them, where the relevant physics at play is that bubbles try to have the minimal

231
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,980
surface area that they can, subject to some kind of boundary conditions.

232
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,100
The way to solve this problem is to bring in something known as the calculus of variations.

233
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,720
It's very important in other contexts, for example if any of you have ever heard of Lagrangian

234
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,380
mechanics, and the author here describes the general framework used for not just this problem

235
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,520
but a wide category of problems, and works through it for this particular case.

236
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,200
Again, it's one of those where to get the most out of it, you've got to be in the mood

237
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,100
for some details, and in this one he does leave a lot of room to kind of pause and think

238
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,220
through things where if certain steps are something you might have thought about before,

239
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,100
you don't have to linger on it too much, but definitely if it's the first time you're going

240
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,100
through any calculus of variation example, it is something you kind of need to stop and

241
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,980
digest for a bit, and he leaves the room for that, which is nice.

242
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,900
Next up is another non-video entry, which I think is a really just perfect example for

243
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,960
any Calculus 2 class out there, so any teachers looking to pull in something, I think this

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,060
is a really great resource.

245
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,740
The question is very simply, how do computers calculate logarithms?

246
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,480
What happens when you're clicking that button?

247
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,040
He goes into things like Taylor series, but then perhaps more importantly, why the simple

248
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,820
naive Taylor series approach here doesn't necessarily get you something as good as you

249
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,360
might want.

250
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,660
That last step is really well-motivated, really well-described, so if you're curious, go

251
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,180
take a look.

252
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Next on the docket we have, what happens if you add fractions incorrectly?

253
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,300
So if you ask elementary schoolers to add fractions together, there's kind of this instinct

254
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,620
to just add the numerators and add the denominators.

255
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,200
If that's happening, it's probably a sign that the student doesn't appreciate what's

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,280
actually being represented, or that the rules of math actually have a reason for them, and

257
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,660
you need to think through those reasons.

258
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,180
But the funny thing is, that operation, which is not adding fractions, is actually the start

259
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,740
of a surprisingly far-ranging set of ideas in other parts of math.

260
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,260
It has a special name, it's known as the mediant, and the author essentially walks through this

261
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,920
pretty wide space of different things that this seemingly arbitrary operation can lead

262
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,540
you to.

263
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,340
It's actually pretty connected with the one we were talking about a couple minutes

264
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,100
ago on re-imagining the reals, things like rational approximations.

265
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,900
It also talks about Dirichlet's theorem.

266
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,080
Forward circles are in there, who doesn't love a good forward circle?

267
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,380
So if you're curious about the meandering set of ideas that you can be led to here,

268
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,780
definitely do take a look.

269
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,880
Next we've got, can you guess a shape from its shadows?

270
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,760
So maybe you've thought about this kind of problem before, if you take a 3D shape and

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,980
you look at its shadow from one direction, shadow from another, and then shadow from

272
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,460
a third, can you reconstruct what that shape is?

273
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,860
And he mentions a seemingly obvious example, where all three of those shadows are squares,

274
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,940
so you think the answer is a cube, but it's actually dramatically more interesting than

275
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,100
a cube, and he talks about the set of shapes that you can get from this.

276
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,220
Ah, okay, so the next one, stylistically, is one of the most distinct of all of them,

277
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,600
which I always appreciate, especially if I'm going through hundreds of different explainers

278
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
and trying to make a decision.

279
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,060
At first when I was watching this, I was like, wait, what's going on here?

280
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,720
Why is he just kind of like walking around in a bunch of different places?

281
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,660
But he has this really kind of calming way of incorporating a bunch of different environments

282
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,740
and nature into these otherwise sometimes pretty technical descriptions of what he's

283
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,340
talking about.

284
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,100
And the topic matter, broadly speaking, is fixed point theorems.

285
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,980
So this is one where I can imagine the target audience being like a math major or someone

286
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,140
who has reason to care about fixed point theorems.

287
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,160
And as it goes on, he does get into some real depth of it.

288
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,360
We're closing in now towards the end of my randomly sorted list of featured videos.

289
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,620
I guess the next one is not actually a video.

290
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,380
I keep saying video is a generic stand-in for content.

291
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,060
But the next one is an article describing how computers represent numbers, in particular

292
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,000
floating point numbers.

293
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,900
And I've seen other explainers for floating point representations out there before, but

294
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,840
I think this is the best one that I've seen.

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,680
And I really appreciate the approach that he takes, which is to have you imagine that

296
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,660
you want to represent them and go through a refined set of ideas where each one is not

297
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,420
quite what the final answer ends up being, but motivates the next step in a nice way.

298
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,260
This genre of discovery fiction, I think, works especially well when you have topics

299
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,940
that seem like they have a lot of arbitrary or unexpected choices along the way.

300
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,500
It's just really well explained.

301
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,360
I liked it a lot.

302
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
All right, next on the list, we've got mathematical magic mirror ball.

303
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,920
Say that five times fast.

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,420
Essentially describing how if you take a picture of a spherical mirror, you can use that image

305
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,700
to reconstruct a 360 degree view of the room all around it.

306
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,800
And he described how that works, what it's used for, what the trade-offs are, all around

307
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,520
just a great application of a pretty surprising phenomenon.

308
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,920
This penultimate one on my list is just actually kind of amazing.

309
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,620
The person built this machine, which will weave a string along a whole bunch of pegs

310
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,720
around a circle, such that as those strings intersect very densely at some points to make

311
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,300
it dark and very sparsely at others to make it light, you can reconstruct an image.

312
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,820
That's just amazing that such a thing is possible.

313
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,660
And the author describes the process for how this was made and the various ideas that he

314
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,380
tried, the reasons that they didn't work.

315
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,460
It both motivates a lot of mathematical ideas while also acknowledging that sometimes the

316
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,560
thing that seems like very clever, pure math that you're bringing in to address a problem

317
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,860
just isn't actually very effective and that what's more important when you're applying

318
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,540
math to the world is to find the right framing of the problem in the first place.

319
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,420
And this is just a lesson I think is worth emphasizing a little bit more in math, that

320
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,800
rather than trying to find a better solution to a particular problem, you want to instead

321
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,340
ask whether the problem that you're solving is actually the right problem to be solving.

322
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,760
And then last but not least on my list here is another one that I just recognize the author

323
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,700
immediately because it's such a distinctive style that I've seen in the last two years

324
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,440
where the topic matter broadly speaking is infinity.

325
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,320
What exactly does one mean by that?

326
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,660
Like everything on this channel, it is unreasonably beautifully illustrated and in just 20 minutes,

327
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,360
he hits on a lot of the really big important ideas around what exactly infinity means and

328
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,220
how those ideas all relate to each other.

329
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,480
So that's a wrap for the ones that I wanted to mention right now and highlight to you.

330
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,380
There are many more, of course, that were submitted and quite a few that are worth looking

331
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,960
at even if I didn't mention them here.

332
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,620
Again, I do think what makes the judging here at the end so hard is that what makes something

333
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,720
good is usually the sense in which it's good for a very specific audience and trying to

334
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,660
come up with any notion of how to rank all of these against each other in an objective

335
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,100
way.

336
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,820
I mean with different target audiences, it's just an apples to oranges comparison.

337
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,000
With all of that said, the ones selected as winners, the ones collecting the golden pie

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,540
creature prizes are the mathematics of string art, minimal surfaces and the calculus of

339
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,720
variations, rethinking the real line, pixel art anti-aliasing, and from the non-video

340
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,920
category how computers use numbers.

341
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,980
So, evidently, shortly after this point in the recording my camera battery died, which

342
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,760
I guess is almost perfect timing.

343
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,860
I do want to close out though by saying a really big thanks to James Schloss for all

344
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,600
the organization and helping to make this happen, to Fred Crozettier for the web development

345
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,400
and putting together a new peer review system, which made everything this year just much,

346
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,060
much smoother.

347
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,940
And many, many thanks to the kind folks at Jane Street for providing the funding both

348
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,460
for prizes associated with the winners and honorable mentions, and also with other costs

349
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,900
associated with running the event.

350
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,660
Also, at the end of August a ton of you participated in the peer review process, and I really just

351
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,040
want to say thank you for donating your time to doing that.

352
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,000
And then of course, thank you to everybody who made some kind of math explainer for the

353
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,260
event.

354
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,140
There are many really good ones that I didn't have the time to talk about in this video.

355
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,280
In the description you'll find a link to a playlist for all the video entries, and

356
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,120
then on the website we'll include a list of all the non-video entries.

357
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,480
So do check them out!

358
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,760
I can almost guarantee that if you scroll through and see what you're interested in,

359
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,540
you'll find some hidden gems in there.
