1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
In the last video, you and I looked at this demo here, where we shine linearly polarized light through a tube full of sugar water,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,320
and we saw how it rather mysteriously results in these colored diagonal stripes.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,480
There, I walked through the general outline for an explanation, keeping track of what questions still need to be answered.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Namely, why does sugar water twist the polarization direction of light?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Why does that twisting rate depend on the color of the light?

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:35,200
And why, even if you understand that this twist is happening, would you see any evidence of it when viewing the tube from the side, with no additional polarizing filters?

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Here, I'd like to begin with the very fundamental idea of what light is, and show how the answer to these questions can emerge from an extremely minimal set of assumptions.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:57,440
In some sense, the fundamental question of electricity and magnetism is how the position and motion of one charged particle influences that of another.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,560
For example, one of the first things you learn, say in a high school physics class, is that charges with the same sign tend to repel each other.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,240
And the strength of this force depends a lot on the distance between them.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,560
If your charges are close, that repulsive force is very strong, but it decays very rapidly as these particles go away from each other.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,440
Specifically, here's how you might see this written down as an equation, known as Coulomb's law.

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,800
The force is proportional to the charge of both of the particles, where it's common to use the letter q.

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,160
There are some constants in there, which for our purposes we can just think of as one big proportionality constant.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,640
And the important fact is that you've got this 1 divided by r squared term, where r is the distance between them.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,760
So for example, if the distance between them increases by a factor of 3, the force that they're applying to each other goes down by a factor of 9.

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:57,280
Another way you might see a law like this written down is to focus on just one charged particle, and then say for every point in space, if there was a second charge there,

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,440
what force would this first charge be applying to that second one?

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,800
And instead of describing a force per se, you might see this written describing what's known as the electric field,

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,200
which is just a way of saying what force would be applied to a unit charge.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,800
And in this context, the word field means there's a value associated with every single point in space.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,480
So the way I have it written here, it depends on a little vector r, which would be the vector from our charge to a given point in space,

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,560
and the direction of this field at all points is in the same direction as r.

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,640
I bring up Coulomb's law to emphasize that it's not the full story. There are other ways that charges influence each other.

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
For example, here's a phenomenon that this law alone could not explain.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:52,080
If you wiggle one charge up and down, then after a little bit of a delay, a second charge some distance to its right will be induced to wiggle up and down as well.

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,880
We can write down a second law, which you might think of as a correction term to be added to Coulomb's law, that describes what's going on here.

28
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Suppose at some point in time t0 that first charge is accelerating.

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Then I'll let time play forward, but leave on the screen a kind of ghost of that particle indicating where it was and how it was accelerating at this time t0.

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,280
After a certain delay, this causes a force on the second charge, and the equation describing this force looks something like this.

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
So again, it's proportional to the charge of both of the particles,

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,440
and once more a common way to write it involves this pile of constants that you don't really need to worry about.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,200
The important factor I want you to notice is how the force also depends on the distance between the particles,

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,240
but instead of decaying in proportion to r squared, it only decays in proportion to r.

35
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,600
So over long distances, this is the force that dominates, and Coulomb's law is negligible.

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,320
And then finally, it depends on the acceleration of that first particle,

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,160
but it's not the acceleration of that particle at the current time, it's whatever that acceleration was at some time in the past.

38
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,840
How far in the past depends on the distance between the particles and the speed of light, denoted with c.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,680
The way to think about it is that any form of influence can't propagate any faster than this speed, c.

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,320
In fact, a more accurate description of Coulomb's law would also involve a delay term like this.

41
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Again, the intuitive way to read this equation is that wiggling a charge in one location after some delay

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
causes a wiggle to a second charge in another location.

43
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,760
And actually, the way I have it written right now is a little bit wrong.

44
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,640
Instead of the acceleration vector here, I should really be writing something like a perp,

45
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:42,320
indicating the component of that acceleration vector which is perpendicular to the line drawn between the two charges.

46
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
In other words, when you wiggle that first charge, the direction that the second charge wiggles

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,160
is always perpendicular to the line between them, and the amount that it wiggles gets weaker and weaker

48
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
when that line between them is more lined up with the initial acceleration.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
As before, this is something you might see written down in a way that describes

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
a component of the electric field caused by just one charge.

51
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Again, that means what force would be applied to a second charge at all possible different points in space.

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,120
This component of the field is only ever non-zero when our first charge is moving somehow,

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
when it has an acceleration vector on it.

54
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,880
And because of this delay term, the effects on this field tend to radiate away from the charge.

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
This is why I'm writing it down with the subscript rad.

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,080
This is the component of the electric field that will radiate away from a given charge.

57
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,360
For instance, when the charge is oscillating up and down, you get these propagating waves.

58
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,760
And for many of the vector fields I'll be showing, the intensity of the field is illustrated with the

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,400
opacity of each little vector. This radiating influence is light, or more generally,

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,200
electromagnetic radiation, including things like radio waves and x-rays and all that good stuff.

61
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,240
As a side note, you sometimes see this propagation described a very different way

62
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
that puts the fields front and center, using what are known as Maxwell's equations.

63
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,400
For our purposes, I want to focus just on this one law

64
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,840
and show just how far it can take us when it comes to intuitions for light.

65
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,520
For the animations I'm about to show, all I've really done is encoded in this one law,

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,320
which tells us what should this component of the electric field be at every point in space,

67
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,720
as determined by the history of accelerations of a particular charge.

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,760
For example, if I set that charge oscillating up and down in the z direction,

69
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,920
and illustrate this component of the electric field everywhere on the xy-plane,

70
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,680
you see these circular propagations of equal strength in all directions.

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a little easier to think about if we focus on just one axis, like the x-axis.

72
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,880
At first when I made this animation I assumed that there was some kind of bug,

73
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,040
because near the charge it just looks crooked and wrong. But when you think about it,

74
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,200
this is actually what you should expect, because remember, each one of these vectors

75
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,280
is supposed to be perpendicular to the line drawn between that point

76
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,160
and where the charge was at some point in the past.

77
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
At points that are far enough away from the charge, which is where this component of the field

78
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,800
is what dominates anyway, the wiggling in the field is essentially parallel to the wiggling in

79
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
the charge, which is why when we think about light waves, we're safe to think about the wiggling

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,240
direction as being perpendicular to the propagation direction. Like I said, this propagation for just

81
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,200
one charge is equally strong in all of the directions perpendicular to its wiggling,

82
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,120
and really I should emphasize that the propagation does have a lot of strength in the field.

83
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
It's maybe a little busy to try to illustrate the full three-dimensional vector field on screen

84
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,200
like this, so it's clarifying if we just focus on, say, the x-z plane. Notice how the waves here

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,480
are strongest in the x direction, but it still does propagate in all other directions, it's just

86
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,520
that that propagation gets weaker in directions that are more aligned with the original wiggling.

87
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,120
At the extreme, the only thing that's more important is the direction that the wave is

88
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,280
going to move in the direction that it's going to move in. So if we're going to look at the

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,920
wiggling at the extreme, the only place where there's no propagation is in the z-axis.

90
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,080
Because our law has this 1 divided by r in it, the strength of the wave caused by just one particle

91
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,080
does decay as you go farther away, in proportion to 1 over r. But notice what happens if I take a

92
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,840
whole row of charges, say oriented along the y-axis, and I have them all start wiggling up and down in

93
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,200
z-direction, and I illustrate the combined effects that all of them have on this component

94
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,160
of the electric field. The effects of all these charges interfere deconstructively along the y

95
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,320
direction, but they interfere constructively along the x-direction. This is what it looks like for a

96
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,920
beam of light to be concentrated along just one dimension. So if you were to focus on the field

97
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,400
just along the x-axis, instead of decaying in proportion to 1 over r, this combined effect

98
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,040
decays much more gently. In the extreme, you can get something arbitrarily close to those pure sine

99
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,160
wave propagations we were illustrating earlier, if at some distance away you have a large number

100
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,560
of charges oscillating in sync with each other like this. One thing that's worth emphasizing

101
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,120
when you see light illustrated with a sine wave like this is that even though that wave is being

102
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,120
drawn in two or three dimensions, it's only describing the electric field along a one-dimensional

103
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,880
line, namely the base of all those vectors. It's just that to draw the vectors you have to venture

104
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,480
off of that line. Great, so one of the last important things to highlight before we get back to the

105
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,320
sugar water is polarization. In everything I've been showing, the driving charge is just oscillating

106
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,320
along a single direction, like the z-axis, and this causes linearly polarized light. But it doesn't have

107
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,600
to happen like that. For example, if I set the charge rotating in a little circle along the y-z

108
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,200
plane, meaning its acceleration vector is also rotating in a little circle, notice what the field

109
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,000
looks like. This is known, aptly enough, as circularly polarized light. Honestly, it's easiest to think

110
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,520
about for just one point of the electric field. What it means for light to be circularly polarized

111
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,520
is that at that point, the electric field vector is just rotating in a circle. People often find

112
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,480
circular polarization a little confusing, and I suspect part of the reason for that is that it's

113
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,280
hard to illustrate with a static diagram, but also it's a little confusing when you try to think about

114
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,800
the full electric field. For example, here's what the field looks like on the xy plane when I set

115
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,280
that little charge rotating in a circle. It's certainly very beautiful, I could look at this all

116
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,640
day, but you can understand why it might feel a little confusing. The very last thing I'll mention

117
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,120
is that while everything here is a classical description of light, the important points still

118
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,760
hold up in quantum mechanics. You still have propagating waves, there's still polarization

119
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,320
that can be either linear or circular. The main difference with quantum mechanics is that the

120
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,600
energy in this wave doesn't scale up and down continuously like you might expect, it comes in

121
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,560
discrete little steps. I have another video that goes into more detail, but for our purposes,

122
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,600
thinking about it classically is fine. Part of the reason I wanted to go through that is because

123
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
frankly it's just very fun to animate and I like an excuse for a fundamental lesson.

124
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,560
But now let's turn back to our demo and see how we can build up an intuition for some of our key

125
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,920
questions, starting from this very basic premise that shaking a charge in one location causes a

126
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
shake to another charge a little bit later. And let's start by actually skipping ahead

127
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,640
to question number three, why do we see the diagonal stripes?

128
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:38,560
To think about this, you need to imagine an observer to the side of the tube, and then for

129
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,400
a particular pure color, say red, if the observer looks in the tube and sees that color, it's

130
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,800
because light of that color has bounced off something at that point in the tube and then

131
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,360
propagated towards the eye of the observer. Sometimes when people talk about light bouncing

132
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,640
off of things, the implied mental image is something like a projectile ricocheting off

133
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,360
of some object heading off in some random direction. But the better mental image to

134
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,080
hold in your mind is that when the propagating light waves caused by some wiggling charge

135
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,440
reach some second charge causing it to wiggle, that secondary wiggle results in its own propagation.

136
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,800
And for the animation on screen, that propagation goes back to the first charge, which itself causes

137
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,680
a propagation towards the second, and this is what it looks like in a very simplified situation

138
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,040
for light to bounce back and forth between two charges. If you have some concentrated beam of

139
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,160
polarized light interacting with some charge, causing it to wiggle up and down, then these

140
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,600
resulting second order propagations are most strong in the directions perpendicular to the

141
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,320
direction of polarization. In some sense you could think of light as bouncing off of that charge,

142
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,000
but the important point is that it doesn't bounce in all directions equally,

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,040
it's strongest perpendicular to the wiggle direction, but gets weaker in all of the other directions.

144
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,600
So think about our setup, and for a particular frequency of light, how likely it is that an

145
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,600
observer looking at a particular point in the tube will see that light. Again, the key phenomenon with

146
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,400
sugar water, which we have yet to explain, is that the polarization direction is slowly getting

147
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,160
twisted as it goes down the tube. So suppose the observer was looking at a point like this one,

148
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,480
where the polarization direction happens to be straight up and down. Then the second order

149
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,760
propagations resulting from wiggling charges at that point are most strong along the plane where

150
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,080
the observer is, so the amount of red that they see at that point would look stronger.

151
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,440
By contrast, if they were looking at a different point in the tube like this one, where the wiggling

152
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
direction is closer to being parallel to the line of sight, then the direction where the scattering

153
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,160
is strongest is not at all aligned with the observer, and the amount of red they see is only

154
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,400
going to be very weak. And looking at our actual physical setup, if we first pass the light through

155
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,880
a filter showing only the red, we see exactly this effect in action. As you scan your eyes along the

156
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,120
tube, the intensity of red that you see goes from being high to being low, where it's almost black,

157
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,680
back to being high again. As an analogy, imagine there was a ribbon going down the tube always

158
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,800
aligned with the polarization direction for this color. Then putting yourself in the shoes of the

159
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,200
observer, when you look at points where the ribbon appears very thin, you're going to see very little

160
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,840
red light, whereas if you scan your eyes over to points where the ribbon appears thicker, you're

161
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,320
going to see more red light. One thing that's nice about this is that if we try it for various

162
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,120
different colors, you can actually see how the twisting rates are different for each one of the

163
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,920
colors. Notice with red light, the distance between where it appears brightest and where it appears

164
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,520
darkest is relatively long, whereas if you look down the colors of the rainbow, that distance

165
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,080
between the brightest point and the darkest point gets lower and lower. So what you're seeing in

166
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,160
effect is how red light twists slowly, whereas light waves with higher frequencies get twisted

167
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,640
more aggressively. But still, you might wonder why the boundaries between light and dark points

168
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,000
appear diagonal. Why is it that in addition to having variation as you scan your eyes from left

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,080
to right, there's also variation as you scan your eyes from the top of the tube to the bottom? This

170
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,560
has less to do with what's going on in the tube and more to do with a matter of perspective.

171
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,440
Take a moment to think about many different parallel beams of light ranging from the top

172
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,000
of the tube to the bottom. At the beginning, all of these light waves are wiggling up and down,

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,560
and as you pass through the tube and the effects of the sugar water somehow twists these directions,

174
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,800
because they're all passing through the same amount of sugar, they're getting twisted by the

175
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,760
same amounts. So at all points, the polarization of these waves are parallel to each other.

176
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,440
If you're the observer and you look at the topmost point here, its wiggling direction is essentially

177
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,840
parallel to the line of sight, so the light scattering from that point is basically not

178
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,720
going to reach your eyes at all. It should appear black. But if you scan your eyes down the tube,

179
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,800
the angle between the line of sight and the wiggling direction changes, and so there will

180
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,000
be at least some component of red light scattering towards the eye. So as you scan your eyes from top

181
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,960
to bottom, the amount of a particular color you see might vary, say from dark to light.

182
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,760
The full demo that has white light is basically a combination of all these pure color patterns

183
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,400
that go from light to dark to light with diagonal boundaries between the intense points and the weak

184
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,920
points, hence why you see diagonal boundaries between the colors inside the tube. And now at

185
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,960
last let's turn to the heart of the matter and try to explain why interactions with sugar would

186
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,720
make light twist like this in the first place. It's related to the idea that light seems to slow down

187
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,360
as it passes through a given medium. For example, if you look at the crests of a light wave as it

188
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,840
goes into water, the crests through the water are traveling about 1.33 times slower than the crests

189
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,880
of that wave would travel in a vacuum. This number is what's called the index of refraction for water.

190
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,560
In a bit what I'd like to show is how this index of refraction can be explained by analyzing how

191
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,520
the initial light wave shakes all the charges in the material and how the resulting second

192
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,360
order propagations superimpose with that original light wave. For right now I'll just say that the

193
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,880
interactions with each layer of the material ends up having the effect of slightly shifting back

194
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
the phase of the wave, and on the whole this gives the overall appearance that that wave moves slower

195
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,760
as it passes through the material. Skipping ahead to what's going on with sugar, the relevant

196
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,120
property of sucrose here is that it's what's called a chiral molecule, meaning it's fundamentally

197
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,840
different from its mirror image. You could never reorient it in space to become identical to its

198
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,440
mirror image. It's like a left hand or a right hand. Or another much simpler example of a chiral

199
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,360
shape is a spiral. If I take this right-handed spiral, then its mirror image is a left-handed

200
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,840
spiral, and no matter how you try to rotate and reorient that first one, it'll never become

201
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:07,120
identical to the second. What's going on then is that the presence of a chiral molecule in the

202
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,560
water like this introduces an asymmetry when it comes to interactions with light, specifically

203
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,800
circularly polarized light. It turns out that the amount this chiral molecule slows down, say,

204
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,600
left-handed circularly polarized light is different from the amount that it slows down

205
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,480
right-handed circularly polarized light. Effectively, there's not one index of refraction,

206
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,400
but two. Now you might say that seems irrelevant to our setup, since we are very deliberately

207
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,840
shining in linearly polarized light, there is no circularly polarized light. But actually,

208
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,480
there's a sense in which linearly polarized light is equal parts left-handed and right-handed

209
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,640
circularly polarized light. Here, focus your attention on just one vector in this wave,

210
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
wiggling straight up and down, which is to say polarized in the z direction.

211
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,200
Notice how it's possible to express this vector as a sum of two rotating vectors,

212
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,680
one of them rotating at a constant rate counterclockwise, and the other one rotating

213
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,680
clockwise. Adding them together tip to tail results in a vector oscillating on a line.

214
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,320
In this case, it's a vertical line, but that direction can change based on the phase of the

215
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,880
two vectors we're adding together. Here, let me throw up a couple labels to keep track of how

216
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,600
much each one of those two vectors has rotated in total, and then every now and then I'm going to

217
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,080
slow down that first vector a little bit, and I want you to notice what happens to their sum.

218
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,120
Well, every time I slow it down, effectively knocking back its phase a little bit,

219
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,280
it causes the linearly wiggling sum to wiggle in a slightly different direction.

220
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,840
So if the circularly polarized light wave represented by that left vector gets slowed

221
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,640
down a little bit every time it runs across a sugar molecule, or at least slowed down more than

222
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,080
its oppositely rotating counterpart would, the effect on the sum is to slowly rotate the direction

223
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,120
of linear polarization. And hence, as you look at slices further and further down the tube,

224
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,520
the polarization direction does indeed get twisted the way we were describing earlier,

225
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,520
representing how the composite effects with many many many different sugar molecules

226
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,120
are slightly different for left-handed light than they are for right-handed light.

227
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,520
As a nice way to test whether you understood everything up to this point,

228
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,880
see if just by looking at the direction of the diagonal slices on our tube, you can deduce which

229
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,960
kind of light the sugar is slowing down more, left-handed light or right-handed light.

230
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,960
I'll call this a partial answer to our question number one, because it still leaves us wondering

231
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,280
why there's an index of refraction in the first place, and how exactly it might depend on the

232
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,320
polarization of the light, not just the material it's passing through. Also, like I said at the

233
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,080
start, a robust enough intuition here should also answer for us why the strength of this effect

234
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,400
would depend on the frequency of the light. At this point I think we've covered quite enough

235
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,120
for one video, so I'll pull out a discussion covering the origins of the index of refraction

236
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,280
to a separate video.
