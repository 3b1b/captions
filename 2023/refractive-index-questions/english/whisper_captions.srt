1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
The last video I put out was about the index of refraction.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,260
It talked about why light slows down when it passes through a medium,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,220
and in particular, why the rate of slowdown would depend on color.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,960
It turns out people have a lot of questions about the index of refraction,

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,960
and in this supplemental video I wanted to take a chance to answer a couple of them.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,880
For example, how is it possible for this index to be lower than one,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,720
which seems to imply that light would travel faster than the speed of light through some materials.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,020
To kick things off though, I want to take a question that does not require too much background,

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,680
asked by Kevin O'Toole, which is why exactly light slowing down

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,480
would imply that it bends as it enters a medium.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,900
There's a common analogy, which is to think of something like a car or a tank,

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,600
where it turns a little bit while one side of it slows down before the other,

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,860
and although it's a very visceral and memorable analogy,

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,680
it's not like light has wheels, and it also tells you nothing about how to be more quantitative.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,860
Derive the formula describing exactly how much light bends.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,900
Here's a better way to think about it.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,960
If you have some light wave shining into a material like glass,

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,240
if it slows down, notice how that means that it gets kind of scrunched up.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,960
If its wavelength in a vacuum was some number lambda,

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,240
then the wavelength inside this material, where it's gotten slowed down, is something smaller than that.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,900
Here I am drawing the wave only on a one-dimensional line,

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,780
but we need to understand it in at least two dimensions,

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,720
where every point on this plane, for example,

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,180
is associated with a little vector in the electric field oscillating up and down.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,800
This particular animation is a little bit messy and hard to follow,

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,780
so it might be clearer if instead we simply color every point of the plane,

27
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,520
such that those points are white near the crests of the wave, and then black away from the crests.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,580
You can still clearly see the wavelength as the distance between these crests.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,280
It's exactly what we were looking at before, just drawn in a different way,

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,280
and in particular notice how they're scrunched up inside the glass.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
If that glass were positioned at an angle,

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,020
think about what happens to each one of those wave crests.

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,700
As it hits the glass, the lower parts slow down before the top parts,

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,940
causing it to get sort of smeared out.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,460
It reminds me a little of the rolling shutter effect,

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,780
and overall the wave crest ends up at a different angle.

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,960
When you take into account the fact that for a beam of light,

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,820
the beam is always perpendicular to those wave crests,

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,700
this means your light has to turn,

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,480
and moreover you can calculate exactly how much it needs to turn.

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,860
Think about all those waves in the vacuum, with some kind of wavelength lambda-1

42
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,120
sitting between them, and focus on all the points where those crests intersect

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,980
with the boundary between the vacuum and the glass.

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,040
But then consider those wave crests inside the glass.

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,080
If it was the case that no bending happened, then because the wavelength is smaller in there,

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,760
when you look at all those intersection points, they would have to be closer together.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,360
But of course that can't happen, whether you're looking at it from one side,

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,700
or looking at it from the other, those intersection points are all the same.

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,660
So the only way this can work is if those wave crests inside the glass

50
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,620
were oriented at a different angle.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,120
You might mentally imagine turning them with a little knob to find the sweet spot angle

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,340
where all those intersection points line up.

53
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,940
And for those of you into exercises, you could take a moment to try to write down

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,960
the specific equation telling you how to relate the wavelengths inside and outside the glass

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,700
with the angles between those wave crests and the boundary itself.

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,840
If you do this, what you write down is effectively the same thing as Snell's law,

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,220
you just have a tiny bit of added work to relate the relevant angles here,

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,540
and then to note how the speed and the wavelength all depend on each other.

59
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,820
To answer the other questions I want to get to,

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,220
we're going to lean pretty heavily on the explanation from the main video.

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm mostly assuming that people here will have watched that,

62
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,840
but here's a quick recap of the key points.

63
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,380
When we talk about a light wave slowing down in a material,

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,600
what's really going on is that its interaction with each layer of that material

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,540
slightly kicks back the phase of the wave.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,660
Now a continuous sequence of infinitesimal phase kicks like this

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,800
produces something that's mathematically identical to a wave that's just traveling slower.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,980
The actual mechanism for that phase kick is that the incoming light wave

69
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,720
causes the charges in the material to oscillate a little bit.

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,060
Those oscillations produce their own propagation in the electromagnetic field,

71
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,180
and when you add together this newly induced wave with the original one,

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,520
then in the region of space past that layer,

73
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,420
the sum looks just like a copy of that original wave, but shifted back a little.

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,940
The last key point is that if you want to know the size of that phase shift,

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,540
which is what determines the index of refraction,

76
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,800
we model the charges in the material as simple harmonic oscillators,

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,820
bound to some equilibrium position with a linear restoring force.

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,100
What we found is that the amplitude of oscillation,

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
when you shine a light on a charge like this,

80
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,220
will depend on how close the frequency of that light is

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,780
to the resonant frequency associated with this spring-like restoring force.

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,680
Or to put it shortly, the index of refraction

83
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,800
depends on how much the light resonates with charges in the material.

84
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,760
As an example of one phenomenon that this explanation helps us to understand,

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,400
let's take a question asked by Dan Stock, which is what causes birefringence?

86
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,820
So this is a phenomenon where a material has two distinct indices of refraction,

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,680
which has the effect of making you see double when you look through it.

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,340
Imagine you have some kind of crystal structure such that the ions in that structure

89
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,740
will have some restoring force when you pull them in one direction,

90
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,400
which is distinct from the restoring force when you pull them in another direction.

91
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,500
That is, the resonant frequency for oscillations in one direction

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
is distinct from the resonant frequency from oscillations in another.

93
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,780
What that means is if you shine some light through this material,

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,820
then because the index of refraction depends on resonance,

95
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,900
the value of that index of refraction will be different for light that's oscillating up and down

96
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,840
than it will for light that's oscillating side to side.

97
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,360
That is, it depends on the polarization of the light.

98
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,520
And this really happens.

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,560
The example you're looking at right now is calcite, and when you're seeing double,

100
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,720
it's because light with one polarization is getting bent

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,420
at a different rate than light with the other polarization.

102
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,620
For those of you who watched the videos about the barber pole effect,

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,840
a very similar phenomenon answers the final question that we left there.

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,760
If you didn't watch those, feel free to jump ahead, but if you did,

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,700
you might recall that where we left off was with a claim that sugar causes right-handed

106
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,700
circularly polarized light to travel at a slightly different speed

107
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,620
from left-handed circularly polarized light.

108
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,460
The reason that mattered is that it meant linearly polarized light,

109
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,140
which can be expressed as a sum of those two,

110
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,300
will slowly rotate over time as one of those two components lags behind the other.

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,820
Once you understand that an index of refraction depends on resonance,

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,580
you can start to see why something like this might happen.

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,740
If the molecular structure of sucrose was one such that electrons might get pushed along a path

114
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,160
with a clockwise component more freely than they get pushed along paths with counterclockwise

115
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,820
components, well that would mean that the resonance with right-handed circularly polarized

116
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,560
light would be a little different from what it is for left-handed circularly polarized light,

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,580
and hence the indices of refraction would be slightly different for each one.

118
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,900
When you combine this together with the fact that the resonance depends on the frequency of the

119
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,360
light, which is to say it depends on the color, this ultimately explains why the optical rotation

120
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,240
in that barber pole effect separated out the colors the way that it did.

121
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,080
Now one example of a shape that would resonate differently with left-handed and right-handed

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,540
circularly polarized light would be a helix, and in fact people will use a helical antenna

123
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,020
when they want to pick up on radio waves with just one-handedness.

124
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,240
Although sucrose is not so clean and pure an example as a helix, the key property is that

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,780
it is chiral, meaning it's fundamentally different from its mirror image, in that there's no way to

126
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,960
reorient it in 3D space to make it look like its mirror image. I will not pretend to know why this

127
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,780
particular structure resonates with one-handedness more than another, but at least in principle it

128
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,320
makes sense that chirality would lend itself to this phenomenon. And finally, to wrap things up,

129
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,400
let's hit what might be the most intriguing question of them all, which is how the index

130
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,120
of refraction can be lower than one, since what that seems to imply is that the speed of light

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,680
through a medium would be faster than the speed of light. So this really does happen, and it's not as

132
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,480
wild as you might think. If you think back to how everything in our discussion arose from how a

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,880
layer of material can kick back the phase of a wave, there is no reason that the layer of the

134
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,060
material can't also kick forward the phase of that wave, and when you have many successive layers,

135
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,360
kicking forward the phase like this, it gives the illusion of a wave that's traveling faster than

136
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,780
the speed of light, in the sense that those crests genuinely are moving faster than c.

137
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,940
In fact, when you unpack the math underlying all of this, whenever the key amplitude expression

138
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,760
that we wrote down is smaller than zero, that corresponds to an index of refraction smaller

139
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,540
than one. So in particular, if the frequency of the light, omega sub l, is bigger than the resonant

140
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,380
frequency for our oscillator, you have this effect. For example, when you shine an x-ray

141
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,260
through glass, the index of refraction really is smaller than one. There is no contradiction with

142
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,440
causality here, and it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the role played by the speed c

143
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,540
in all of this explanation. c is the speed determining how long it takes for an accelerating

144
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,400
charge to induce a force on any other charge. Even if there's material in the way, whether that

145
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,140
material has an index of refraction bigger than one or less than one, that amount of time that

146
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,460
it takes for the influence of one charge to reach another is always the distance between them divided

147
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:03,600
by c. By contrast, the speed that's relevant to an index of refraction is how fast the crest of one

148
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,920
of those waves is moving. This is known as the phase velocity. That phase velocity is what

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,080
determines how much the wave gets scrunched up, which in turn determines how much it refracts or

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,540
bends, which is part of the reason I think it's very good terminology to call this the index of

151
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,860
refraction rather than say the index of slowing. In general, the electric field inside a medium like

152
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,280
glass is this incredibly complicated sum of a whole bunch of propagating influences from every

153
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,040
one of the wiggling charges in that material, all together with the incoming light wave. But

154
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,900
importantly, all of those individual propagations are traveling at c, never slower, never faster.

155
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,300
It is miraculous that the way that these combine can be described simply at all, and that it's not

156
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,620
some monstrously intractable mess. But we are fortunate, and when you add them all up, the net

157
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,720
effect can be described cleanly, and it looks just like a sine wave, one whose phase velocity happens

158
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,260
to be different from c. Another thing to keep in mind if it seems very weird for these wave

159
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:09,260
crests to move faster than c is that everything in this explanation depends very heavily on things

160
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,940
being in a steady state. That's very different from say, trying to send information through the medium

161
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,480
with a little pulse of light. This is what Mithana explores in her videos on the index of refraction

162
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,180
over on Looking Glass Universe, which you should definitely look at. Over there she talks about how

163
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,980
when you express a pulse of light as a sum of many pure sine waves, even if the phase velocities of

164
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,240
those constituent components go faster than c, that doesn't necessarily imply that the center of

165
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,480
mass of this pulse will itself go faster than c. And in fact, when you simulate the effect of

166
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,780
passing through a medium, when the index of refraction is less than one, what you find is a

167
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,800
pulse that goes slower than c, even when the crests within it are going faster. And if that still seems

168
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,020
a bit weird, here's an analogy to help see why phase velocity can be way higher than the speed

169
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,560
of anything real. Imagine a little machine that has a bunch of rotating arms all extending from

170
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,480
a shared shaft. If you view this machine from the side, the tips of all of those arms form what looks

171
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,840
like a wave, with crests traveling from right to left. But if I go and reposition the arms to be

172
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,100
angled quite close to each other, then you can make it so that the phase velocity of this emergent

173
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,680
wave is arbitrarily high, potentially faster than the speed of light or anything else, even when the

174
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,640
shaft is rotating at a gentle constant rate, and even when every component of the machine is moving

175
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,680
at a reasonably slow pace. Here, it's pretty obvious that such a machine doesn't violate the

176
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,540
rules of physics, and that it doesn't let you send messages faster than light, because the wave crest

177
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,880
is not a real object. It's not something that could carry information. It's more of an illusion.

178
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,740
The phase velocity in a light wave is similar. Sure, if you shine an x-ray through glass, it is

179
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,620
true that the wave crests go faster than the speed of light, but the underlying influences between

180
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,120
electric charges that determine the field values in the first place are themselves all bound by the speed c.
