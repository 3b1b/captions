1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
The last video I put out was about the index of refraction.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,920
It talked about why light slows down when it passes through a medium, 

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,220
and in particular, why the rate of slowdown would depend on color.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,219
It turns out people have a lot of questions about the index of refraction, 

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,960
and in this supplemental video I wanted to take a chance to answer a couple of them.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,746
For example, how is it possible for this index to be lower than one, 

7
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:25,966
which seems to imply that light would travel faster than the speed of light through 

8
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:26,720
some materials.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,684
To kick things off though, I want to take a question that does not 

10
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:38,614
require too much background, asked by Kevin O'Toole, 

11
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:43,480
which is why exactly light slowing down would imply that it bends as it enters a medium.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,264
There's a common analogy, which is to think of something like a car or a tank, 

13
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:52,118
where it turns a little bit while one side of it slows down before the other, 

14
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,517
and although it's a very visceral and memorable analogy, it's not like light has wheels, 

15
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:59,680
and it also tells you nothing about how to be more quantitative.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,860
Derive the formula describing exactly how much light bends.

17
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,900
Here's a better way to think about it.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,325
If you have some light wave shining into a material like glass, 

19
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:13,240
if it slows down, notice how that means that it gets kind of scrunched up.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,105
If its wavelength in a vacuum was some number lambda, 

21
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:19,709
then the wavelength inside this material, where it's gotten slowed down, 

22
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,240
is something smaller than that.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,048
Here I am drawing the wave only on a one-dimensional line, 

24
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:30,004
but we need to understand it in at least two dimensions, where every point on this plane, 

25
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:34,519
for example, is associated with a little vector in the electric field oscillating 

26
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,180
up and down.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,331
This particular animation is a little bit messy and hard to follow, 

28
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,344
so it might be clearer if instead we simply color every point of the plane, 

29
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:46,618
such that those points are white near the crests of the wave, 

30
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,520
and then black away from the crests.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,580
You can still clearly see the wavelength as the distance between these crests.

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,253
It's exactly what we were looking at before, just drawn in a different way, 

33
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:59,280
and in particular notice how they're scrunched up inside the glass.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,394
If that glass were positioned at an angle, think 

35
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:05,020
about what happens to each one of those wave crests.

36
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,660
As it hits the glass, the lower parts slow down before the top parts, 

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,940
causing it to get sort of smeared out.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,980
It reminds me a little of the rolling shutter effect, 

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,780
and overall the wave crest ends up at a different angle.

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,637
When you take into account the fact that for a beam of light, 

41
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:24,420
the beam is always perpendicular to those wave crests, 

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,164
this means your light has to turn, and moreover you can calculate exactly 

43
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,480
how much it needs to turn.

44
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,891
Think about all those waves in the vacuum, with some kind of wavelength 

45
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:37,512
lambda-1 sitting between them, and focus on all the points where those 

46
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:40,980
crests intersect with the boundary between the vacuum and the glass.

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,040
But then consider those wave crests inside the glass.

48
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,347
If it was the case that no bending happened, then because the wavelength is smaller in 

49
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:50,957
there, when you look at all those intersection points, 

50
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,760
they would have to be closer together.

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,252
But of course that can't happen, whether you're looking at it from one side, 

52
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:59,700
or looking at it from the other, those intersection points are all the same.

53
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,970
So the only way this can work is if those wave crests 

54
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,620
inside the glass were oriented at a different angle.

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,365
You might mentally imagine turning them with a little knob to find 

56
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:12,340
the sweet spot angle where all those intersection points line up.

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,835
And for those of you into exercises, you could take a moment to try to write down 

58
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:20,940
the specific equation telling you how to relate the wavelengths inside and outside 

59
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,700
the glass with the angles between those wave crests and the boundary itself.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,035
If you do this, what you write down is effectively the same thing as Snell's law, 

61
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:32,287
you just have a tiny bit of added work to relate the relevant angles here, 

62
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,540
and then to note how the speed and the wavelength all depend on each other.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,029
To answer the other questions I want to get to, 

64
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:42,220
we're going to lean pretty heavily on the explanation from the main video.

65
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,681
I'm mostly assuming that people here will have watched that, 

66
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,840
but here's a quick recap of the key points.

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,796
When we talk about a light wave slowing down in a material, 

68
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:54,947
what's really going on is that its interaction with each 

69
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,540
layer of that material slightly kicks back the phase of the wave.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,201
Now a continuous sequence of infinitesimal phase kicks like this produces 

71
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,800
something that's mathematically identical to a wave that's just traveling slower.

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,173
The actual mechanism for that phase kick is that the incoming light 

73
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:15,720
wave causes the charges in the material to oscillate a little bit.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,197
Those oscillations produce their own propagation in the electromagnetic field, 

75
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:24,335
and when you add together this newly induced wave with the original one, 

76
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:28,245
then in the region of space past that layer, the sum looks just like 

77
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:31,420
a copy of that original wave, but shifted back a little.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,513
The last key point is that if you want to know the size of that phase shift, 

79
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:39,313
which is what determines the index of refraction, 

80
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:43,179
we model the charges in the material as simple harmonic oscillators, 

81
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,820
bound to some equilibrium position with a linear restoring force.

82
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,376
What we found is that the amplitude of oscillation, 

83
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:54,784
when you shine a light on a charge like this, will depend on how close the 

84
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:59,134
frequency of that light is to the resonant frequency associated with this 

85
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,780
spring-like restoring force.

86
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,451
Or to put it shortly, the index of refraction depends on 

87
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,800
how much the light resonates with charges in the material.

88
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,023
As an example of one phenomenon that this explanation helps us to understand, 

89
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:17,400
let's take a question asked by Dan Stock, which is what causes birefringence?

90
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,653
So this is a phenomenon where a material has two distinct indices of refraction, 

91
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:26,680
which has the effect of making you see double when you look through it.

92
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,572
Imagine you have some kind of crystal structure such that the ions in that 

93
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:35,849
structure will have some restoring force when you pull them in one direction, 

94
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,400
which is distinct from the restoring force when you pull them in another direction.

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,820
That is, the resonant frequency for oscillations in one direction 

96
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,500
is distinct from the resonant frequency from oscillations in another.

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,474
What that means is if you shine some light through this material, 

98
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:55,652
then because the index of refraction depends on resonance, 

99
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:59,207
the value of that index of refraction will be different for light 

100
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,840
that's oscillating up and down than it will for light that's oscillating side to side.

101
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,360
That is, it depends on the polarization of the light.

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,520
And this really happens.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,284
The example you're looking at right now is calcite, 

104
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:14,779
and when you're seeing double, it's because light with one polarization 

105
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:18,420
is getting bent at a different rate than light with the other polarization.

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,260
For those of you who watched the videos about the barber pole effect, 

107
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,840
a very similar phenomenon answers the final question that we left there.

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,246
If you didn't watch those, feel free to jump ahead, but if you did, 

109
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:36,275
you might recall that where we left off was with a claim that sugar causes right-handed 

110
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:41,076
circularly polarized light to travel at a slightly different speed from left-handed 

111
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,620
circularly polarized light.

112
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,476
The reason that mattered is that it meant linearly polarized light, 

113
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:51,449
which can be expressed as a sum of those two, will slowly rotate 

114
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,300
over time as one of those two components lags behind the other.

115
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,553
Once you understand that an index of refraction depends on resonance, 

116
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,580
you can start to see why something like this might happen.

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,382
If the molecular structure of sucrose was one such that electrons might get 

118
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:11,303
pushed along a path with a clockwise component more freely than they get 

119
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:14,150
pushed along paths with counterclockwise components, 

120
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,394
well that would mean that the resonance with right-handed circularly polarized 

121
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:22,530
light would be a little different from what it is for left-handed circularly 

122
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,344
polarized light, and hence the indices of refraction would be slightly 

123
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,580
different for each one.

124
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,485
When you combine this together with the fact that the resonance depends on the frequency 

125
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,516
of the light, which is to say it depends on the color, 

126
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:40,311
this ultimately explains why the optical rotation in that barber pole effect separated 

127
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,240
out the colors the way that it did.

128
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,125
Now one example of a shape that would resonate differently with left-handed and 

129
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,160
right-handed circularly polarized light would be a helix, 

130
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,398
and in fact people will use a helical antenna when they want to pick up on radio 

131
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:56,020
waves with just one-handedness.

132
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,564
Although sucrose is not so clean and pure an example as a helix, 

133
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:04,198
the key property is that it is chiral, meaning it's fundamentally different from its 

134
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:08,833
mirror image, in that there's no way to reorient it in 3D space to make it look like 

135
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,760
its mirror image.

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,344
I will not pretend to know why this particular structure resonates 

137
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,355
with one-handedness more than another, but at least in principle 

138
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:19,460
it makes sense that chirality would lend itself to this phenomenon.

139
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,345
And finally, to wrap things up, let's hit what might be the most 

140
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:27,991
intriguing question of them all, which is how the index of refraction 

141
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:31,429
can be lower than one, since what that seems to imply is that the 

142
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:35,179
speed of light through a medium would be faster than the speed of light.

143
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,659
So this really does happen, and it's not as wild as you might think.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,525
If you think back to how everything in our discussion arose from how a layer of material 

145
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:47,847
can kick back the phase of a wave, there is no reason that the layer of the material 

146
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:52,423
can't also kick forward the phase of that wave, and when you have many successive layers, 

147
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:56,796
kicking forward the phase like this, it gives the illusion of a wave that's traveling 

148
00:08:56,796 --> 00:09:01,068
faster than the speed of light, in the sense that those crests genuinely are moving 

149
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:01,780
faster than c.

150
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,286
In fact, when you unpack the math underlying all of this, 

151
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:09,272
whenever the key amplitude expression that we wrote down is smaller than zero, 

152
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:12,300
that corresponds to an index of refraction smaller than one.

153
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,549
So in particular, if the frequency of the light, omega sub l, 

154
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:21,480
is bigger than the resonant frequency for our oscillator, you have this effect.

155
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,342
For example, when you shine an x-ray through glass, 

156
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:26,620
the index of refraction really is smaller than one.

157
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,192
There is no contradiction with causality here, 

158
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:34,336
and it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the role played by the speed 

159
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,960
c in all of this explanation.

160
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,851
c is the speed determining how long it takes for an 

161
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:43,500
accelerating charge to induce a force on any other charge.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,450
Even if there's material in the way, whether that material has an index of refraction 

163
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,900
bigger than one or less than one, that amount of time that it takes for the influence 

164
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,040
of one charge to reach another is always the distance between them divided by c.

165
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,065
By contrast, the speed that's relevant to an index of 

166
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:04,900
refraction is how fast the crest of one of those waves is moving.

167
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,100
This is known as the phase velocity.

168
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,513
That phase velocity is what determines how much the wave gets scrunched up, 

169
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,381
which in turn determines how much it refracts or bends, 

170
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:18,941
which is part of the reason I think it's very good terminology to call this the index of 

171
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:21,400
refraction rather than say the index of slowing.

172
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,523
In general, the electric field inside a medium like glass is this incredibly 

173
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:30,927
complicated sum of a whole bunch of propagating influences from every one of 

174
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:35,560
the wiggling charges in that material, all together with the incoming light wave.

175
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,306
But importantly, all of those individual propagations are traveling at c, 

176
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,900
never slower, never faster.

177
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,394
It is miraculous that the way that these combine can be described simply at all, 

178
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:49,280
and that it's not some monstrously intractable mess.

179
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,602
But we are fortunate, and when you add them all up, 

180
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:56,780
the net effect can be described cleanly, and it looks just like a sine wave, 

181
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,820
one whose phase velocity happens to be different from c.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,803
Another thing to keep in mind if it seems very weird for these 

183
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:07,099
wave crests to move faster than c is that everything in this 

184
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,720
explanation depends very heavily on things being in a steady state.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,363
That's very different from say, trying to send 

186
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:16,380
information through the medium with a little pulse of light.

187
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,498
This is what Mithana explores in her videos on the index of refraction 

188
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:23,620
over on Looking Glass Universe, which you should definitely look at.

189
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,734
Over there she talks about how when you express a pulse of light as 

190
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:31,544
a sum of many pure sine waves, even if the phase velocities of those 

191
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:35,189
constituent components go faster than c, that doesn't necessarily 

192
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:39,220
imply that the center of mass of this pulse will itself go faster than c.

193
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,084
And in fact, when you simulate the effect of passing through a medium, 

194
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:45,365
when the index of refraction is less than one, 

195
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,791
what you find is a pulse that goes slower than c, 

196
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,120
even when the crests within it are going faster.

197
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,417
And if that still seems a bit weird, here's an analogy to help see 

198
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:58,020
why phase velocity can be way higher than the speed of anything real.

199
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,438
Imagine a little machine that has a bunch of rotating 

200
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,560
arms all extending from a shared shaft.

201
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,880
If you view this machine from the side, the tips of all of those arms 

202
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,720
form what looks like a wave, with crests traveling from right to left.

203
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,719
But if I go and reposition the arms to be angled quite close to each other, 

204
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,599
then you can make it so that the phase velocity of this emergent wave is 

205
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:24,798
arbitrarily high, potentially faster than the speed of light or anything else, 

206
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,934
even when the shaft is rotating at a gentle constant rate, 

207
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:32,240
and even when every component of the machine is moving at a reasonably slow pace.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,737
Here, it's pretty obvious that such a machine doesn't violate the rules of physics, 

209
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:39,655
and that it doesn't let you send messages faster than light, 

210
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,760
because the wave crest is not a real object.

211
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,820
It's not something that could carry information.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,880
It's more of an illusion.

213
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,620
The phase velocity in a light wave is similar.

214
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,655
Sure, if you shine an x-ray through glass, it is true that the wave crests go faster 

215
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:57,151
than the speed of light, but the underlying influences between electric charges that 

216
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:01,700
determine the field values in the first place are themselves all bound by the speed c.
