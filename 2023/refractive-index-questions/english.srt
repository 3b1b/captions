1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
The last video I put out was about the index of refraction.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,400
It talked about why light slows down when it passes through a medium,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,640
and in particular, why the rate of slowdown would depend on color.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
It turns out people have a lot of questions about the index of refraction,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,160
and in this supplemental video I wanted to take a chance to answer a couple of them.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,240
For example, how is it possible for this index to be lower than one,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,720
which seems to imply that light would travel faster than the speed of light through some materials.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,320
To kick things off though, I want to take a question that does not require too much background,

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
asked by Kevin O'Toole, which is why exactly light slowing down

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,240
would imply that it bends as it enters a medium.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,080
There's a common analogy, which is to think of something like a car or a tank,

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,000
where it turns a little bit while one side of it slows down before the other,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,200
and although it's a very visceral and memorable analogy,

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,920
it's not like light has wheels, and it also tells you nothing about how to be more quantitative.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,240
And derive the formula describing exactly how much light bends.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,840
Here's a better way to think about it.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
If you have some light wave shining into a material like glass,

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
if it slows down, notice how that means that it gets kind of scrunched up.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,240
If its wavelength in a vacuum was some number lambda,

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
then the wavelength inside this material, where it's gotten slowed down,

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
is something smaller than that.

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
Here I am drawing the wave only on a one-dimensional line,

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
but we need to understand it in at least two dimensions,

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
where every point on this plane, for example,

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
is associated with a little vector in the electric field oscillating up and down.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,960
This particular animation is a little bit messy and hard to follow,

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,880
so it might be clearer if instead we simply color every point of the plane,

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,480
such that those points are white near the crests of the wave,

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,880
and then black away from the crests.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,800
You can still clearly see the wavelength as the distance between these crests.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,320
It's exactly what we were looking at before, just drawn in a different way,

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,120
and in particular notice how they're scrunched up inside the glass.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,240
If that glass were positioned at an angle,

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
think about what happens to each one of those wave crests.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
As it hits the glass, the lower parts slow down before the top parts,

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,000
causing it to get sort of smeared out.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,320
It reminds me a little of the rolling shutter effect,

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
and overall the wave crest ends up at a different angle.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,960
When you take into account the fact that for a beam of light,

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,000
the beam is always perpendicular to those wave crests,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
this means your light has to turn,

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
and moreover you can calculate exactly how much it needs to turn.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Think about all those waves in the vacuum,

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,120
with some kind of wavelength lambda-1 sitting between them,

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,480
and focus on all the points where those crests intersect

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
with the boundary between the vacuum and the glass.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
But then consider those wave crests inside the glass.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
If it was the case that no bending happened,

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
then because the wavelength is smaller in there,

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,960
when you look at all those intersection points,

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,120
they would have to be closer together.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
But of course that can't happen,

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
whether you're looking at it from one side,

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
or looking at it from the other,

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,520
those intersection points are all the same.

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
So the only way this can work is if those wave crests inside the glass

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
were oriented at a different angle.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
You might mentally imagine turning them with a little knob

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,560
to find the sweet spot angle where all those intersection points line up.

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
And for those of you into exercises,

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,600
you could take a moment to try to write down the specific equation

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,040
telling you how to relate the wavelengths inside and outside the glass

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,560
with the angles between those wave crests and the boundary itself.

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,960
If you do this, what you write down is effectively the same thing as Snell's Law,

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,240
you just have a tiny bit of added work to relate the relevant angles here,

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,440
and then to note how the speed and the wavelength all depend on each other.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,960
To answer the other questions I want to get to,

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,480
we're going to lean pretty heavily on the explanation from the main video.

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm mostly assuming that people here will have watched that,

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,760
but here's a quick recap of the key points.

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,520
When we talk about a light wave slowing down in a material,

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,000
what's really going on is that its interaction with each layer of that material

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,720
slightly kicks back the phase of the wave.

74
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Now a continuous sequence of infinitesimal phase kicks like this

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,680
produces something that's mathematically identical

76
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
to a wave that's just traveling slower.

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,000
The actual mechanism for that phase kick is that the incoming light wave

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
causes the charges in the material to oscillate a little bit.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,320
Those oscillations produce their own propagation in the electromagnetic field,

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
and when you add together this newly induced wave with the original one,

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,800
then in the region of space past that layer,

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
the sum looks just like a copy of that original wave, but shifted back a little.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,080
The last key point is that if you want to know the size of that phase shift,

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,800
which is what determines the index of refraction,

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,040
we model the charges in the material as simple harmonic oscillators,

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
bound to some equilibrium position with a linear restoring force.

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
What we found is that the amplitude of oscillation,

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,640
when you shine a light on a charge like this,

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,400
will depend on how close the frequency of that light is

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
to the resonant frequency associated with this spring-like restoring force.

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,920
Or, to put it shortly, the index of refraction

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,760
depends on how much the light resonates with charges in the material.

93
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,960
As an example of one phenomenon that this explanation helps us to understand,

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,920
let's take a question asked by Dan Stock, which is what causes birefringence?

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,040
So, this is a phenomenon where a material has two distinct indices of refraction,

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,320
which has the effect of making you see double when you look through it.

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Imagine you have some kind of crystal structure,

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,080
such that the ions in that structure will have some restoring force when you pull them in one direction,

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,320
which is distinct from the restoring force when you pull them in another direction.

100
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,800
That is, the resonant frequency for oscillations in one direction

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
is distinct from the resonant frequency from oscillations in another.

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
What that means is if you shine some light through this material,

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
then because the index of refraction depends on resonance,

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,040
the value of that index of refraction will be different for light that's oscillating up and down

105
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,680
than it will for light that's oscillating side to side.

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
That is, it depends on the polarization of the light.

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
And this really happens.

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,640
The example you're looking at right now is calcite, and when you're seeing double,

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,880
it's because light with one polarization

110
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
is getting bent at a different rate than light with the other polarization.

111
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,880
For those of you who watched the videos about the barber pole effect,

112
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,720
a very similar phenomenon answers the final question that we left there.

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
If you didn't watch those, feel free to jump ahead, but if you did,

114
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,760
you might recall that where we left off was with a claim

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,360
that sugar causes right-handed circularly polarized light

116
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,480
to travel at a slightly different speed from left-handed circularly polarized light.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,560
The reason that mattered is that it meant linearly polarized light,

118
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
which can be expressed as a sum of those two,

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,120
will slowly rotate over time as one of those two components lags behind the other.

120
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,160
Once you understand that an index of refraction depends on resonance,

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
you can start to see why something like this might happen.

122
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,880
If the molecular structure of sucrose was one such that electrons might get pushed along a path with

123
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,640
a clockwise component more freely than they get pushed along paths with counterclockwise components,

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,360
well, that would mean that the resonance with right-handed circularly polarized light

125
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,840
would be a little different from what it is for left-handed circularly polarized light,

126
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,360
and hence the indices of refraction would be slightly different for each one.

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,040
When you combine this together with the fact that the resonance

128
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,600
depends on the frequency of the light, which is to say it depends on the color,

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,760
this ultimately explains why the optical rotation in that barber pole effect

130
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,080
separated out the colors the way that it did.

131
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,480
Now, one example of a shape that would resonate differently with left-handed and

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,080
right-handed circularly polarized light would be a helix, and in fact people will use a helical

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,240
antenna when they want to pick up on radio waves with just one-handedness.

134
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,920
Although sucrose is not so clean and pure an example as a helix,

135
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,600
the key property is that it is chiral, meaning it's fundamentally different from its mirror image,

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,000
in that there's no way to reorient it in 3D space to make it look like its mirror image.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,560
I will not pretend to know why this particular structure resonates with one-handedness more than

138
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,440
another, but at least in principle it makes sense that chirality would lend itself to this phenomenon.

139
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,200
And finally, to wrap things up, let's hit what might be the most intriguing question of them all,

140
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,160
which is how the index of refraction can be lower than one,

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,040
since what that seems to imply is that the speed of light through a medium

142
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,360
would be faster than the speed of light.

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
So this really does happen, and it's not as wild as you might think.

144
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,200
If you think back to how everything in our discussion arose from how a layer of material

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,520
can kick back the phase of a wave, there is no reason that the layer of the material can't

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,560
also kick forward the phase of that wave, and when you have many successive layers all kicking

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,600
forward the phase like this, it gives the illusion of a wave that's traveling faster than the speed

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,160
of light, in the sense that those crests genuinely are moving faster than c.

149
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,800
In fact, when you unpack the math underlying all of this, whenever the key amplitude expression

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,680
that we wrote down is smaller than zero, that corresponds to an index of refraction smaller

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,560
than one. So in particular, if the frequency of the light, omega sub l, is bigger than the resonant

152
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,160
frequency for our oscillator, you have this effect. For example, when you shine an x-ray through glass,

153
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
the index of refraction really is smaller than one.

154
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,640
There is no contradiction with causality here, and it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the

155
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,040
role played by the speed c in all of this explanation. C is the speed determining how long

156
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,120
it takes for an accelerating charge to induce a force on any other charge. Even if there's material

157
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,840
in the way, whether that material has an index of refraction bigger than one or less than one,

158
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,840
that amount of time that it takes for the influence of one charge to reach another

159
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,320
is always the distance between them divided by c. By contrast, the speed that's relevant to an

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,080
index of refraction is how fast the crest of one of those waves is moving. This is known as the

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,440
phase velocity. That phase velocity is what determines how much the wave gets scrunched up,

162
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,840
which in turn determines how much it refracts or bends, which is part of the reason I think

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,360
it's very good terminology to call this the index of refraction rather than say the index of slowing.

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,000
In general, the electric field inside a medium like glass is this incredibly complicated sum

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,680
of a whole bunch of propagating influences from every one of the wiggling charges in that material,

166
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,000
all together with the incoming light wave. But importantly, all of those individual

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,840
propagations are traveling at c, never slower, never faster. It is miraculous that the way that

168
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,600
these combine can be described simply at all, and that it's not some monstrously intractable mess.

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,400
But we are fortunate, and when you add them all up, the net effect can be described cleanly,

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,680
and it looks just like a sine wave, one whose phase velocity happens to be different from c.

171
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,120
Another thing to keep in mind if it seems very weird for these wave crests to move faster than c

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,960
is that everything in this explanation depends very heavily on things being in a steady state.

173
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,520
That's very different from say trying to send information through the medium with a little

174
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,640
pulse of light. This is what Mithina explores in her videos on the index of refraction over

175
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,800
on Looking Glass Universe, which you should definitely look at. Over there she talks about

176
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,720
how when you express a pulse of light as a sum of many pure sine waves, even if the phase velocities

177
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,080
of those constituent components go faster than c, that doesn't necessarily imply that the center of

178
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,360
mass of this pulse will itself go faster than c. And in fact, when you simulate the effect of

179
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
passing through a medium, when the index of refraction is less than one, what you find is

180
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,200
a pulse that goes slower than c, even when the crests within it are going faster. And if that

181
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,640
still seems a bit weird, here's an analogy to help see why phase velocity can be way higher than the

182
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,240
speed of anything real. Imagine a little machine that has a bunch of rotating arms all extending

183
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,160
from a shared shaft. If you view this machine from the side, the tips of all of those arms form what

184
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,080
looks like a wave, with crests traveling from right to left. But if I go and reposition the

185
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,600
arms to be angled quite close to each other, then you can make it so that the phase velocity of this

186
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,040
emergent wave is arbitrarily high, potentially faster than the speed of light or anything else,

187
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,600
even when the shaft is rotating at a gentle constant rate, and even when every component of

188
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,720
the machine is moving at a reasonably slow pace. Here it's pretty obvious that such a machine

189
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,440
doesn't violate the rules of physics, and that it doesn't let you send messages faster than light,

190
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,840
because the wave crest is not a real object. It's not something that could carry information,

191
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,120
it's more of an illusion. The phase velocity in a light wave is similar. Sure, if you shine an

192
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,680
x-ray through glass, it is true that the wave crests go faster than the speed of light, but

193
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,040
the underlying influences between electric charges that determine the field values in the first place

194
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,360
are themselves all bound by the speed c.
