1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
This is a very famous cautionary tale in math, known as Moser's circle problem.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,080
Some of you may have seen this before, but what I want to do here is really explain what's going on.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,200
The way this starts is we take a circle and put two points on that circle

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,760
and connect them with a line, that is a chord of the circle,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,060
and note that it divides the circle into two different regions.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,460
If I add a third point and then connect that to the previous two points with two more chords,

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,260
then these lines all divide the circle into four separate regions.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,400
Then if you add a fourth point and connect that to the previous three,

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,340
and you play the same game, you count up how many regions has this cut the circle into,

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,940
you end up with eight.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,840
Add a fifth point to the circle, connect it to the previous four,

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,500
count up the total number of regions, and if you're careful with your counting,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,140
you'll get a total of sixteen.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,280
Naturally, you can guess what might come next, but would you bet your life on it?

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,960
Add a sixth point, connect it to all the previous ones,

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,680
and if you carefully count up all the different regions,

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,660
you end up not with the power of two you might have expected, but just one shy of it.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,780
Some of you might be raising your hand saying,

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,960
doesn't it depend on where we put the points?

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,160
For example, watch how this middle region disappears

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,100
if I place everything nice and symmetrically around the circle.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,140
So yes, it does depend, but we're going to consider the cases

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,300
where you never have any three lines intersecting with each other.

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,780
This would be the generic case if you just choose n random points,

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,240
almost certainly you'll never have three lines coincide,

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,980
but setting aside the technical nuances, the problem is such a tease,

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,540
it looks so convincingly like powers of two until it just barely breaks.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,080
And I have such a strange soft spot for this particular question.

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,280
When I was younger I wrote a poem about it and also a song.

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,760
And on the one hand it's kind of silly, because this is just one example

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,600
of what the mathematician Richard Guy called the strong law of small numbers,

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,720
summed up in the phrase,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there aren't enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of them.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,280
But I think what I really like about this problem is that

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,100
if you sit down to try to work out what is the real pattern,

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,600
what's actually going on here,

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,460
one, it's just a really good exercise in problem solving,

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
so it makes for a nice lesson right here,

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,680
but also it's not just a coincidence that it starts off being powers of two.

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,620
There's a very good reason this happens.

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,940
And it's also not a coincidence that you seemingly randomly hit

42
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,920
another power of two a little bit later on the tenth iteration.

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,600
So we've got this pattern, and what you want to find

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,300
is what function describes it.

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,800
If you put n points on the boundary of a circle,

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,200
and you connect them with all the possible chords,

47
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,140
and you count how many regions the circle has been cut into,

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,780
if the answer isn't a power of two, what is it?

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,660
What function of n should we plug in?

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,820
As always with math, problem solving rule number one if you're stuck

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,140
is to try solving easier questions somehow related to the problem at hand.

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,460
It helps you get a foothold,

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,260
and sometimes those answers are helpful in the final question.

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,260
In this case, two warm-up questions that come to mind are,

55
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,920
chords are there in this diagram,

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,500
and at how many points within the circle do those chords intersect each other?

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,940
The first question is relatively friendly.

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,840
Every one of those chords corresponds uniquely with a pair of points on the circle.

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,420
So effectively what you want to do is count

60
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,800
how many distinct pairs of points are there.

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,980
There's a function that does this, it's called n choose two.

62
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,380
By definition, this counts the number of distinct pairs

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,340
that you can choose from a set of n items, where order doesn't matter.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,760
To calculate it, the way you often think about it

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,800
is that you have n choices for what your first item should be,

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,020
and then you have n minus one options for what that second item should be,

67
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,840
but simply multiplying those would over count,

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,140
since for a given pair you would have two distinct ways to arrive at that pair.

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
And remember, we don't care about order.

70
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,420
To account for this, you divide by two.

71
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,640
So for example, seven choose two would look like seven times six divided by two,

72
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,000
which is seven times three, or twenty-one,

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,700
and if you count up the number of distinct pairs of seven items,

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,860
there are indeed twenty-one of them.

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,940
Counting the number of intersection points in the diagram is a little bit trickier.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,700
One idea might be that it should be the number of pairs of chords,

77
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,460
since every intersection point comes from two different chords.

78
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,740
However, that would not quite be right,

79
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,700
because the association is not unique.

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,260
You can find a pair of chords that don't intersect within the circle.

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,240
As I said, it's a little bit tricky.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,060
I'd encourage you to try to pause and think about it for yourself,

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,880
and if you do that, you give yourself a moment,

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,160
maybe if you're a little bit lucky, here's one thing you might notice.

85
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,480
Every intersection point is uniquely associated

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,920
with a quadruplet of points on the exterior.

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,580
For a given quadruplet, you look at the two kind of diagonal chords between them,

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,560
and those will intersect within the circle,

89
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
and it goes the other way around.

90
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,740
Every intersection point corresponds with some quadruplet of points.

91
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,280
So, what you want now is to count how many distinct ways

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,460
can you choose four items given n total choices.

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,380
This is very similar to the previous question.

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,440
The function that answers it is called n choose four,

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
which by definition counts the number of quadruplets from a set of size n,

96
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,000
and the way to calculate it is similar to what we saw before.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,680
You would think of having n choices for your first item,

98
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,780
leaving you with n minus one choices for the next item,

99
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,960
leaving you with n minus two choices for the third item,

100
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,940
and n minus three choices for the last item.

101
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,660
That, however, would grossly overcount the total number,

102
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,880
since all the different ways you can permute these four items

103
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,180
would be counted separately.

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,080
To account for that, you divide out by the extent to which you've overcounted,

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,320
the number of permutations of four items, which looks like four factorial.

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,160
For example, if you calculate four choose four, everything cancels and you just get one,

107
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,140
and indeed there is a single intersection point in this diagram.

108
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,320
If you calculate six choose four, it works out to be 15,

109
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,160
and if you look at this diagram and you count them all up,

110
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,500
you would notice there are indeed 15 different intersection points.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,800
And even if you would never want to count it up by hand,

112
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,420
if we had a diagram that has 100 distinct points on the exterior,

113
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,620
and we drew all of the connecting lines,

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,900
you can conclude that there have to be 100 choose four,

115
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,940
or just about four million intersection points somewhere in the middle.

116
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
You've probably guessed this, but these are more than just warm-up questions.

117
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,600
They give us the necessary information to answer the question we care about.

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,980
How many regions has the circle been cut into?

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,620
The trick is to use a very nice little fact about planar graphs.

120
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,840
Here I'm using the word graph in the sense of a diagram that has nodes and lines connecting them,

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,060
and what it means to be planar is that you can draw this diagram

122
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,700
without any of the lines intersecting with each other.

123
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,840
In graph theory lingo, you typically call those nodes vertices and the lines connecting them edges,

124
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,300
and the wonderful fact that we can leverage is that if you count up the number of vertices,

125
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,200
and then you subtract the total number of edges,

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,680
and then you consider the number of regions that this graph has cut the plane into,

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,940
including that infinite outer region,

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,300
then always, no matter what planar graph you started with, you get two.

129
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,780
It's actually very fun. Try this for yourself.

130
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,520
Draw any graph, make sure the lines don't intersect,

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,140
and then count the number of vertices, subtract the number of edges,

132
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,620
and count the number of regions that it's cut the plane into,

133
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,160
and no matter what diagram you chose, the answer always works out to be two.

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,640
More commonly you would see this written as v minus e plus f is equal to two,

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,660
since originally the equation described the vertices edges and faces of three-dimensional polyhedra,

136
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,880
and if you want to know why this magical fact is true,

137
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,140
you can think about building up your graph from a trivial case,

138
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,820
where you have a single node and no edges.

139
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,660
So v would be equal to one, f would also be equal to one because of that infinite outer region,

140
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,960
and e is zero, so the equation is obviously true.

141
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Then if you build up your graph one edge at a time,

142
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,080
one thing that could happen is that for each new edge you introduce a new vertex.

143
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,260
So e goes up by one, but v also goes up by one,

144
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,780
leaving the equation balanced.

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,120
But if a new edge doesn't correspond to a new vertex,

146
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
meaning it's connecting to a pre-existing vertex,

147
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,740
that means that it's enclosed a new region of space,

148
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,420
so e goes up by one, but f also goes up by one,

149
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,800
which again leaves the equation balanced.

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,620
So as you build up some potentially complicated graph,

151
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,140
v minus e plus f always stays fixed at two.

152
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,620
This equation has a name, it's called Euler's characteristic formula,

153
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,360
and I remember when I made a video about this a while ago,

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,880
I had some dumb joke in there about Euler's being German for beautiful,

155
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,560
and there were a decent number of comments that were like,

156
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,840
you know, Euler is actually a person, I speak German, and it doesn't mean beautiful.

157
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,760
Anyway, for our purposes, it gives us a tool for counting the number of regions

158
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,240
that a planar graph has cut space into.

159
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,540
Rearranging a little, you would take the number of edges minus the number of vertices plus two.

160
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,700
This is exactly the tool that we want to understand our circle question,

161
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,720
although in that case we don't care about the infinite outer region,

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,020
so instead I'll write this as e minus v plus one.

163
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,720
And at first you might complain, but we can't use Euler's formula in this case,

164
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,840
because it only applies to planar graphs,

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,020
and in our case the lines absolutely intersect with each other.

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,720
We even counted how many times they intersect with each other.

167
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
But the key is to treat this as a new graph,

168
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,140
where those intersection points are themselves vertices,

169
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,200
so the total number of vertices here would not be n,

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,780
but n plus the n choose 4 total intersection points.

171
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,940
That in turn chops up all of our chords into a larger number of edges,

172
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,920
it's much more than just n choose 2,

173
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,700
and initially it might seem really annoying and tricky

174
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,380
to think about exactly how much it's chopped them up,

175
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,460
but one way you can think about it is that every intersection point

176
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,100
takes what started as two separate lines and then turns it into four lines.

177
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,540
So in effect, each intersection point adds two more edges.

178
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,360
For example, look at this simple diagram where we have three lines and two intersection points.

179
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,580
The total number of edges after the chopping would look like 3 plus 2 times 2, or 7.

180
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,200
If you had four lines that intersected at three separate points,

181
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,340
then the total number of little lines after chopping would be 4 plus 2 times 3, or 10.

182
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,300
And for the diagram we care about, where we started off with n choose 2 separate lines,

183
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,800
and they're getting chopped up at n choose 4 points in the middle,

184
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,140
you would end up with n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 edges.

185
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,780
And actually there are a few more than that, because we're including the circle,

186
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,560
we also need to count the n different arcs that sit on the outside of this diagram.

187
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,560
So with all of that, you have the information you need to answer the original question,

188
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,140
pulling up our variant of Euler's formula that counts the number of regions,

189
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,640
plugging in the expression for the number of vertices, which is n plus the n choose 4 intersection points,

190
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,600
and you also plug in the slightly larger expression for the new number of edges,

191
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,520
n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 plus n,

192
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,840
and the expression has a lot of nice cancellation,

193
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,040
for example you are adding an n but also subtracting an n,

194
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,700
and you're adding two copies of n choose 4 but subtracting another copy of n choose 4,

195
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,720
and when all the dust settles, the answer to the question is 1 plus n choose 2 plus n choose 4.

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,380
On the one hand, you're done, you answered the question.

197
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,940
I give you one of these circle diagrams with n points on the boundary,

198
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,820
and using this formula you can figure out how many regions the circle has been cut into.

199
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,200
But of course we're not really done, because that doesn't scratch the itch.

200
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,180
Why is it the case that this looks like powers of 2 and then falls short by just 1?

201
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not just a coincidence, and the key to answering it is to consider Pascal's triangle.

202
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,700
You know this triangle, it's the one where each term looks like a sum

203
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,560
of the two different terms above it,

204
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,920
and there are basically two facts we need to bring in about this triangle.

205
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,020
The first is that every term inside this triangle looks like n choose k for some value of n and k.

206
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,460
That is, the answer to the question of how many ways can you select a subset of size k

207
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,100
from a set of size n is visible within this triangle.

208
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,100
The way to think about it is by indexing the rows and columns starting from 0.

209
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,220
For example, if you count up to the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th row,

210
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,100
you count in to the 0, 1, 2, 3rd element, you see 10.

211
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,040
And indeed, 5 choose 3 is equal to 10.

212
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,520
If you've never seen this before and you want to know why it's true,

213
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,720
there's a really lovely argument, I'll leave it up as an exercise.

214
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,700
But moving on to the second thing that we need to know,

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,880
notice what happens when you add up the rows of this triangle.

216
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,120
You get 1, and then 1 plus 1 is 2, 1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4, 1 plus 3 plus 3 plus 1 is 8,

217
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,400
and as you continue on, you always get powers of 2.

218
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,220
Maybe at this point you're a little gun-shy about jumping to conclusions about powers of 2 too

219
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,140
quickly, but in this case it's a genuine pattern, there's no trickery being pulled.

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,500
And there are a few ways that you can think about why there should be powers of 2 here.

221
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,100
But one that I like is to think about how as you go from that first row to the next one,

222
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,780
it's like the number 1 is sort of donating two copies of itself into the next row.

223
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,640
Likewise, as you go from the second row to the third,

224
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,840
each of those 1s is donating two copies of itself to the next row,

225
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,700
and in general, as you go from one row to the next,

226
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,300
each number donates two copies of itself to the one below.

227
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,420
So as you add up the totals for each of these rows,

228
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,820
it stands to reason that those totals double on each iteration.

229
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,080
Circling back to our original question, think about what this means.

230
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,320
The answer to our question looked like 1 plus n choose 2 plus n choose 4.

231
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,560
In the context of Pascal's triangle, you could think about that as adding up the 0th,

232
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,980
2nd, and 4th terms inside some row of that triangle.

233
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,120
For instance, when n is equal to 5, it looks like adding up 1 plus 10 plus 5.

234
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,980
Now, because each of those numbers is the sum of the two above it,

235
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,040
this is the same thing as adding up the first 5 elements in the previous row,

236
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,080
which in this case is adding up the entire previous row, hence why it's a power of 2.

237
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,720
Same deal for all the numbers that are 5 or less.

238
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,100
When you situate this formula inside Pascal's triangle, and you relate it to the previous row,

239
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,420
what you're doing is adding up the entirety of that previous row.

240
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,040
The point at which this breaks is for n equals 6,

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,180
because in that case, when you relate this to the previous row,

242
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,260
adding up the first 5 elements of that row, it doesn't cover the whole thing.

243
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,100
It falls short specifically by just 1, which is why we miss the power of 2,

244
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,960
and why it falls short specifically by just 1.

245
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,360
Also, notice what happens when we plug in n equals 10.

246
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,160
Looking down at the 10th row, and relating those terms to the previous one,

247
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,060
adding the first 5 elements of the 9th row is exactly half of that row,

248
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,840
and because the triangle is symmetric, this means that when you add them up,

249
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,700
you get exactly half of a power of 2, which itself of course is another power of 2.

250
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,240
And as a challenge problem for you, I don't actually know if this is the last time

251
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,660
you'll ever see a power of 2.

252
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,560
Maybe one of you out there who's cleverer with diaphantine equations than I am

253
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,060
can come up with some clever proof.

254
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,300
Stepping back, to summarize, we started by counting the total number of chords

255
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,360
and the total number of intersection points,

256
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,140
which, by thinking about the right associations, is the same as computing n choose 2 and n choose 4.

257
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,560
Bringing in Euler's formula, this let us get an exact closed form expression

258
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,840
for the number of regions inside the circle.

259
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,560
Then connecting that with Pascal's triangle gives us a very visceral connection

260
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,800
with the powers of 2 and why they break when they do.

261
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,860
So yes, Moser's circle problem is a cautionary tale about being wary of patterns without proof,

262
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,740
but at a deeper level, it also tells us that what's sometimes chalked up to be coincidence

263
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,760
still leaves room for satisfying understandings.
