1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
This is a very famous cautionary tale in math, known as Moser's circle problem.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,930
Some of you may have seen this before, but what I 

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,080
want to do here is really explain what's going on.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,232
The way this starts is we take a circle and put two points on that 

5
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:16,776
circle and connect them with a line, that is a chord of the circle, 

6
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,060
and note that it divides the circle into two different regions.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,013
If I add a third point and then connect that to the previous two points with two 

8
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:29,260
more chords, then these lines all divide the circle into four separate regions.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,057
Then if you add a fourth point and connect that to the previous three, 

10
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:37,763
and you play the same game, you count up how many regions has this cut the circle into, 

11
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:38,940
you end up with eight.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,765
Add a fifth point to the circle, connect it to the previous four, 

13
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:46,674
count up the total number of regions, and if you're careful with your counting, 

14
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:48,140
you'll get a total of sixteen.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,280
Naturally, you can guess what might come next, but would you bet your life on it?

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,402
Add a sixth point, connect it to all the previous ones, 

17
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:58,315
and if you carefully count up all the different regions, 

18
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:02,660
you end up not with the power of two you might have expected, but just one shy of it.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,042
Some of you might be raising your hand saying, 

20
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,960
doesn't it depend on where we put the points?

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,479
For example, watch how this middle region disappears if I 

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,100
place everything nice and symmetrically around the circle.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,216
So yes, it does depend, but we're going to consider the cases 

24
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:20,300
where you never have any three lines intersecting with each other.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,814
This would be the generic case if you just choose n random points, 

26
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:26,600
almost certainly you'll never have three lines coincide, 

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,021
but setting aside the technical nuances, the problem is such a tease, 

28
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:33,540
it looks so convincingly like powers of two until it just barely breaks.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,080
And I have such a strange soft spot for this particular question.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,280
When I was younger I wrote a poem about it and also a song.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,417
And on the one hand it's kind of silly, because this is just one example of what 

32
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:47,595
the mathematician Richard Guy called the strong law of small numbers, 

33
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:51,409
summed up in the phrase, there aren't enough small numbers to meet the many demands 

34
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,000
made of them.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,745
But I think what I really like about this problem is that if you sit down to try 

36
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:00,350
to work out what is the real pattern, what's actually going on here, one, 

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,932
it's just a really good exercise in problem solving, 

38
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:06,780
so it makes for a nice lesson right here, but also it's not just a coincidence 

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,680
that it starts off being powers of two.

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,620
There's a very good reason this happens.

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,032
And it's also not a coincidence that you seemingly randomly hit 

42
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:16,920
another power of two a little bit later on the tenth iteration.

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,300
So we've got this pattern, and what you want to find is what function describes it.

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,952
If you put n points on the boundary of a circle, 

45
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:31,463
and you connect them with all the possible chords, 

46
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:34,466
and you count how many regions the circle has been cut into, 

47
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,780
if the answer isn't a power of two, what is it?

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,660
What function of n should we plug in?

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,267
As always with math, problem solving rule number one if you're stuck is 

50
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:47,140
to try solving easier questions somehow related to the problem at hand.

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,515
It helps you get a foothold, and sometimes those 

52
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,260
answers are helpful in the final question.

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,094
In this case, two warm-up questions that come to mind are, 

54
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:59,898
chords are there in this diagram, and at how many points within the circle do those 

55
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:01,500
chords intersect each other?

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,940
The first question is relatively friendly.

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,840
Every one of those chords corresponds uniquely with a pair of points on the circle.

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,800
So effectively what you want to do is count how many distinct pairs of points are there.

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,980
There's a function that does this, it's called n choose two.

60
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,770
By definition, this counts the number of distinct pairs that 

61
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,340
you can choose from a set of n items, where order doesn't matter.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,203
To calculate it, the way you often think about it is that you have n choices 

63
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:33,460
for what your first item should be, and then you have n minus one options for 

64
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,827
what that second item should be, but simply multiplying those would over count, 

65
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:42,140
since for a given pair you would have two distinct ways to arrive at that pair.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
And remember, we don't care about order.

67
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,420
To account for this, you divide by two.

68
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,258
So for example, seven choose two would look like seven times six divided by two, 

69
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:55,678
which is seven times three, or twenty-one, and if you count up the number 

70
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:59,860
of distinct pairs of seven items, there are indeed twenty-one of them.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,940
Counting the number of intersection points in the diagram is a little bit trickier.

72
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,009
One idea might be that it should be the number of pairs of chords, 

73
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,460
since every intersection point comes from two different chords.

74
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,700
However, that would not quite be right, because the association is not unique.

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,260
You can find a pair of chords that don't intersect within the circle.

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,240
As I said, it's a little bit tricky.

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,674
I'd encourage you to try to pause and think about it for yourself, 

78
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,905
and if you do that, you give yourself a moment, 

79
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:31,160
maybe if you're a little bit lucky, here's one thing you might notice.

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,519
Every intersection point is uniquely associated 

81
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,920
with a quadruplet of points on the exterior.

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,515
For a given quadruplet, you look at the two kind of diagonal chords between them, 

83
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:45,080
and those will intersect within the circle, and it goes the other way around.

84
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,740
Every intersection point corresponds with some quadruplet of points.

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,027
So, what you want now is to count how many distinct 

86
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,460
ways can you choose four items given n total choices.

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,380
This is very similar to the previous question.

88
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,670
The function that answers it is called n choose four, 

89
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,712
which by definition counts the number of quadruplets from a set of size n, 

90
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:11,000
and the way to calculate it is similar to what we saw before.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,180
You would think of having n choices for your first item, 

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,304
leaving you with n minus one choices for the next item, 

93
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:20,485
leaving you with n minus two choices for the third item, 

94
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,940
and n minus three choices for the last item.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,661
That, however, would grossly overcount the total number, 

96
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:31,180
since all the different ways you can permute these four items would be counted separately.

97
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,605
To account for that, you divide out by the extent to which you've overcounted, 

98
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:39,320
the number of permutations of four items, which looks like four factorial.

99
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,366
For example, if you calculate four choose four, everything cancels and you just get one, 

100
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:49,140
and indeed there is a single intersection point in this diagram.

101
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,132
If you calculate six choose four, it works out to be 15, 

102
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,582
and if you look at this diagram and you count them all up, 

103
00:05:56,582 --> 00:06:00,500
you would notice there are indeed 15 different intersection points.

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,379
And even if you would never want to count it up by hand, 

105
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,922
if we had a diagram that has 100 distinct points on the exterior, 

106
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:11,894
and we drew all of the connecting lines, you can conclude that there have 

107
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:15,651
to be 100 choose four, or just about four million intersection points 

108
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,940
somewhere in the middle.

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
You've probably guessed this, but these are more than just warm-up questions.

110
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,600
They give us the necessary information to answer the question we care about.

111
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,980
How many regions has the circle been cut into?

112
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,620
The trick is to use a very nice little fact about planar graphs.

113
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,554
Here I'm using the word graph in the sense of a diagram that has nodes 

114
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:37,980
and lines connecting them, and what it means to be planar is that you 

115
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,700
can draw this diagram without any of the lines intersecting with each other.

116
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,947
In graph theory lingo, you typically call those nodes vertices and the lines connecting 

117
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:51,403
them edges, and the wonderful fact that we can leverage is that if you count up the 

118
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:55,062
number of vertices, and then you subtract the total number of edges, 

119
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:59,518
and then you consider the number of regions that this graph has cut the plane into, 

120
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,223
including that infinite outer region, then always, 

121
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:05,300
no matter what planar graph you started with, you get two.

122
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,800
It's actually very fun.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,780
Try this for yourself.

124
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,982
Draw any graph, make sure the lines don't intersect, 

125
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:14,707
and then count the number of vertices, subtract the number of edges, 

126
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,056
and count the number of regions that it's cut the plane into, 

127
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:22,160
and no matter what diagram you chose, the answer always works out to be two.

128
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,685
More commonly you would see this written as v minus e plus f is equal to two, 

129
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:32,884
since originally the equation described the vertices edges and faces of three-dimensional 

130
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:36,696
polyhedra, and if you want to know why this magical fact is true, 

131
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:40,393
you can think about building up your graph from a trivial case, 

132
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,820
where you have a single node and no edges.

133
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,739
So v would be equal to one, f would also be equal to one because of that 

134
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:51,960
infinite outer region, and e is zero, so the equation is obviously true.

135
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,133
Then if you build up your graph one edge at a time, 

136
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:59,080
one thing that could happen is that for each new edge you introduce a new vertex.

137
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,780
So e goes up by one, but v also goes up by one, leaving the equation balanced.

138
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,639
But if a new edge doesn't correspond to a new vertex, 

139
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,545
meaning it's connecting to a pre-existing vertex, 

140
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:15,847
that means that it's enclosed a new region of space, so e goes up by one, 

141
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:19,800
but f also goes up by one, which again leaves the equation balanced.

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,410
So as you build up some potentially complicated graph, 

143
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,140
v minus e plus f always stays fixed at two.

144
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,904
This equation has a name, it's called Euler's characteristic formula, 

145
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:33,690
and I remember when I made a video about this a while ago, 

146
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,089
I had some dumb joke in there about Euler's being German for beautiful, 

147
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,346
and there were a decent number of comments that were like, you know, 

148
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:43,840
Euler is actually a person, I speak German, and it doesn't mean beautiful.

149
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,826
Anyway, for our purposes, it gives us a tool for counting 

150
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:51,240
the number of regions that a planar graph has cut space into.

151
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,155
Rearranging a little, you would take the number 

152
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,540
of edges minus the number of vertices plus two.

153
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,841
This is exactly the tool that we want to understand our circle question, 

154
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,454
although in that case we don't care about the infinite outer region, 

155
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:07,020
so instead I'll write this as e minus v plus one.

156
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,798
And at first you might complain, but we can't use Euler's formula in this case, 

157
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,881
because it only applies to planar graphs, and in our case the 

158
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,020
lines absolutely intersect with each other.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,720
We even counted how many times they intersect with each other.

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,142
But the key is to treat this as a new graph, where those intersection 

161
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:28,881
points are themselves vertices, so the total number of vertices here would not be n, 

162
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,780
but n plus the n choose 4 total intersection points.

163
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,815
That in turn chops up all of our chords into a larger number of edges, 

164
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:40,310
it's much more than just n choose 2, and initially it might seem really annoying and 

165
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,536
tricky to think about exactly how much it's chopped them up, 

166
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:48,296
but one way you can think about it is that every intersection point takes what started as 

167
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,100
two separate lines and then turns it into four lines.

168
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,540
So in effect, each intersection point adds two more edges.

169
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,965
For example, look at this simple diagram where 

170
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,360
we have three lines and two intersection points.

171
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,580
The total number of edges after the chopping would look like 3 plus 2 times 2, or 7.

172
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,054
If you had four lines that intersected at three separate points, 

173
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:17,340
then the total number of little lines after chopping would be 4 plus 2 times 3, or 10.

174
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,506
And for the diagram we care about, where we started off with n choose 2 separate lines, 

175
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:26,440
and they're getting chopped up at n choose 4 points in the middle, 

176
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,140
you would end up with n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 edges.

177
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,571
And actually there are a few more than that, because we're including the circle, 

178
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:38,560
we also need to count the n different arcs that sit on the outside of this diagram.

179
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,993
So with all of that, you have the information you need to answer the original question, 

180
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:48,064
pulling up our variant of Euler's formula that counts the number of regions, 

181
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,973
plugging in the expression for the number of vertices, 

182
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,722
which is n plus the n choose 4 intersection points, 

183
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:58,005
and you also plug in the slightly larger expression for the new number of edges, 

184
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:02,236
n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 plus n, and the expression has a lot of nice 

185
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:06,096
cancellation, for example you are adding an n but also subtracting an n, 

186
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:10,696
and you're adding two copies of n choose 4 but subtracting another copy of n choose 4, 

187
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:15,244
and when all the dust settles, the answer to the question is 1 plus n choose 2 plus n 

188
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:15,720
choose 4.

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,380
On the one hand, you're done, you answered the question.

190
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,458
I give you one of these circle diagrams with n points on the boundary, 

191
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,820
and using this formula you can figure out how many regions the circle has been cut into.

192
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,200
But of course we're not really done, because that doesn't scratch the itch.

193
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,180
Why is it the case that this looks like powers of 2 and then falls short by just 1?

194
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not just a coincidence, and the key to answering it is to consider Pascal's triangle.

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,379
You know this triangle, it's the one where each term looks 

196
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,559
like a sum of the two different terms above it, 

197
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,920
and there are basically two facts we need to bring in about this triangle.

198
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,836
The first is that every term inside this triangle 

199
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:57,020
looks like n choose k for some value of n and k.

200
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,870
That is, the answer to the question of how many ways can you select a 

201
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,100
subset of size k from a set of size n is visible within this triangle.

202
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,100
The way to think about it is by indexing the rows and columns starting from 0.

203
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,085
For example, if you count up to the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th row, 

204
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:19,100
you count in to the 0, 1, 2, 3rd element, you see 10.

205
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,040
And indeed, 5 choose 3 is equal to 10.

206
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,855
If you've never seen this before and you want to know why it's true, 

207
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:28,720
there's a really lovely argument, I'll leave it up as an exercise.

208
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,958
But moving on to the second thing that we need to know, 

209
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,880
notice what happens when you add up the rows of this triangle.

210
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,642
You get 1, and then 1 plus 1 is 2, 1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4, 

211
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:45,400
1 plus 3 plus 3 plus 1 is 8, and as you continue on, you always get powers of 2.

212
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,160
Maybe at this point you're a little gun-shy about jumping to conclusions about powers of 

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,140
2 too quickly, but in this case it's a genuine pattern, there's no trickery being pulled.

214
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,500
And there are a few ways that you can think about why there should be powers of 2 here.

215
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,608
But one that I like is to think about how as you go from that first row to the next one, 

216
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:07,780
it's like the number 1 is sort of donating two copies of itself into the next row.

217
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,553
Likewise, as you go from the second row to the third, 

218
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:16,123
each of those 1s is donating two copies of itself to the next row, and in general, 

219
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:20,363
as you go from one row to the next, each number donates two copies of itself 

220
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:21,300
to the one below.

221
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,587
So as you add up the totals for each of these rows, 

222
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:27,820
it stands to reason that those totals double on each iteration.

223
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,080
Circling back to our original question, think about what this means.

224
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,320
The answer to our question looked like 1 plus n choose 2 plus n choose 4.

225
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,716
In the context of Pascal's triangle, you could think about that as adding up the 0th, 

226
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,980
2nd, and 4th terms inside some row of that triangle.

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,120
For instance, when n is equal to 5, it looks like adding up 1 plus 10 plus 5.

228
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,597
Now, because each of those numbers is the sum of the two above it, 

229
00:13:55,597 --> 00:14:00,135
this is the same thing as adding up the first 5 elements in the previous row, 

230
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:05,080
which in this case is adding up the entire previous row, hence why it's a power of 2.

231
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,720
Same deal for all the numbers that are 5 or less.

232
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,050
When you situate this formula inside Pascal's triangle, 

233
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,335
and you relate it to the previous row, what you're doing is adding up the entirety 

234
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:16,420
of that previous row.

235
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,067
The point at which this breaks is for n equals 6, because in that case, 

236
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:25,542
when you relate this to the previous row, adding up the first 5 elements of that row, 

237
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,260
it doesn't cover the whole thing.

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,154
It falls short specifically by just 1, which is why we miss the power of 2, 

239
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,960
and why it falls short specifically by just 1.

240
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,360
Also, notice what happens when we plug in n equals 10.

241
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,924
Looking down at the 10th row, and relating those terms to the previous one, 

242
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,889
adding the first 5 elements of the 9th row is exactly half of that row, 

243
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:51,129
and because the triangle is symmetric, this means that when you add them up, 

244
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:55,700
you get exactly half of a power of 2, which itself of course is another power of 2.

245
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,046
And as a challenge problem for you, I don't actually know 

246
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,660
if this is the last time you'll ever see a power of 2.

247
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,705
Maybe one of you out there who's cleverer with diaphantine 

248
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,060
equations than I am can come up with some clever proof.

249
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,132
Stepping back, to summarize, we started by counting the total number of 

250
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,240
chords and the total number of intersection points, which, 

251
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,244
by thinking about the right associations, is the same as computing n choose 

252
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,140
2 and n choose 4.

253
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,706
Bringing in Euler's formula, this let us get an exact closed 

254
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:27,840
form expression for the number of regions inside the circle.

255
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,969
Then connecting that with Pascal's triangle gives us a very visceral 

256
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:35,800
connection with the powers of 2 and why they break when they do.

257
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,616
So yes, Moser's circle problem is a cautionary tale about being wary of patterns 

258
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:45,738
without proof, but at a deeper level, it also tells us that what's sometimes 

259
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:49,860
chalked up to be coincidence still leaves room for satisfying understandings.
