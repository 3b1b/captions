1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
This is a very famous cautionary tale in math, known as Moser's circle problem.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,720
Some of you may have seen this before, but what I want to do here is really explain what's going on.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,360
The way this starts is we take a circle and put two points on that circle

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,120
and connect them with a line, that is a chord of the circle,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,000
and note that it divides the circle into two different regions.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
If I add a third point and then connect that to the previous two points with two more chords,

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,680
then these lines all divide the circle into four separate regions.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,440
Then if you add a fourth point and connect that to the previous three,

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
and you play the same game, you count up how many regions has this cut the circle into,

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,360
you end up with eight.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
Add a fifth point to the circle, connect it to the previous four,

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,560
count up the total number of regions, and if you're careful with your counting,

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,160
you'll get a total of sixteen.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,400
Naturally, you can guess what might come next, but would you bet your life on it?

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,200
Add a sixth point, connect it to all the previous ones,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,840
and if you carefully count up all the different regions,

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,160
you end up not with the power of two you might have expected, but just one shy of it.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
Some of you might be raising your hand saying,

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,920
doesn't it depend on where we put the points?

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,280
For example, watch how this middle region disappears

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,480
if I place everything nice and symmetrically around the circle.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,120
So yes, it does depend, but we're going to consider the cases

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,400
where you never have any three lines intersecting with each other.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,840
This would be the generic case if you just choose n random points,

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,480
almost certainly you'll never have three lines coincide,

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,000
but setting aside the technical nuances, the problem is such a tease,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,760
it looks so convincingly like powers of two until it just barely breaks.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,120
And I have such a strange soft spot for this particular question,

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,560
when I was younger I wrote a poem about it and also a song,

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,760
and on the one hand it's kind of silly because this is just one example

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,680
of what the mathematician Richard Guy called the strong law of small numbers,

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
summed up in the phrase,

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
there aren't enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of them.

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
But I think what I really like about this problem is that

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,080
if you sit down to try to work out what is the real pattern,

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,840
what's actually going on here,

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,480
one, it's just a really good exercise in problem solving,

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,720
so it makes for a nice lesson right here,

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,800
but also it's not just a coincidence that it starts off being powers of two,

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
there's a very good reason this happens,

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,960
and it's also not a coincidence that you seemingly randomly hit another power of two

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,800
a little bit later on the tenth iteration.

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,600
So we've got this pattern,

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,400
and what you want to find is what function describes it.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,120
If you put n points on the boundary of a circle,

46
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
and you connect them with all the possible chords,

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,320
and you count how many regions the circle has been cut into,

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,800
if the answer isn't a power of two, what is it?

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
What function of n should we plug in?

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
As always with math, problem solving rule number one if you're stuck,

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,360
is to try solving easier questions somehow related to the problem at hand.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
It helps you get a foothold,

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,600
and sometimes those answers are helpful in the final question.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,320
In this case, two warm-up questions that come to mind are,

55
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,280
how many total chords are there in this diagram,

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
and at how many points within the circle do those chords intersect each other?

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,240
The first question is relatively friendly,

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,720
every one of those chords corresponds uniquely with a pair of points on the circle.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,600
So effectively what you want to do is count how many distinct pairs of points are there.

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,800
There's a function that does this, it's called n choose two.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
By definition, this counts the number of distinct pairs

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,240
that you can choose from a set of n items, where order doesn't matter.

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,520
To calculate it, the way you often think about it is that you have

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,600
n choices for what your first item should be,

65
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,920
and then you have n minus one options for what that second item should be,

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,160
but simply multiplying those would over count,

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,400
since for a given pair you would have two distinct ways to arrive at that pair.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
And remember, we don't care about order.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,800
To account for this you divide by two.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,760
So for example, seven choose two would look like seven times six divided by two,

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
which is seven times three, or twenty-one,

72
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,360
and if you count up the number of distinct pairs of seven items, there are indeed twenty-one of them.

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
Counting the number of intersection points in the diagram is a little bit trickier.

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
One idea might be that it should be the number of pairs of chords,

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,800
since every intersection point comes from two different chords.

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,960
However, that would not quite be right, because the association is not unique.

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,240
You can find a pair of chords that don't intersect within the circle.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
As I said, it's a little bit tricky.

79
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,440
I'd encourage you to try to pause and think about it for yourself,

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
and if you do that, you give yourself a moment,

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,040
maybe if you're a little bit lucky, here's one thing you might notice.

82
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,960
Every intersection point is uniquely associated with a quadruplet of points on the exterior.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
For a given quadruplet, you look at the two kind of diagonal chords between them,

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
and those will intersect within the circle, and it goes the other way around.

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
Every intersection point corresponds with some quadruplet of points.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
So, what you want now is to count how many distinct ways

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,440
can you choose four items given n total choices.

88
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,640
This is very similar to the previous question.

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,600
The function that answers it is called n choose four,

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
which by definition counts the number of quadruplets from a set of size n,

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,040
and the way to calculate it is similar to what we saw before.

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,920
You would think of having n choices for your first item,

93
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,040
leaving you with n minus one choices for the next item,

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,240
leaving you with n minus two choices for the third item,

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
and n minus three choices for the last item.

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,960
That, however, would grossly overcount the total number,

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,440
since all the different ways you can permute these four items would be counted separately.

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,120
To account for that, you divide out by the extent to which you've overcounted,

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,280
the number of permutations of four items, which looks like four factorial.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,440
For example, if you calculate four choose four, everything cancels and you just get one,

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,040
and indeed, there is a single intersection point in this diagram.

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,200
If you calculate six choose four, it works out to be 15,

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,040
and if you look at this diagram and you count them all up,

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,320
you would notice there are indeed 15 different intersection points.

105
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,760
And even if you would never want to count it up by hand,

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,600
if we had a diagram that has 100 distinct points on the exterior,

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
and we drew all of the connecting lines,

108
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,120
you can conclude that there have to be 100 choose four,

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,800
or just about four million intersection points somewhere in the middle.

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,120
You've probably guessed this, but these are more than just warm-up questions.

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
They give us the necessary information to answer the question we care about.

112
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
How many regions has the circle been cut into?

113
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
The trick is to use a very nice little fact about planar graphs.

114
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,000
Here I'm using the word graph in the sense of a diagram that has nodes and lines connecting them,

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,200
and what it means to be planar is that you can draw this diagram

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,080
without any of the lines intersecting with each other.

117
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,120
In graph theory lingo, you typically call those nodes vertices and the lines connecting them edges,

118
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,760
and the wonderful fact that we can leverage is that if you count up the number of vertices,

119
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,160
and then you subtract the total number of edges,

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,040
and then you consider the number of regions that this graph has cut the plane into,

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,360
including that infinite outer region,

122
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,200
then always, no matter what planar graph you started with, you get two.

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,920
It's actually very fun. Try this for yourself.

124
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,720
Draw any graph, make sure the lines don't intersect, and then count the number of vertices,

125
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,000
subtract the number of edges, and count the number of regions that it's cut the plane into,

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,080
and no matter what diagram you chose, the answer always works out to be two.

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,440
More commonly you would see this written as v minus e plus f is equal to two,

128
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,880
since originally the equation described the vertices, edges, and faces of three-dimensional

129
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,840
polyhedra, and if you want to know why this magical fact is true, you can think about

130
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,200
building up your graph from a trivial case where you have a single node and no edges.

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,040
So v would be equal to one, f would also be equal to one because of that infinite outer region,

132
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,840
and e is zero, so the equation is obviously true.

133
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,560
Then if you build up your graph one edge at a time, one thing that could happen is that

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,360
for each new edge you introduce a new vertex, so e goes up by one, but v also goes up by one,

135
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,160
leaving the equation balanced. But if a new edge doesn't correspond to a new vertex,

136
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,280
meaning it's connecting to a pre-existing vertex, that means that it's enclosed a new region of

137
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,680
space, so e goes up by one, but f also goes up by one, which again leaves the equation balanced.

138
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,360
So as you build up some potentially complicated graph, v minus e plus f always stays fixed at two.

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,840
This equation has a name, it's called Euler's characteristic formula, and I remember when I

140
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,160
made a video about this a while ago I had some dumb joke in there about Euler's being German

141
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,640
for beautiful, and there were a decent number of comments that were like, you know, Euler is

142
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,400
actually a person, I speak German, and it doesn't mean beautiful. Anyway, for our purposes it gives

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,160
us a tool for counting the number of regions that a planar graph has cut space into. Rearranging a

144
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,160
little, you would take the number of edges minus the number of vertices plus two. This is exactly

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
the tool that we want to understand our circle question, although in that case we don't care

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,400
about the infinite outer region, so instead I'll write this as e minus v plus one. And at first you

147
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,360
might complain, but we can't use Euler's formula in this case, because it only applies to planar

148
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,840
graphs, and in our case the lines absolutely intersect with each other. We even counted how

149
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,640
many times they intersect with each other. But the key is to treat this as a new graph where those

150
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,400
intersection points are themselves vertices, so the total number of vertices here would not be n,

151
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,320
but n plus the n choose 4 total intersection points. That in turn chops up all of our chords

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,760
into a larger number of edges, it's much more than just n choose 2, and initially it might seem really

153
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,320
annoying and tricky to think about exactly how much it's chopped them up, but one way you can

154
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,600
think about it is that every intersection point takes what started as two separate lines and then

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,560
turns it into four lines. So in effect each intersection point adds two more edges. For

156
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,320
example look at this simple diagram where we have three lines and two intersection points. The total

157
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,960
number of edges after the chopping would look like three plus two times two, or seven. If you had four

158
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,440
lines that intersected at three separate points then the total number of little lines after

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,680
chopping would be four plus two times three, or ten. And for the diagram we care about where we

160
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,200
started off with n choose two separate lines and they're getting chopped up at n choose four points

161
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,200
in the middle, you would end up with n choose two plus two times n choose four edges. And actually

162
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
there are a few more than that, because we're including the circle we also need to count the

163
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,200
n different arcs that sit on the outside of this diagram. So with all of that you have the

164
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,280
information you need to answer the original question. Pulling up our variant of Euler's

165
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,760
formula that counts the number of regions we'll plug in the expression for the number of vertices

166
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,800
which is n plus the n choose four intersection points, and you also plug in the slightly larger

167
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,920
expression for the new number of edges n choose two plus two times n choose four plus n, and the

168
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,400
expression has a lot of nice cancellation, for example you are adding an n but also subtracting

169
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,760
an n and you're adding two copies of n choose four but subtracting another copy of n choose four

170
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,360
and when all the dust settles the answer to the question is one plus n choose two plus n choose

171
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,960
four. On the one hand you're done you answered the question. I give you one of these circle

172
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,320
diagrams with n points on the boundary and using this formula you can figure out how many regions

173
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,880
the circle has been cut into. But of course we're not really done because that doesn't scratch the

174
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,480
itch. Why is it the case that this looks like powers of two and then falls short by just one?

175
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,040
It's not just a coincidence and the key to answering it is to consider Pascal's triangle.

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,840
You know this triangle, it's the one where each term looks like a sum of the two different terms

177
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,360
above it and there are basically two facts we need to bring in about this triangle. The first is that

178
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,240
every term inside this triangle looks like n choose k for some value of n and k. That is the

179
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,320
answer to the question of how many ways can you select a subset of size k from a set of size n

180
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,200
is visible within this triangle. The way to think about it is by indexing the rows and columns

181
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,640
starting from zero. For example if you count up to the 0 1 2 3 4 5th row and you count in to the 0 1

182
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:24,000
2 3rd element you see 10 and indeed 5 choose 3 is equal to 10. If you've never seen this before and

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,120
you want to know why it's true there's a really lovely argument. I'll leave it up as an exercise

184
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,080
but moving on to the second thing that we need to know. Notice what happens when you add up the rows

185
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:42,480
of this triangle. You get 1 and then 1 plus 1 is 2, 1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4, 1 plus 3 plus 3 plus 1 is 8

186
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,000
and as you continue on you always get powers of 2. Maybe at this point you're a little gun shy about

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,640
jumping to conclusions about powers of 2 too quickly but in this case it's a genuine pattern.

188
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,040
There's no trickery being pulled and there are a few ways that you can think about why there

189
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,160
should be powers of 2 here. The one that I like is to think about how as you go from that first row

190
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,680
to the next one it's like the number 1 is sort of donating two copies of itself into the next row.

191
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,520
Likewise as you go from the second row to the third each of those ones is donating two copies

192
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,200
of itself to the next row and in general as you go from one row to the next each number donates

193
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,040
two copies of itself to the one below. So as you add up the totals for each of these rows it stands

194
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,800
to reason that those totals double on each iteration. Circling back to our original question

195
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,560
think about what this means. The answer to our question looked like 1 plus n choose 2 plus n

196
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,560
choose 4. In the context of Pascal's triangle you could think about that as adding up the 0th,

197
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,400
2nd and 4th terms inside some row of that triangle. For instance when n is equal to 5 it

198
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:55,360
looks like adding up 1 plus 10 plus 5. Now because each of those numbers is the sum of the two above

199
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,960
it this is the same thing as adding up the first five elements in the previous row which in this

200
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,320
case is adding up the entire previous row hence why it's a power of 2. Same deal for all the

201
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,920
numbers that are 5 or less. When you situate this formula inside Pascal's triangle and you relate it

202
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,840
to the previous row what you're doing is adding up the entirety of that previous row. The point at

203
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,200
which this breaks is for n equals 6 because in that case when you relate this to the previous row

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,400
adding up the first five elements of that row it doesn't cover the whole thing. It falls short

205
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,320
specifically by just one which is why we miss the power of 2 and why it falls short specifically by

206
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,080
just one. Also notice what happens when we plug in n equals 10. Looking down at the 10th row and

207
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,360
relating those terms to the previous one adding the first five elements of the ninth row is

208
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,880
exactly half of that row and because the triangle is symmetric this means that when you add them up

209
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,600
you get exactly half of a power of 2 which itself of course is another power of 2.

210
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,320
And as a challenge problem for you I don't actually know if this is the last time that

211
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,000
you'll ever see a power of 2. Maybe one of you out there who's cleverer with

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,040
diaphantine equations than I am can come up with some clever proof.

213
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,320
Stepping back to summarize we started by counting the total number of chords and the total number of

214
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
intersection points which by thinking about the right associations is the same as computing n

215
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,120
choose 2 and n choose 4. Bringing in Euler's formula this let us get an exact closed form

216
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,080
expression for the number of regions inside the circle. Then connecting that with Pascal's

217
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,600
triangle gives us a very visceral connection with the powers of 2 and why they break when they do.

218
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,120
So yes, Moser's circle problem is a cautionary tale about being wary of patterns without proof

219
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,080
but at a deeper level it also tells us that what's sometimes chalked up to be coincidence

220
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,520
still leaves room for satisfying understandings.
