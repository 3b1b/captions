00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
I have mixed feelings about shorts.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,623
On the one hand, lots of individual shorts are 

3
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:07,060
insightful and funny and even awe-inspiring.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,101
And let's be real, long-form videos on YouTube can often be 

5
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:13,300
bloated and shorts are necessarily to the point, so I get the appeal.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,927
At the same time, no one I know seems to actually feel good 

7
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:20,380
after a long session on shorts, or reels or TikTok or whatever.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,587
Something about the rapid barrage of instant gratification 

9
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:26,600
and context switching seems to leave us feeling mentally numb.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,320
Recently, I've been posting a pile of shorts that 

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,040
are all adapted snippets from pre-existing videos.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,021
And it's not just that this is the easiest way to get into the shorts feed, 

13
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:39,280
readily outsourceable while I stay focused on new long-form lessons.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,500
The second ulterior motive is to offer an escape hatch.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,537
A good short is one that's thought-provoking on its own, 

16
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:49,090
but unless there's a way to more deeply engage with whatever that thought is, 

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,820
it feels hollow.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,579
Since we can so nicely link to other videos right at the bottom of a short, 

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,239
I kind of love the idea that anyone who wants to hop out of the 

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,360
feed and engage more deeply is just one click away.
