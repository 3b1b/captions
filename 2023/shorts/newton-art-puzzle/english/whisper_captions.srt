Here's an art puzzle that feels impossible but is secretly related to some deep math.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,060
Try creating a picture that has at least three colors, so that any point that's on the

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,140
boundary of one color is on the boundary of all of them.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,580
So for example in this diagram with red, green, and blue, the middle point is on the boundary

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,220
of all three colors, so it's fine, but this whole line of points here is disallowed, since

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,800
they're all on the boundary of red and green, but not blue.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,460
Likewise these other two border lines are disallowed.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,140
So maybe you try to correct that, you go and add a bunch of blue blobs on the boundary

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,480
of the red and green, and do something similar on the other border lines, but now the smaller

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,520
boundaries of those blobs would cause a problem, so maybe you try to correct that even further

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,060
and keep iterating and iterating.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,700
This might feel impossible, and with smooth shapes it is, but there are actually infinitely

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,500
many solutions.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,140
One example is a family of figures known as Newton fractals.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,220
What's very fun is that the diagrams are closely tied to a kind of chaos, a chaos that emerges

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,440
from a common algorithm that's used all over the place in engineering to find numerical

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,520
solutions to equations.
