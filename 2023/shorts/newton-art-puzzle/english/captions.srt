00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
Here's an art puzzle that feels impossible but is secretly related to some deep math.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,647
Try creating a picture that has at least three colors, 

3
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:12,140
so that any point that's on the boundary of one color is on the boundary of all of them.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,369
So for example in this diagram with red, green, and blue, 

5
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:18,587
the middle point is on the boundary of all three colors, so it's fine, 

6
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:20,853
but this whole line of points here is disallowed, 

7
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:23,800
since they're all on the boundary of red and green, but not blue.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,460
Likewise these other two border lines are disallowed.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,893
So maybe you try to correct that, you go and add a bunch of blue blobs on the 

10
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:33,546
boundary of the red and green, and do something similar on the other border lines, 

11
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:36,582
but now the smaller boundaries of those blobs would cause a problem, 

12
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:40,060
so maybe you try to correct that even further and keep iterating and iterating.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,210
This might feel impossible, and with smooth shapes it is, 

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,500
but there are actually infinitely many solutions.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,140
One example is a family of figures known as Newton fractals.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,982
What's very fun is that the diagrams are closely tied to a kind of chaos, 

17
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:56,071
a chaos that emerges from a common algorithm that's used all over 

18
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:59,160
the place in engineering to find numerical solutions to equations.
