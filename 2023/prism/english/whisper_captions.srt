1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
I realized recently that I didn't really understand how a prism works, and I suspect

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,260
most people out there don't either.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,180
Arguably this is one of the most widely recognized physics experiments ever.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,220
After all, how many others have earned a place as an iconic album cover?

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,880
Sure, some of Pink Floyd's design choices run completely contrary to the actual physics.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,100
Like why did they make the light inside the prism white?

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,220
And bafflingly, why would you draw all the colors as a discrete set, like a child making

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,240
a rainbow, despite the fact that one of the key points in Newton's original experiment

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,200
involving prisms was that sunlight contains a continuous spectrum of colors?

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,900
Still, setting that aside, it's cool that it's in pop culture at all, and any self-respecting

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,820
physics enthusiast should know how it works, but the thing I realized is that my understanding

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,900
hit a wall pretty quickly if pressed.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,260
You see, the standard explanation, what you might hear in a high school physics class

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,620
for example, goes something like this.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,260
When light enters a medium, like glass, it slows down, in the sense that if you look

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,160
at the crests of the wave, in a vacuum those crests are travelling at c, the speed of light,

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,060
but inside the glass those crests will be travelling a little bit slower.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,520
And the specific ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed inside a medium

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,460
like this is called the index of refraction for that medium.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,780
The reason we use the word refraction instead of, say, the index of slowing, is that if

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,100
a beam of light enters this glass at an angle, then a consequence of this slowdown is that

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,180
it bends a little bit, or using the lingo, it refracts.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,340
And the way my high school physics teacher always explained this was to imagine a tank

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,800
going from some region where it can travel relatively quickly, like concrete, into something

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,060
slower, like mud, where if it's coming in at an angle, then as one of its treads hits

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,500
the slow region first, that tread will be going slower while the other one is faster,

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,760
causing the whole thing to steer a little bit, until that second tread also enters the

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,000
mud, then it continues straight, just travelling a little slower.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,580
We'll get back to the actual reason for bending in a bit, but at this point the high

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,000
school physics students typically learn a law known as Snell's law, which specifies

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,740
exactly how much things bend.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,660
If you draw a line perpendicular to the boundary between the glass and water, and consider

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,060
the angle between that perpendicular line and the beam of light, then Snell's law

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,160
tells us that the sine of this angle divided by the speed of the light is always a constant.

35
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,140
So the slower the light, the lower that angle will be, and that lets you actually calculate

36
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,320
how much things refract.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,980
What's going on with a prism, then, is that the specific amount that light slows down

38
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,140
depends a little bit on its frequency.

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,640
For example, blue light, which has a relatively high frequency, would get slowed down more

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,120
aggressively than red light, which has a relatively low frequency.

41
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,000
Now most of the light that you see is not a clean pure sine wave, in particular the

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,260
white light coming from the sun is not a clean sine wave, it's something much messier,

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,880
but it can be expressed as a sum of a bunch of clean sine waves, each one corresponding

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,700
to a pure spectral color.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,060
So when you shine white light into a prism like this, all those different components

46
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,980
get refracted by slightly different amounts, causing this iconic separation of the pure

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,920
rainbow colors.

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,460
So that is the standard explanation, and it's not wrong per se, it's just that all of

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,060
the key components are handed down from on high.

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Why would light slow down like this?

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,240
And what exactly do we mean by slowing down?

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,760
And even if you understand that, why would the amount that it slows down have anything

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,980
to do with the color of the light?

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
Is that just a coincidence, or is it necessary?

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
If you have a sufficiently high standard for explanations, you want both of these facts

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,320
to feel discovered, rather than feeling like they were handed down.

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,760
The first explanation I saw that started to give this feeling came from the Feynman lectures

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,940
on the matter, and a lot of what I'd like to do with this video is simply animate a

59
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,660
lot of the key points that he makes there.

60
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,660
It involves really digging in to think about each individual wiggling charge in the material,

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,940
and the propagating light waves caused by each one of those charges, and how all of

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,140
them superimpose on top of each other.

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,960
Which feels like it should be a complete mess, but it actually works out to be not only understandable,

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,220
but satisfyingly explanatory.

65
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,320
For example, it explains why it has to depend on color, and the key intuition there really

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,040
comes down to what happens if you're bad at pushing a child on a swing.

67
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,520
Bear with me, I promise that'll make sense later.

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,780
Also, when I mentioned on Patreon the intention to cover this topic, a lot of people had a

69
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,920
lot of questions about the index of refraction.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,260
For example, numerous people asked about how it's possible for this number to be lower

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,640
than 1, which really does happen, despite that seeming to imply the impossibility of

72
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,860
something traveling faster than the speed of light.

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,540
There was also a question about birefringence, which is where a material can have two different

74
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,180
indices of refraction, causing you to c-double when you look through it.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,920
And that actually ties in really nicely to putting in the final puzzle piece from the

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,620
last two videos about the barber pole phenomenon.

77
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,960
And a couple people also asked about why light slowing down would imply a bending like this,

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,340
and I agree that deserves a better explanation than the tank analogy.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,860
I promise we'll get to all of these questions later, but it makes sense to first lay down

80
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,000
some groundwork by spending the bulk of our time on the key question of why passing through

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
a medium would change the speed of a light wave at all.

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,020
And for this, I want you to think of your material, like glass, as being broken up into

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,680
a bunch of distinct layers, all perpendicular to the direction the light is traveling.

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,840
And we'll start by focusing our attention on the effect of just one of those layers

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,760
on the light wave.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,980
The true effect would be miniscule, but if you'll let me exaggerate it for a moment,

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,560
what it does is kick back the phase of the wave.

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,620
And maybe it's worth a brief aside to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes

89
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,600
to wave terminology.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,380
If you go and graph the function sine of x, when you put some term in front of it, affecting

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,440
how high that wave oscillates up and down, that's what we call the amplitude, when you

92
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,580
put a term in front of x, this will affect how rapidly it oscillates.

93
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,500
If this is meant to describe a wave over time, that term would be called the angular frequency,

94
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,180
whereas if it's meant to describe a wave over space, that constant would be called the wave

95
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,540
number.

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,100
Then if you were to add some other constant inside that sine function, and notice how

97
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,840
as you change what that constant is, it sort of slides the wave left and right, that term

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,700
describes the phase of the wave.

99
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,720
So when I say that our light wave hitting a layer of glass causes its phase to get kicked

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,940
back, I mean if you take whatever function describes it before it hits the glass, then

101
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,180
the function describing it after that looks almost the same, just with a little extra

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,740
something added to the input of that sine function.

103
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Like I said, in reality that'll be a very small number, something proportional to the

104
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,260
infinitesimal thickness of that layer, but I'll keep drawing it as something exaggerated

105
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,000
and keep track of the value of that phase kick over here on the left.

106
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,700
Let's say you go and add a bunch of other layers of the glass, each one also applying

107
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,940
their own kickback to the phase of the wave.

108
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,840
The question for you is what does that new wave look like?

109
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,200
If the value of that phase kick applied by each layer is something really close to zero,

110
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,280
then the wave is hardly affected at all.

111
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,860
But the larger that phase kick, the more the wave kind of gets squished together among

112
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,780
all those layers.

113
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,380
Admittedly, right here it looks all kaleidoscopic and weird, but that's really just because

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,340
I have a discrete set of layers, each applying an unrealistically large kick.

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,540
Notice what happens if I smooth it out by doubling the density of layers, but having

116
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,540
each one only apply half the phase kick.

117
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,600
And then I do that again, I double the density of the layers, but have each one only apply

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
half the phase kick.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,480
As I continue this over and over, approaching a situation where you have a continuum of

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,660
glass, each layer applying just a tiny infinitesimal phase kick, what you end up with is identical

121
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,400
to, indistinguishable from, a wave that's simply traveling slower, oscillating up and

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,480
down with the same frequency, but with a wavelength that's been kind of scrunched up.

123
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,080
This right here is the first key idea with the index of refraction.

124
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,620
Instead of asking why does light slow down in glass, what we really need to ask is why

125
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,720
does its interaction with a single layer of that glass cause a kickback to the phase

126
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,400
of the wave?

127
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,180
And then when we want to get quantitative and understand exactly how much the light

128
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,640
slows down, which is critical for understanding why it depends on color, instead the real

129
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,740
question is how strong is that phase kick?

130
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,960
From here it's helpful to turn back to the fundamentals of what light even is.

131
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,560
This is something we talked a lot about in the last video, but a little review never

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,280
hurts, so let me go over the essentials.

133
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,160
As many of you know, light is a wave in the electromagnetic field, but here we'll just

134
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,680
be drawing the electric field.

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,060
The electric field associates each point in 3D space with a little 3-dimensional vector

136
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,620
telling you what force would be applied to a hypothetical unit charge sitting at that

137
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,560
point in space.

138
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,980
The key thing going on with light is that if you have a charged particle and something

139
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,920
causes it to wiggle up and down, that results in these propagating ripples in the electric

140
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,800
field away from the charge, and that propagation is traveling at the speed c, the speed of

141
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,140
light.

142
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,520
Whenever those ripples happen to reach another charged particle, they cause it to wiggle

143
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,320
up and down, albeit a little more weakly than the initial wiggle, and that in turn causes

144
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,520
its own propagations.

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,500
The way we described this in the last video was that if at some point in time a charge

146
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,920
is accelerating, then after a little delay, which depends on this speed c, the existence

147
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,980
of that acceleration induces a force on another charge.

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,360
We went over the specific force law describing this, it's something that can be derived

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,300
downstream of Maxwell's equations, but for our purposes here, the main thing to tuck

150
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,900
away in your mind is that the amount of time it takes that initial acceleration to cause

151
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,840
any kind of influence elsewhere travels at exactly the speed c.

152
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,680
And really, you should think of c not so much as the speed of light per se, but as the speed

153
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,620
of causality.

154
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,620
It determines how fast any kind of influence travels, it's just that one of multiple

155
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,260
consequences of that is that it's the speed of light.

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,400
In particular, when you get a charge oscillating up and down in a nice clean sinusoidal motion,

157
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,800
you can think of these rippling effects in the electric field as describing the force

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,680
that would be applied to another charge sitting there as a result of that past acceleration.

159
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,180
I will freely admit that I had a bit too much fun in that video just simulating how the

160
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:34,760
electric field responds to accelerating charges, but there are two important facts for our

161
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,400
pursuit of the index of refraction.

162
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,800
The first is that when you have multiple different charges oscillating up and down, the net effect

163
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,880
on the electric field is just the sum of what it would be for each individual charge, which

164
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,180
is kind of what you would expect.

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,060
The way it shakes out is that if you have a row of charges oscillating in sync with

166
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,180
each other, or for our purposes today, a plane of charges all wiggling up and down

167
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,860
in sync within that plane, then the effects of each individual charge tend to cancel each

168
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,220
other out in most directions, except perpendicular to that plane, they actually constructively

169
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,720
interfere.

170
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,560
This is how you can get a concentrated beam of light.

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,860
That's the important thing.

172
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,640
If you have a layer of charges wiggling up and down in sync with each other, then even

173
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,260
far away from that layer, it produces this nice sinusoidal wave in the electric field

174
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,900
that we're so fond of drawing to represent light.

175
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,480
When I draw a light wave like this, it's really only depicting the electric field on

176
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,980
a single one-dimensional line.

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,640
A more full picture of light in three dimensions would look something more like this.

178
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,340
That tends to be a little bit busier, so usually we just draw the sine wave.

179
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,620
So thinking back to the question of why interactions with a layer of material would cause a case

180
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,540
of the phase of the wave, let's start thinking it through.

181
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,420
When a light beam enters a material, like glass, then it causes all of the charges inside

182
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,300
that material, you know, electrons or maybe the occasional ion, to wiggle up and down

183
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,940
in response to that light wave.

184
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,460
You might think that adding together all the propagations from all those charges is a complete

185
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,620
nightmare, but we can think about it one layer at a time.

186
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,620
As the light wave causes this layer to wiggle up and down, that wiggling produces its own

187
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,400
second-order light wave at the same frequency, and it propagates in both directions perpendicular

188
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,300
to that layer.

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,680
The overall electric field, then, looks like the initial incoming light wave added together

190
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,040
with the second-order wave.

191
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,960
By far the most distracting part of what's going on here is everything on the left, and

192
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,600
this actually corresponds to the light being reflected back.

193
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,020
And from experience, you all know that when you look at water or you look at glass, light

194
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,860
not only goes through it, but some of it gets reflected back.

195
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,000
And we could have a whole interesting discussion on quantifying exactly how much, but in the

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
spirit of staying focused, we will completely ignore that for today and only focus on what's

197
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,860
happening to the right of that layer.

198
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,200
You can probably predict what I'm going to say.

199
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,420
It turns out that when you add that second-order oscillation, the overall effect is almost

200
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,900
identical to the incoming light, but just shifted back in phase by a little bit.

201
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,840
And then because many successive shifts to the phase like this are the same thing as

202
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,640
light slowing down, this will ultimately explain the index of refraction.

203
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,020
But of course the sufficiently curious viewers will now be raising their hands and asking,

204
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
why is that the effect when you add them together?

205
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
And so here it might be worth a little sidebar on how to think about adding two waves together.

206
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,640
If you draw some sine wave with some particular amplitude, some specific frequency, and some

207
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,620
specific phase, and then you draw another sine wave, also with its own amplitude, frequency,

208
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,120
and phase, in general it's very hard to think about what the sum of those two waves

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,480
should look like as you tweak those initial parameters.

210
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,640
In the specific case where the frequencies are the same, which is true for our example,

211
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,580
the result will also look like a sine wave with that same frequency.

212
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,920
But even then it's a little tricky to think about exactly how to describe that wave.

213
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,600
It has some amplitude and some phase, and if I ask you to concretely compute both of

214
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,560
those numbers based on the amplitudes and phases of the initial waves, it's not immediately

215
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,520
clear how you would do that without throwing a bunch of trig identities at the problem.

216
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,140
But here's a really nice way to think about it.

217
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,860
Imagine that first wave describes the y component of some rotating vector.

218
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,300
The length of that vector corresponds with the amplitude of our wave, and then the initial

219
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,000
rotation of that vector corresponds with the phase of our wave.

220
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,900
Similarly, think of the second wave as describing the y component of another rotating vector,

221
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,000
where the amplitude corresponds with the length of that vector, and the phase of the wave

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,380
tells us the initial angle of that vector.

223
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,880
Now to think about the sum of the two waves, just think about adding those two vectors

224
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,720
tip to tail.

225
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,320
And because they both have the same frequency as both of them rotate, their sum rotates

226
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,740
in lockstep with them.

227
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,520
So if you want to think about the amplitude of our resulting wave, it comes down to the

228
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,120
length of this vector sum, and similarly the phase corresponds to the angle of that vector

229
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,460
sum.

230
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,380
In some cases this tells you things that you probably already knew, like if the two phases

231
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,520
happen to be the same, then you get constructive interference and you have a bigger wave that

232
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,920
results.

233
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,400
And if the phases were 180 degrees out of sync, then you get deconstructive interference

234
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,440
with a relatively small resulting wave.

235
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,680
What's a little bit less obvious, but what's crucial for our discussion here, is that if

236
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,780
the phase of that second wave happens to be exactly 90 degrees behind the phase of the

237
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,600
first, so kind of a quarter cycle out of sync, and if that second wave is also very small

238
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,200
compared to the first, then if you look at the little vector sum on the lower left, you'll

239
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,220
notice how this means that the resulting wave is almost identical to the initial wave, but

240
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,080
has just shifted back in its phase by a tiny bit.

241
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,360
Moreover, the size of that phase shift depends on the specific amplitude of that second wave.

242
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,100
So looking back at our previous animation, where we have some wiggling charges in a layer

243
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,880
of glass causing these second order propagations that need to be added together with the incoming

244
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,400
light, the way it works out is that the phase of that second wave is exactly a quarter of

245
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,580
a cycle behind the phase of the first.

246
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,760
So when you add them together, you get this little phase shift.

247
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,420
And then, critically, the size of that phase shift is bigger when that second order wave

248
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,240
is larger, and then smaller when that second order wave is smaller.

249
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,280
Again, the very curious viewers will be raising their hands and saying, why does it work out

250
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,460
to be exactly a quarter of a cycle behind?

251
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,700
There is a very nice reason, but it's just a little too much detail for us today.

252
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,360
If you're curious, I highly encourage you to take a look at the Feynman lectures on

253
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,720
the matter.

254
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,380
For our purposes, step back for a second and think about what you need to explain the key

255
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,320
question of prisms, which is why the index of refraction would depend on color at all.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,520
As you now know, that index depends on how much each layer of glass kicks back the phase

257
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,760
of the wave, and that phase kick depends on the strength of the second order wave resulting

258
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,580
from charge oscillations in a layer of that glass.

259
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,600
So you need to drill in and understand exactly how much those charges wiggle in response

260
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,960
to an incoming light wave.

261
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,060
So let's zoom in on that layer and think of each one of those charged particles, and

262
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,340
even though the specific molecular structure is going to be something very complicated,

263
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,380
we're going to model each one of those charges as if it was bound to some equilibrium position

264
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,080
by a spring, or maybe a set of springs.

265
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,740
I don't mean this literally, of course, I just mean if we describe the displacement

266
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,440
of this charge from its equilibrium with a little vector x that's going to depend on

267
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,260
time, then in our model, the force applied to the charge, pulling it back to that equilibrium,

268
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,920
is going to be something proportional to the size of that displacement, with a little proportionality

269
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,840
constant k.

270
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,440
This is the same law that governs how springs work.

271
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,800
You might ask if that's accurate, and the idea is that for very small displacements,

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,820
it's actually a really good approximation.

273
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,740
This is a very common thing to do throughout physics, we would call it a linear restoring

274
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,140
force.

275
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,820
The idea is that maybe the actual force law depends on the position in a much more complicated

276
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,760
way, but we're basically taking a low order approximation near the equilibrium.

277
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,280
If I just run this as a simulation, plugging in this force law, here's what that displacement

278
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
looks like as a function of time.

279
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,760
What you get looks like a sine wave, this is called simple harmonic motion, and the

280
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,600
frequency of this wave is going to matter a lot for you and me, and finding that comes

281
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,200
down to solving a certain differential equation, because the force is really the same thing

282
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,440
as mass times acceleration, and the acceleration is the same thing as the second derivative

283
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,880
of that displacement.

284
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,660
So what we're saying is we want some function whose second derivative looks like a certain

285
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,740
constant times that function itself.

286
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,000
Any differential equation students among you might enjoy thinking about how you solve this.

287
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,460
I won't go over the full details, but the answer is reasonably intuitive, and anyone

288
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,760
who knows a little calculus can just check it for themselves.

289
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,380
The way it shakes out is that if the initial condition is that our little charge has a

290
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,420
velocity of zero, but it's offset from the equilibrium by a little vector x-naught, then

291
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,340
the way it evolves over time looks like x-naught multiplied by a cosine expression.

292
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,680
So the amplitude of this wave is kind of uninteresting, it just depends on how far we pulled things

293
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,620
back originally, but the meet is this frequency term, square root of k divided by m.

294
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,620
And if you think about it, this should hopefully be at least a little intuitive.

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,800
For example, if you increase k, which is kind of like increasing the strength of that spring,

296
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,540
then it results in a faster oscillation.

297
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,700
Whereas if you increase m, the mass of the particle, there's a lot more inertia and it

298
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,360
results in a slower oscillation.

299
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,200
This term, square root of k divided by m, has a special name, it's called the resonant

300
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,740
frequency for our simple harmonic oscillator.

301
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,640
And being a little more precise, I should call this the resonant angular frequency.

302
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,580
This is always a little bit of an awkwardness with physics, where whenever you have some

303
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,960
kind of cyclic process, when you give an intuitive description, it's natural to phrase things

304
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,380
in terms of the frequency, the number of cycles that this process makes per unit time.

305
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,600
But when doing math, it's often more natural to talk about the angular frequency, which

306
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,520
you could think of as describing how much angle this process covers in radians per unit

307
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:25,900
time.

308
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,920
It's just the same as the frequency, but multiplied by 2 pi.

309
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,020
So for example, if you have something like a cosine expression, which you might think

310
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,520
of as describing the x component of a cycling vector like this, then the term sitting right

311
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,020
in front of the t in that cosine is the angular frequency.

312
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,880
This is why angular frequency makes the math a little cleaner.

313
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,880
For example, in our simple harmonic motion, the term sitting in front of t looks like

314
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,720
the square root of k divided by m, which I'm writing as omega sub r.

315
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,440
Let's package all of that up and call that our solution in the simple case, where there's

316
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,120
no external force acting on our charged particle.

317
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,000
But of course, what we're interested in is what happens when you shine a beam of light

318
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,120
on this material, which intuitively causes this charge to jiggle, but the question is

319
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,700
how much.

320
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,620
In our equation, this looks like adding a new force term corresponding to the light

321
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:14,920
wave.

322
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,460
That force oscillates up and down, also according to some kind of cosine function, but this

323
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,480
time with a distinct angular frequency, that I'm going to call omega sub l.

324
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,220
E naught here describes the strength of the wave, and then q describes the charge of whatever

325
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,180
particle we're modeling.

326
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,980
As usual, it's a lot easier to think about when we only draw a subset of that light wave,

327
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,400
and in this case we're going to draw it on the plane of the layer of material we care

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,700
about.

329
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,860
You might think of gusts of wind blowing our little ball on the spring up and down in a

330
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,220
clean sinusoidal pattern.

331
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,120
Or as another analogy, it's similar to pushing a child on a swing.

332
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,100
The swing would oscillate on its own due to the force of gravity, but you as the pusher

333
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,500
are applying an external force which itself is oscillating over time.

334
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,780
Although a key difference here is that the frequency of that external force in general

335
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,220
has nothing to do with the resonant frequency of that little oscillator.

336
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,100
The better analogy would be if you're pushing the child on the swing with a cyclic force

337
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,560
that has nothing to do with what the swing naturally wants to do.

338
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,400
And my favorite part in literally trying to do this with my niece is that at some point

339
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,000
she gently murmurs to herself, this isn't how mom does it.

340
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,200
Now, in trying to understand how much our charge is oscillating in response to the incoming

341
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,760
light, let me start by just simulating it and plotting the result.

342
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,340
You'll notice that there's a little startup period where it kind of has to get going,

343
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,040
but then after that, mercifully, it looks nice and clean, just like another sine wave.

344
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,700
Now you might be thinking, yeah, yeah, everything is sine waves, but it's important to understand

345
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,420
that this one has a very different character from the sine wave we saw earlier.

346
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,560
Earlier, without any external forces, the frequency of that wave came down to the spring

347
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,840
constant and the mass, which is to say it depends exclusively on material properties

348
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
of the glass.

349
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,060
By contrast, with this external cycling driving force, the frequency in that steady state

350
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,780
is the same as the frequency of the light.

351
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
And then in our first case, the amplitude of the wave was kind of uninteresting, it

352
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,360
just depends on how far you pulled the spring out to begin with.

353
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,800
But in the second case, the amplitude of this wave is actually where all the interesting

354
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,640
stuff happens.

355
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,480
Exactly how much will this charge be oscillating in response to the light wave?

356
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,040
Again, I won't go over the full details of solving this, but any eager calculus students

357
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,060
among you might enjoy going through the exercise where if you just guess that a solution looks

358
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,160
like a cosine wave with the same frequency as the light, and you solve for the amplitude,

359
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,860
you can get a concrete solution to this equation that looks like this.

360
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,960
This is worth unpacking for a bit, and just to be clear, this is only describing things

361
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,460
in the steady state, after things have gotten up and going.

362
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,000
A fully descriptive solution would be notably more complicated.

363
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,020
As I said, everything interesting here comes down to the amplitude, which here looks like

364
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,000
a large collection of constants, most of which should be pretty intuitive if you take

365
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,060
a moment to think about it.

366
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,600
For example, it is proportional to the strength of that incoming light wave, so the stronger

367
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
the light the more the oscillations.

368
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,580
It's also proportional to the charge, which again makes sense.

369
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,640
And the real heart of the matter comes down to what's sitting in the denominator here,

370
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,140
the difference between the square of the resonant frequency and the square of the light frequency.

371
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,060
And to build a little intuition, take a moment to think about what would happen if the frequency

372
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,140
of the incoming light was something very close to the resonant frequency of this oscillator.

373
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,660
This is analogous to the normal situation pushing a child on a swing, where the frequency

374
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,860
of your force lines up quite closely with what the swing wants to do.

375
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,460
In this case, running the simulation, notice how the oscillations of that particle will

376
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,040
grow and grow and grow, becoming quite large over time.

377
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,680
Some of you may know the famous example of the Millennium Bridge in London, where on

378
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,040
its opening day it started oscillating way more than the engineers expected it to.

379
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,440
And what was going on is that the frequency of the steps of the crowd lined up very closely

380
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,580
with a resonant frequency, causing this worryingly high amplitude.

381
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,300
By contrast, notice what happens in the simulation if the frequency of the light, ωL, is something

382
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,320
much smaller than the resonant frequency.

383
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,940
For this particular simulation it takes a little bit of a moment before things get into

384
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,920
their full swing, eventually it finds a nice sinusoidal motion, but the amplitude of that

385
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,220
motion is much more modest in comparison.

386
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,260
So what our equation is telling us is that the larger the difference between those frequencies,

387
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,080
then the bigger the denominator, so the smaller the overall wiggle to that charge.

388
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,540
And again, this is something you can see in the footage with my niece.

389
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,680
As I'm applying a force with a frequency that's very different from what the swing

390
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,560
wants to do, she ends up oscillating at the same frequency as my force, but she's going

391
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,180
at a relatively low amplitude.

392
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,260
Stepping back, what this means is that as you shine light into a material, like glass,

393
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,940
it's not just that it induces wiggles in the charges of that material, but the specific

394
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,280
size of those wiggles depends on the frequency of the light, as a consequence of this denominator

395
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,660
term.

396
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,320
And the more those wiggle, the bigger the size of this second order wave caused by that

397
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,000
layer, which in turn causes a bigger shift to the phase of the overall wave.

398
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,840
Because a lot of different shifts to the phase are what causes this apparent slowdown to

399
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,000
the light, it means that the amount that it will slow down ultimately depends on the frequency

400
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,760
of the light.

401
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,800
So that is the real reason why prisms work.

402
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,780
You cannot truly explain the light separation until you get down to the driven harmonic

403
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,440
oscillator.

404
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,600
Now, I have left out a number of details, and again, I encourage the curious viewers

405
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,540
to take a look at the Feynman lectures that a lot of this is based on.

406
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,860
One quite important detail that would be a little criminal not to mention is that when

407
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,880
we're modeling our charge as a little harmonic oscillator with this linear restoring force,

408
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,020
there should really also be a term that depends on the velocity of that charge.

409
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,480
You might think of this as a kind of drag force.

410
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,180
This term accounts for the fact that energy from the incoming light wave is absorbed by

411
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,820
the material.

412
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Without it, this whole explanation would seem to imply that light always passes through

413
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,980
every material, not just glass and water, when as you can tell just by looking around,

414
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,140
there's all sorts of materials for which light is mostly reflected and absorbed.

415
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,960
As I mentioned at the start, folks on Patreon had numerous questions about the index of

416
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,900
refraction, like how it can be less than one, and why slowing implies bending, so I made

417
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,740
a supplemental video answering a handful of those questions, which should be published

418
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,700
in just a few days.

419
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,900
In the meantime, my friend Mithina from the channel Looking Glass Universe just put out

420
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,280
a pair of videos on the related but definitely distinct question of whether light slows down

421
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,520
in a medium, not in the sense of following the crests of a clean pure sine wave in a

422
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,560
steady state, but in the sense of trying to send information through that medium, like

423
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,660
with a little wave packet.

424
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,060
I definitely owe the existence of this video to many conversations with her about this

425
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,060
topic, and viewers here will definitely enjoy taking a look, especially at the second one.

426
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,380
By the way, some collaborators and I made this notebook that I think a lot of viewers

427
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,140
might enjoy, and given that it's the holiday season it seems worth a quick mention.

428
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,600
The premise is that every one of the pages has a quote that's related to math, and

429
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,640
I had a lot of fun curating them all, trying to constrain myself to quotes conveying some

430
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,500
genuinely thought-provoking idea.

431
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,360
And aside from the content, I basically made the kind of notebook that I most enjoy taking

432
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,360
notes in, something that's readily portable with very faint grid lines helpful for diagrams

433
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,240
but otherwise unobtrusive, all bound in this nice soft faux leather.

434
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,400
If that seems up your alley, you can find them in the 3blue1brown store next to a lot

435
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
of other mathematical merchandise.

436
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,300
Thanks for watching!
