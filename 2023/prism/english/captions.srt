1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
I realized recently that I didn't really understand how a prism works, and I suspect

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,480
most people out there don't either.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,800
Arguably this is one of the most widely recognized physics experiments ever.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,680
After all, how many others have earned a place as an iconic album cover?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,300
Sure, some of Pink Floyd's design choices run completely contrary to the actual physics.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,720
Like why did they make the light inside the prism white?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,180
And bafflingly, why would you draw all the colors as a discrete set, like a child making

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,220
a rainbow, despite the fact that one of the key points in Newton's original experiment

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,880
involving prisms was that sunlight contains a continuous spectrum of colors?

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,760
Still, setting that aside, it's cool that it's in pop culture at all, and any self-respecting

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
physics enthusiast should know how it works, but the thing I realized is that my understanding

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,320
hit a wall pretty quickly if pressed.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,180
You see, the standard explanation, what you might hear in a high school physics class

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,380
for example, goes something like this.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,180
When light enters a medium, like glass, it slows down, in the sense that if you look

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,780
at the crests of the wave, in a vacuum those crests are traveling at c, the speed of light,

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,780
but inside the glass those crests will be traveling a little bit slower.

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,540
And the specific ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed inside a medium

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,220
like this is called the index of refraction for that medium.

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,980
The reason we use the word refraction instead of the index of slowing is that if a beam

21
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,180
of light enters this glass at an angle, then a consequence of this slowdown is that it

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,860
bends a little bit, or using the lingo, it refracts.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,900
The way my high school physics teacher always explained this was to imagine a tank going

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,480
from some region where it can travel relatively quickly, like concrete, into something slower,

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,020
like mud, where if it's coming in at an angle, then as one of its treads hits the slow region

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,180
first, that tread will be going slower while the other one is faster, causing the whole

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,300
tank to steer a little bit until that second tread also enters the mud, then it continues

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,380
straight just traveling a little slower.

29
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,460
We'll get back to the actual reason for bending in a bit, but at this point the high

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,140
school physics students typically learn a law known as Snell's law which specifies

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,460
exactly how much things bend.

32
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,620
If you draw a line perpendicular to the boundary between the glass and water, and consider

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,280
the angle between that perpendicular line and the beam of light, Snell's law tells

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,900
us that the sine of this angle divided by the speed of the light is always a constant,

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,480
so the slower the light the lower that angle will be, and that lets you calculate how much

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,300
things refract.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,200
What's going on with a prism, then, is that the specific amount that light slows down

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,960
depends a little bit on its frequency.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,560
For example, blue light, which has a relatively high frequency, would get slowed down more

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,380
aggressively than red light, which has a relatively low frequency.

41
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,640
Most of the light you see is not a clean pure sine wave, in particular the white light coming

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,640
from the sun is not a clean sine wave, it's something much messier, but it can be expressed

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,360
as a sum of a bunch of clean sine waves, each one corresponding to a pure spectral color.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,020
So when you shine white light into a prism like this, all those different components

45
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,880
get refracted by slightly different amounts, causing this iconic separation of the pure

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,640
rainbow colors.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,440
So that is the standard explanation, and it's not wrong per se, it's just that all of

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,040
the key components are handed down from on high.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,180
Why would light slow down like this?

50
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,760
And what exactly do we mean by slowing down?

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,720
And even if you understand that, why would the amount that it slows down have anything

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,240
to do with the color of the light?

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,880
Is that just a coincidence or is it necessary?

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,740
If you have a sufficiently high standard for explanations, you want both of these facts

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,980
to feel discovered, rather than feeling like they were handed down.

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,880
The first explanation I saw that started to give this feeling came from the Feynman lectures

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,800
on the matter, and a lot of what I'd like to do with this video is simply animate a

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,220
lot of the key points that he makes there.

59
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,020
It involves really digging in to think about each individual wiggling charge in the material

60
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,180
and the propagating light waves caused by each one of those charges and how all of them

61
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,820
superimpose on top of each other, which feels like it should be a complete mess, but it

62
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,940
actually works out to be not only understandable, but satisfyingly explanatory.

63
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,260
For example, it explains why it has to depend on color, and the key intuition there really

64
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,540
comes down to what happens if you're bad at pushing a child on a swing.

65
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,100
Bear with me, I promise that'll make sense later.

66
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Also, when I mentioned on Patreon the intention to cover this topic, a lot of people had a

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,380
lot of questions about the index of refraction.

68
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,220
For example, numerous people asked about how it's possible for this number to be lower

69
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,660
than 1, which really does happen, despite that seeming to imply the impossibility of

70
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,420
something traveling faster than the speed of light.

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,540
There was also a question about birefringence, which is where a material can have two different

72
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,380
indices of refraction causing you to see double when you look through it.

73
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,780
And that actually ties in really nicely to putting in the final puzzle piece from the

74
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,580
last two videos about the barber pole phenomenon.

75
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,340
And a couple people also asked about why light slowing down would imply a bending like this.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,760
And I agree, that deserves a better explanation than the tank analogy.

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,780
I promise we'll get to all of these questions later, but it makes sense to first lay down

78
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,940
some groundwork by spending the bulk of our time on the key question of why passing through

79
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,600
a medium would change the speed of a light wave at all.

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,940
And for this, I want you to think of your material, like glass, as being broken up into

81
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,180
a bunch of distinct layers, all perpendicular to the direction the light is traveling.

82
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,980
And we'll start by focusing our attention on the effect of just one of those layers

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,420
on the light wave.

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,260
The true effect would be miniscule, but if you'll let me exaggerate it for a moment,

85
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,540
what it does is kick back the phase of the wave.

86
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,620
And maybe it's worth a brief aside to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes

87
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,120
to wave terminology.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,400
If you go and graph the function sine of x, when you put some term in front of it, affecting

89
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
how high that wave oscillates up and down, that's what we call the amplitude, when you

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,020
put a term in front of x, this will affect how rapidly it oscillates.

91
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,980
If this is meant to describe a wave over time, that term would be called the angular frequency,

92
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,060
whereas if it's meant to describe a wave over space, that constant would be called the wave number.

93
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Then if you were to add some other constant inside that sine function, and notice how

94
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,820
as you change what that constant is, it sort of slides the wave left and right, that term

95
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,640
describes the phase of the wave.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,700
So when I say that our light wave hitting a layer of glass causes its phase to get kicked

97
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,980
back, I mean if you take whatever function describes it before it hits the glass, then

98
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,180
the function describing it after that looks almost the same, just with a little extra

99
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,380
something added to the input of that sine function.

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,240
Like I said, in reality that'll be a very small number, something proportional to the

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,300
infinitesimal thickness of that layer, but I'll keep drawing it as something exaggerated

102
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,900
and keep track of the value of that phase kick over here on the left.

103
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,700
Let's say you go and add a bunch of other layers of the glass, each one also applying

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,400
their own kickback to the phase of the wave.

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,540
The question for you is what does that new wave look like?

106
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,580
If the value of that phase kick applied by each layer is something close to zero, then

107
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,760
the wave is hardly affected at all.

108
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,540
But the larger that phase kick, the more the wave gets squished together among all those

109
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,540
layers.

110
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,380
Admittedly, right here it looks all kaleidoscopic and weird, but that's really just because

111
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,060
I have a discrete set of layers, each applying an unrealistically large kick.

112
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,540
Notice what happens if I smooth it out by doubling the density of layers, but having

113
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,340
each one only apply half the phase kick.

114
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,520
And then I do that again, I double the density of the layers, but have each one only apply

115
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,760
half the phase kick.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,420
As I continue this over and over, approaching a situation where you have a continuum of

117
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,880
glass, each layer applying just a tiny infinitesimal phase kick, what you end up with is identical

118
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,360
to, indistinguishable from, a wave that's simply traveling slower, oscillating up and

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,120
down with the same frequency, but with a wavelength that's been kind of scrunched up.

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,840
This right here is the first key idea with the index of refraction.

121
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,560
Instead of asking, why does light slow down in glass, what we really need to ask is, why

122
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,880
does its interaction with a single layer of that glass cause a kickback to the phase of

123
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
the wave?

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,140
And then when we want to get quantitative and understand exactly how much the light

125
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,600
slows down, which is critical for understanding why it depends on color, instead the real

126
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,280
question is, how strong is that phase kick?

127
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,340
From here, it's helpful to turn back to the fundamentals of what light even is.

128
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,520
This is something we talked a lot about in the last video, but a little review never

129
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,100
hurts so let me go over the essentials.

130
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,160
As many of you know, light is a wave in the electromagnetic field, but here we'll just

131
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,360
be drawing the electric field.

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,200
The electric field associates each point in 3D space with a little three dimensional vector

133
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,600
telling you what force would be applied to a hypothetical unit charge sitting at that

134
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,200
point in space.

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,980
The key thing going on with light is that if you have a charged particle and something

136
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,860
causes it to wiggle up and down, that results in these propagating ripples in the electric

137
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,960
field away from the charge, and that propagation is traveling at the speed c, the speed of

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
light.

139
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,540
Whenever those ripples happen to reach another charged particle, they cause it to wiggle

140
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,320
up and down, albeit a little more weakly than the initial wiggle, and that in turn causes

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,540
its own propagations.

142
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,440
The way we described this in the last video was that if at some point in time a charge

143
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,980
is accelerating, then after a little delay, which depends on this speed c, the existence

144
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,680
of that acceleration induces a force on another charge.

145
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,420
We went over the specific force law describing this, it's something that can be derived

146
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,260
downstream of Maxwell's equations, but for our purposes here, the main thing to tuck

147
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,840
away in your mind is that the amount of time it takes that initial acceleration to cause

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,400
any kind of influence elsewhere travels at exactly the speed c.

149
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,640
And really, you should think of c not so much as the speed of light per se, but as the speed

150
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,200
of causality.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,580
It determines how fast any kind of influence travels, it's just that one of multiple

152
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,680
consequences of that is that it's the speed of light.

153
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,840
In particular, when you get a charge oscillating up and down in a nice clean sinusoidal motion,

154
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,880
you can think of these rippling effects in the electric field as describing the force

155
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,440
that would be applied to another charge sitting there as a result of that past acceleration.

156
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,120
I will freely admit that I had a bit too much fun in that video just simulating how the

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,440
electric field responds to accelerating charges, and that I'm kind of doing the same thing

158
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,960
here, but there are two important facts for our pursuit of the index of refraction.

159
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,800
The first is that when you have multiple different charges oscillating up and down, the net effect

160
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,840
on the electric field is just the sum of what it would be for each individual charge, which

161
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,800
is kind of what you would expect.

162
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
The way that it shakes out is that if you have a row of charges oscillating in sync

163
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,240
with each other, or for our purposes today, a plane of charges, all wiggling up and down

164
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,760
in sync within that plane, then the effects of each individual charge tend to cancel each

165
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,320
other out in most directions, except perpendicular to that plane, they actually constructively

166
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
interfere.

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,040
This is how you can get a concentrated beam of light.

168
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,040
The important thing is that if you have a layer of charges wiggling up and down in sync

169
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,320
with each other, then even far away from that layer, it produces this nice sinusoidal wave

170
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,920
in the electric field that we're so fond of drawing to represent light.

171
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,440
When I draw a light wave like this, it's really only depicting the electric field on

172
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,480
a single one-dimensional line.

173
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,260
A more full picture of light in three dimensions would look something more like this.

174
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,920
That tends to be a little bit busier, so usually we just draw the sine wave.

175
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,000
So thinking back to the question of why interactions with a layer of material would cause a kickback

176
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,240
to the phase of the wave, let's start thinking it through.

177
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,460
When a light beam enters a material, like glass, then it causes all of the charges inside

178
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,500
that material, you know, electrons, or maybe the occasional ion, to wiggle up and down

179
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,580
in response to that light wave.

180
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,520
You might think that adding together all the propagations from all those charges is a complete

181
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,840
nightmare, but we can think about it one layer at a time.

182
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,640
As the light wave causes this layer to wiggle up and down, that wiggling produces its own

183
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,520
second-order light wave at the same frequency, and it propagates in both directions perpendicular

184
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,800
to that layer.

185
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,760
The overall electric field, then, looks like the initial incoming light wave added together

186
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,640
with the second-order wave.

187
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,960
By far the most distracting part of what's going on here is everything on the left, and

188
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,200
this actually corresponds to the light being reflected back.

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,020
And from experience, you all know that when you look at water or you look at glass, light

190
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,300
not only goes through it, but some of it gets reflected back.

191
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,880
And we could have a whole interesting discussion on quantifying exactly how much, but in the

192
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,120
spirit of staying focused, we will completely ignore that for today, and only focus on what's

193
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,440
happening to the right of that layer.

194
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,920
You can probably predict what I'm going to say.

195
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,420
It turns out that when you add that second-order oscillation, the overall effect is almost

196
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,280
identical to the incoming light, but just shifted back in phase by a little bit.

197
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,740
And then because many successive shifts to the phase like this are the same thing as

198
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,500
light slowing down, this will ultimately explain the index of refraction.

199
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,580
But of course, the sufficiently curious viewers will now be raising their hands and asking,

200
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,300
why is that the effect when you add them together?

201
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,080
And so here it might be worth a little sidebar on how to think about adding two waves together.

202
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,560
If you draw some sine wave with some particular amplitude, some specific frequency, and some

203
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,760
specific phase, and then you draw another sine wave, also with its own amplitude, frequency,

204
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,080
and phase, in general it's very hard to think about what the sum of those two waves

205
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:52,600
should look like as you tweak those initial parameters.

206
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,040
In the specific case where the frequencies are the same, which is true for our example,

207
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,440
the result will also look like a sine wave with that same frequency.

208
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,380
But even then, it's a little tricky to think about exactly how to describe that wave.

209
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,520
It has some amplitude and some phase, and if I ask you to concretely compute both of

210
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,520
those numbers, based on the amplitudes and phases of the initial waves, it's not immediately

211
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,280
clear how you would do that without throwing a bunch of trig identities at the problem.

212
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,600
But here's a really nice way to think about it.

213
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Imagine that first wave describes the y-component of some rotating vector.

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,280
The length of that vector corresponds with the amplitude of our wave, and then the initial

215
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,720
rotation of that vector corresponds with the phase of our wave.

216
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,440
And then similarly think of that second wave as describing the y-component of another rotating

217
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,320
vector, where again the amplitude corresponds with the length of that vector, and the phase

218
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,880
of the wave tells us the initial angle of that vector.

219
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,000
Now to think about the sum of the two waves, just think about adding those two vectors

220
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,440
tip to tail.

221
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,800
And because they both have the same frequency as both of them rotate, their sum kind of

222
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440
rotates in lockstep with them.

223
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,400
So if you want to think about the amplitude of our resulting wave, it comes down to the

224
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,360
length of this vector sum, and similarly the phase corresponds to the angle of that vector

225
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
sum.

226
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,400
In some cases this tells you things that you probably already knew, like if the two phases

227
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,840
happen to be the same, then you get constructive interference and you have a bigger wave that

228
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
results.

229
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,720
And if the phases were 180 degrees out of sync, then you get deconstructive interference

230
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,480
with a relatively small resulting wave.

231
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,720
What's a little bit less obvious, but what's crucial for our discussion here, is that if

232
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,760
the phase of that second wave happens to be exactly 90 degrees behind the phase of the

233
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,120
first, so kind of a quarter cycle out of sync, and if that second wave is also very

234
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,800
small compared to the first, then if you look at the little vector sum on the lower left,

235
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,200
you'll notice how this means that the resulting wave is almost identical to the initial wave,

236
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,440
but just shifted back in its phase by a tiny bit.

237
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,600
Moreover, the size of that phase shift depends on the specific amplitude of that second wave.

238
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,080
So looking back at our previous animation, where we have some wiggling charges in a layer

239
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,880
of glass causing these second order propagations that need to be added together with the incoming

240
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,320
light, the way it works out is that the phase of that second wave is exactly a quarter of

241
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,200
a cycle behind the phase of the first.

242
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,300
So when you add them together, you get this little phase shift.

243
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,400
And then, critically, the size of that phase shift is bigger when that second order wave

244
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,640
is larger, and then smaller when that second order wave is smaller.

245
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,040
Again, the very curious viewers will be raising their hands and saying, why does it work

246
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,180
out to be exactly a quarter of a cycle behind?

247
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,160
There is a very nice reason, but it's just a little too much detail for us today.

248
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,320
If you're curious, I highly encourage you to take a look at the Feynman lectures on

249
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,640
the matter.

250
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,260
For our purposes, step back for a second and think about what you need to explain the key

251
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,040
question of prisms, which is why the index of refraction would depend on color at all.

252
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,440
As you now know, that index depends on how much each layer of glass kicks back the phase

253
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,860
of the wave, and that phase kick depends on the strength of the second order wave resulting

254
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,140
from charge oscillations in a layer of that glass.

255
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,660
So you need to drill in and understand exactly how much those charges wiggle in response

256
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,640
to an incoming light wave.

257
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,040
So let's zoom in on that layer and think of each one of those charged particles, and

258
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,880
even though the specific molecular structure is going to be something very complicated,

259
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,800
we're going to model each one of those charges as if it was bound to some equilibrium position

260
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,640
by a spring, or maybe a set of springs.

261
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,840
I don't mean this literally, of course, I just mean if we describe the displacement

262
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,680
of this charge from its equilibrium with a little vector x that's going to depend on

263
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,840
time, then in our model, the force applied to the charge, pulling it back to that equilibrium,

264
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,860
is going to be something proportional to the size of that displacement, with a little proportionality

265
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,420
constant k.

266
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,920
This is the same law that governs how springs work.

267
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,160
You might ask if that's accurate, and the idea is that for very small displacements,

268
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,280
it's actually a really good approximation.

269
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,040
This is a very common thing to do throughout physics, we would call it a linear restoring

270
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
force.

271
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,000
The idea is that maybe the actual force law depends on the position in a much more complicated

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,840
way, but we're basically taking a low order approximation near the equilibrium.

273
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,320
If I just run this as a simulation, plugging in this force law, here's what that displacement

274
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,600
looks like as a function of time.

275
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
What you get looks like a sine wave, this is called simple harmonic motion, and the

276
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,560
frequency of this wave is going to matter a lot for you and me, and finding that comes

277
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,080
down to solving a certain differential equation, because the force is really the same thing

278
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,800
as mass times acceleration, and the acceleration is the same thing as the second derivative

279
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,340
of that displacement.

280
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,560
So what we're saying is we want some function whose second derivative looks like a certain

281
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,440
constant times that function itself.

282
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,840
Any differential equations students among you might enjoy thinking about how you solve

283
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
this.

284
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,440
I won't go over the full details, but the answer is reasonably intuitive, and anyone

285
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,400
who knows a little calculus can just check it for themselves.

286
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
The way it shakes out is that if the initial condition is that our little charge has a

287
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,400
velocity of zero, but it's offset from the equilibrium by a little vector x naught, then

288
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,380
the way it evolves over time looks like x naught multiplied by a cosine expression.

289
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,400
So the amplitude of this wave is kind of uninteresting, it just depends on how far we pull the wave

290
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,440
back originally, but the meat is this frequency term, square root of k divided by m.

291
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,160
And if you think about it, this should hopefully be at least a little intuitive.

292
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,340
For example, if you increase k, which is kind of like increasing the strength of that spring,

293
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,120
then it results in a faster oscillation.

294
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,600
Whereas if you increase m, the mass of the particle, there's a lot more inertia, and

295
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,240
it results in a slower oscillation.

296
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,140
This term, square root of k divided by m, has a special name, it's called the resonant

297
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,200
frequency for our simple harmonic oscillator.

298
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,260
And being a little more precise, I should call this the resonant angular frequency.

299
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,500
This is always a little bit of an awkwardness with physics, where whenever you have some

300
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,940
kind of cyclic process, when you give an intuitive description, it's natural to phrase things

301
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,780
in terms of the frequency, the number of cycles that this process makes per unit time.

302
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,540
But when doing math, it's often more natural to talk about the angular frequency, which

303
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,820
you could think of as describing how much angle this process covers in radians per unit

304
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
time.

305
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,340
So the term is the same as the frequency but multiplied by 2 pi.

306
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,940
So for example, if you have something like a cosine expression, which you might think

307
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,480
of as describing the x component of a cycling vector like this, then the term sitting right

308
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,540
in front of the t in that cosine is the angular frequency.

309
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,180
This is why angular frequency makes the math a little cleaner.

310
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,780
For example, in our simple harmonic motion, the term sitting in front of t looks like

311
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,340
the square root of k divided by m, which I'm writing as omega sub r.

312
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,460
Let's package all of that up and call that our solution in the simple case, where there's

313
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,020
no external force acting on our charged particle.

314
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,140
But of course, what we're interested in is what happens when you shine a beam of light

315
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,020
on this material, which intuitively causes this charge to jiggle, but the question is

316
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,580
how much.

317
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,500
In our equation, this looks like adding a new force term corresponding to the light

318
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
wave.

319
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,340
That force oscillates up and down also according to some kind of cosine function, but this

320
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,220
time with a distinct angular frequency that I'm going to call omega sub l.

321
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,140
E naught here describes the strength of the wave, and then q describes the charge of whatever

322
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,020
particle we're modeling.

323
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,380
As usual, it's a lot easier to think about when we only draw a subset of that light wave,

324
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,300
and in this case we're going to draw it on the plane of the layer of material we care

325
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
about.

326
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,660
You might think of gusts of wind blowing our little ball on the spring up and down in a

327
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,860
clean sinusoidal pattern.

328
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,540
Or as another analogy, it's similar to pushing a child on a swing.

329
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,300
The swing would oscillate on its own due to the force of gravity, but you as the pusher

330
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,140
are applying an external force which itself is oscillating over time.

331
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,900
Although a key difference here is that the frequency of that external force in general

332
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,960
has nothing to do with the resonant frequency of that little oscillator.

333
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,220
The better analogy would be if you're pushing the child on the swing with a cyclic force

334
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,340
that has nothing to do with what the swing naturally wants to do.

335
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,420
And my favorite part in literally trying to do this with my niece is that at some point

336
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,380
she gently murmurs to herself, this isn't how mom does it.

337
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,500
Now, in trying to understand how much our charge is oscillating in response to the incoming

338
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,140
light, let me start by just simulating it and plotting the result.

339
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,940
You'll notice that there's a little start-up period where it kind of has to get going,

340
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,260
but then after that, mercifully, it looks nice and clean, just like another sine wave.

341
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,740
Now you might be thinking, yeah yeah, everything is sine waves, but it's important to understand

342
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,740
that this one has a very different character from the sine wave we saw earlier.

343
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,460
Earlier, without any external forces, the frequency of that wave came down to the spring

344
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,840
constant and the mass, which is to say it depends exclusively on material properties

345
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,180
of the glass.

346
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,420
By contrast, with this external cycling driving force, the frequency in that steady state

347
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,420
is the same as the frequency of the light.

348
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,280
And then in our first case, the amplitude of the wave was kind of uninteresting, it

349
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,700
just depends on how far you pulled the spring out to begin with.

350
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,780
But in the second case, the amplitude of this wave is actually where all the interesting

351
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,520
stuff happens.

352
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,940
Exactly how much will this charge be oscillating in response to the light wave?

353
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,020
Again, I won't go over the full details of solving this, but any eager calculus students

354
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,020
among you might enjoy going through the exercise where if you just guess that a solution looks

355
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,860
like a cosine wave with the same frequency as the light, and you solve for the amplitude,

356
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,660
you can get a concrete solution to this equation that looks like this.

357
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,140
This is worth unpacking for a bit, and just to be clear, this is only describing things

358
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,780
in the steady state, after things have gotten up and going.

359
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,540
A fully descriptive solution would be notably more complicated.

360
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,980
As I said, everything interesting here comes down to the amplitude, which here looks like

361
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,940
a large collection of constants, most of which should be pretty intuitive if you take

362
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,300
a moment to think about it.

363
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,560
For example, it is proportional to the strength of that incoming light wave, so the stronger

364
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,600
the light the more the oscillations.

365
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,140
It's also proportional to the charge, which again makes sense.

366
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,960
And the real heart of the matter comes down to what's sitting in the denominator here,

367
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,740
the difference between the square of the resonant frequency and the square of the light frequency.

368
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,020
And to build a little intuition, take a moment to think about what would happen if the frequency

369
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,260
of the incoming light was something very close to the resonant frequency of this oscillator.

370
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,640
This is analogous to the normal situation pushing a child on a swing, where the frequency

371
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,060
of your force lines up quite closely with what the swing wants to do.

372
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,500
In this case, running the simulation, notice how the oscillations of that particle will

373
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,840
grow and grow and grow, becoming quite large over time.

374
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,620
Some of you may know the famous example of the Millennium Bridge in London, where on

375
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,480
its opening day it started oscillating way more than the engineers expected it to.

376
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,700
And what was going on is that the frequency of the steps of the crowd lined up very closely

377
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,300
with a resonant frequency, causing this worryingly high amplitude.

378
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:29,360
By contrast, notice what happens in the simulation if the frequency of the light, ωL, is something

379
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,680
much smaller than the resonant frequency.

380
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,860
For this particular simulation it takes a little bit of a moment before things get into

381
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,820
their full swing, eventually it finds a nice sinusoidal motion, but the amplitude of that

382
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,860
motion is much more modest in comparison.

383
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,820
So what our equation is telling us is that the larger the difference between those frequencies,

384
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,720
then the bigger the denominator, so the smaller the overall wiggle to that charge.

385
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,100
And again, this is something you can see in the footage with my niece.

386
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,060
As I'm applying a force with a frequency that's very different from what the swing wants to

387
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:08,220
do, she ends up oscillating at the same frequency as my force, but she's going at a relatively

388
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,900
low amplitude.

389
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,700
Stepping back, what this means is that as you shine light into a material, like glass,

390
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,000
it's not just that it induces wiggles in the charges of that material, but the specific

391
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,220
size of those wiggles depends on the frequency of the light, as a consequence of this denominator

392
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,220
term.

393
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,220
And the more those wiggle, the bigger the size of this second order wave caused by that

394
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,640
layer, which in turn causes a bigger shift to the phase of the overall wave.

395
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,780
Because a lot of different shifts to the phase are what causes this apparent slowdown to

396
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,980
the light, it means that the amount that it will slow down ultimately depends on the frequency

397
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,500
of the light.

398
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,180
So that is the real reason why prisms work.

399
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,700
You cannot truly explain the light separation until you get down to the driven harmonic

400
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,340
oscillator.

401
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,580
Now, I have left out a number of details, and again, I encourage the curious viewers

402
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,140
to take a look at the Feynman lectures that a lot of this is based on.

403
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,900
One quite important detail that would be a little criminal not to mention is that when

404
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,340
we're modeling our charge as a little harmonic oscillator with this linear restoring force,

405
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,460
there should really also be a term that depends on the velocity of that charge.

406
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,100
You might think of this as a kind of drag force.

407
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,060
This term accounts for the fact that energy from the incoming light wave is absorbed by

408
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,740
the material.

409
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,620
Without it, this whole explanation would seem to imply that light always passes through

410
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,340
every material, not just glass and water, when as you can tell just by looking around,

411
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,980
there's all sorts of materials for which light is mostly reflected and absorbed.

412
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,860
As I mentioned at the start, folks on Patreon had numerous questions about the index of

413
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,860
refraction, like how it can be less than one, and why slowing implies bending, so I made

414
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,740
a supplemental video answering a handful of those questions, which should be published

415
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,580
in just a few days.

416
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,820
In the meantime, my friend Mithena from the channel Looking Glass Universe just put out

417
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,220
a pair of videos on the related but definitely distinct question of whether light slows down

418
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,340
in a medium, not in the sense of following the crests of a clean pure sine wave in a

419
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,460
steady state, but in the sense of trying to send information through that medium, like

420
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,940
with a little wave packet.

421
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,020
I definitely owe the existence of this video to many conversations with her about this

422
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,380
topic, and viewers here will definitely enjoy taking a look, especially at the second one.

423
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,380
By the way, some collaborators and I made this notebook that I think a lot of viewers

424
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,500
might enjoy, and given that it's the holiday season it seems worth a quick mention.

425
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,620
The premise is that every one of the pages has a quote that's related to math, and

426
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,700
I had a lot of fun curating them all, trying to constrain myself to quotes conveying some

427
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,140
genuinely thought-provoking idea.

428
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,900
And then aside from the content, I basically made the kind of notebook that I most enjoy

429
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,620
taking notes in, something that's readily portable with very faint gridlines helpful

430
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,820
for diagrams, but otherwise unobtrusive, all bound in this nice soft faux leather.

431
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,340
If that seems up your alley, you can find them in the 3blue1brown store next to a lot

432
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,020
of other mathematical merchandise.
