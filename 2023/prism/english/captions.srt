1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,703
I realized recently that I didn't really understand how a prism works, 

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,260
and I suspect most people out there don't either.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,180
Arguably this is one of the most widely recognized physics experiments ever.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,220
After all, how many others have earned a place as an iconic album cover?

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,880
Sure, some of Pink Floyd's design choices run completely contrary to the actual physics.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,100
Like why did they make the light inside the prism white?

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,991
And bafflingly, why would you draw all the colors as a discrete set, 

8
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:35,369
like a child making a rainbow, despite the fact that one of the key points in Newton's 

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,696
original experiment involving prisms was that sunlight contains a continuous spectrum 

10
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:40,200
of colors?

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,727
Still, setting that aside, it's cool that it's in pop culture at all, 

12
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:48,342
and any self-respecting physics enthusiast should know how it works, 

13
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:52,900
but the thing I realized is that my understanding hit a wall pretty quickly if pressed.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,151
You see, the standard explanation, what you might hear in a 

15
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:59,620
high school physics class for example, goes something like this.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,315
When light enters a medium, like glass, it slows down, 

17
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:06,439
in the sense that if you look at the crests of the wave, 

18
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,058
in a vacuum those crests are travelling at c, the speed of light, 

19
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:14,060
but inside the glass those crests will be travelling a little bit slower.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,090
And the specific ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed 

21
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,460
inside a medium like this is called the index of refraction for that medium.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,813
The reason we use the word refraction instead of, say, the index of slowing, 

23
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:32,273
is that if a beam of light enters this glass at an angle, 

24
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:37,464
then a consequence of this slowdown is that it bends a little bit, or using the lingo, 

25
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,180
it refracts.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,766
And the way my high school physics teacher always explained this was to imagine a 

27
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:46,942
tank going from some region where it can travel relatively quickly, like concrete, 

28
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:50,464
into something slower, like mud, where if it's coming in at an angle, 

29
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:53,181
then as one of its treads hits the slow region first, 

30
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,351
that tread will be going slower while the other one is faster, 

31
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,716
causing the whole thing to steer a little bit, 

32
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:02,389
until that second tread also enters the mud, then it continues straight, 

33
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,000
just travelling a little slower.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,768
We'll get back to the actual reason for bending in a bit, 

35
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:11,104
but at this point the high school physics students typically learn 

36
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:14,740
a law known as Snell's law, which specifies exactly how much things bend.

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,351
If you draw a line perpendicular to the boundary between the glass and water, 

38
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:23,442
and consider the angle between that perpendicular line and the beam of light, 

39
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:28,058
then Snell's law tells us that the sine of this angle divided by the speed of the light 

40
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:29,160
is always a constant.

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,490
So the slower the light, the lower that angle will be, 

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,320
and that lets you actually calculate how much things refract.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,801
What's going on with a prism, then, is that the specific amount 

44
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:43,140
that light slows down depends a little bit on its frequency.

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,179
For example, blue light, which has a relatively high frequency, 

46
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:50,154
would get slowed down more aggressively than red light, 

47
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,120
which has a relatively low frequency.

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,400
Now most of the light that you see is not a clean pure sine wave, 

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,339
in particular the white light coming from the sun is not a clean sine wave, 

50
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:04,123
it's something much messier, but it can be expressed as a sum of a bunch 

51
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:07,700
of clean sine waves, each one corresponding to a pure spectral color.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,048
So when you shine white light into a prism like this, 

53
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:14,945
all those different components get refracted by slightly different amounts, 

54
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,920
causing this iconic separation of the pure rainbow colors.

55
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,173
So that is the standard explanation, and it's not wrong per se, 

56
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:26,060
it's just that all of the key components are handed down from on high.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Why would light slow down like this?

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,240
And what exactly do we mean by slowing down?

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,295
And even if you understand that, why would the amount that 

60
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,980
it slows down have anything to do with the color of the light?

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
Is that just a coincidence, or is it necessary?

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,588
If you have a sufficiently high standard for explanations, 

63
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:45,003
you want both of these facts to feel discovered, 

64
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:47,320
rather than feeling like they were handed down.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,149
The first explanation I saw that started to give this feeling came from 

66
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:54,426
the Feynman lectures on the matter, and a lot of what I'd like to do with 

67
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:57,660
this video is simply animate a lot of the key points that he makes there.

68
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,677
It involves really digging in to think about each individual wiggling 

69
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:05,306
charge in the material, and the propagating light waves caused by each 

70
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:09,140
one of those charges, and how all of them superimpose on top of each other.

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,758
Which feels like it should be a complete mess, 

72
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:16,220
but it actually works out to be not only understandable, but satisfyingly explanatory.

73
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,687
For example, it explains why it has to depend on color, 

74
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:23,676
and the key intuition there really comes down to what happens if you're bad at 

75
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,040
pushing a child on a swing.

76
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,520
Bear with me, I promise that'll make sense later.

77
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,730
Also, when I mentioned on Patreon the intention to cover this topic, 

78
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,920
a lot of people had a lot of questions about the index of refraction.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,935
For example, numerous people asked about how it's possible for this number 

80
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:43,004
to be lower than 1, which really does happen, despite that seeming to imply 

81
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:46,860
the impossibility of something traveling faster than the speed of light.

82
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,550
There was also a question about birefringence, 

83
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,846
which is where a material can have two different indices of refraction, 

84
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:55,180
causing you to see double when you look through it.

85
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,285
And that actually ties in really nicely to putting in the final 

86
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:01,620
puzzle piece from the last two videos about the barber pole phenomenon.

87
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,796
And a couple people also asked about why light slowing down would imply a bending 

88
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:11,340
like this, and I agree that deserves a better explanation than the tank analogy.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,559
I promise we'll get to all of these questions later, 

90
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:18,510
but it makes sense to first lay down some groundwork by spending the bulk of 

91
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,512
our time on the key question of why passing through a medium would change the 

92
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:24,000
speed of a light wave at all.

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,914
And for this, I want you to think of your material, like glass, 

94
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:30,640
as being broken up into a bunch of distinct layers, 

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,680
all perpendicular to the direction the light is traveling.

96
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,349
And we'll start by focusing our attention on the 

97
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,760
effect of just one of those layers on the light wave.

98
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,947
The true effect would be miniscule, but if you'll let me exaggerate it for a moment, 

99
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,560
what it does is kick back the phase of the wave.

100
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,490
And maybe it's worth a brief aside to make sure we're 

101
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,600
all on the same page when it comes to wave terminology.

102
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,166
If you go and graph the function sine of x, when you put some term in front of it, 

103
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:00,626
affecting how high that wave oscillates up and down, that's what we call the amplitude, 

104
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,580
when you put a term in front of x, this will affect how rapidly it oscillates.

105
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,269
If this is meant to describe a wave over time, 

106
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,676
that term would be called the angular frequency, 

107
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,280
whereas if it's meant to describe a wave over space, 

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,540
that constant would be called the wave number.

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,626
Then if you were to add some other constant inside that sine function, 

110
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,311
and notice how as you change what that constant is, 

111
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:25,700
it sort of slides the wave left and right, that term describes the phase of the wave.

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,454
So when I say that our light wave hitting a layer of glass causes its phase to 

113
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:34,151
get kicked back, I mean if you take whatever function describes it before it 

114
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:38,090
hits the glass, then the function describing it after that looks almost the same, 

115
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,740
just with a little extra something added to the input of that sine function.

116
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,985
Like I said, in reality that'll be a very small number, 

117
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:48,293
something proportional to the infinitesimal thickness of that layer, 

118
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:52,177
but I'll keep drawing it as something exaggerated and keep track of the value of 

119
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,000
that phase kick over here on the left.

120
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,744
Let's say you go and add a bunch of other layers of the glass, 

121
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,940
each one also applying their own kickback to the phase of the wave.

122
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,840
The question for you is what does that new wave look like?

123
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,425
If the value of that phase kick applied by each layer is something really close to zero, 

124
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,280
then the wave is hardly affected at all.

125
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,048
But the larger that phase kick, the more the wave 

126
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:15,780
kind of gets squished together among all those layers.

127
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,818
Admittedly, right here it looks all kaleidoscopic and weird, 

128
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:23,090
but that's really just because I have a discrete set of layers, 

129
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,340
each applying an unrealistically large kick.

130
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,839
Notice what happens if I smooth it out by doubling the density of layers, 

131
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,540
but having each one only apply half the phase kick.

132
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,242
And then I do that again, I double the density of the layers, 

133
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:38,600
but have each one only apply half the phase kick.

134
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,702
As I continue this over and over, approaching a situation where you have a continuum of 

135
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:48,500
glass, each layer applying just a tiny infinitesimal phase kick, 

136
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,123
what you end up with is identical to, indistinguishable from, 

137
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:57,266
a wave that's simply traveling slower, oscillating up and down with the same frequency, 

138
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,480
but with a wavelength that's been kind of scrunched up.

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,080
This right here is the first key idea with the index of refraction.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,682
Instead of asking why does light slow down in glass, 

141
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:11,217
what we really need to ask is why does its interaction with 

142
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:15,400
a single layer of that glass cause a kickback to the phase of the wave?

143
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,153
And then when we want to get quantitative and understand exactly how much 

144
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:24,587
the light slows down, which is critical for understanding why it depends on color, 

145
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,740
instead the real question is how strong is that phase kick?

146
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,960
From here it's helpful to turn back to the fundamentals of what light even is.

147
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,576
This is something we talked a lot about in the last video, 

148
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:38,280
but a little review never hurts, so let me go over the essentials.

149
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,184
As many of you know, light is a wave in the electromagnetic field, 

150
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,680
but here we'll just be drawing the electric field.

151
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,888
The electric field associates each point in 3D space with a 

152
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:52,456
little 3-dimensional vector telling you what force would be 

153
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:56,560
applied to a hypothetical unit charge sitting at that point in space.

154
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,615
The key thing going on with light is that if you have a charged 

155
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:04,674
particle and something causes it to wiggle up and down, 

156
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:09,371
that results in these propagating ripples in the electric field away from the charge, 

157
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:13,140
and that propagation is traveling at the speed c, the speed of light.

158
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,918
Whenever those ripples happen to reach another charged particle, 

159
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:21,319
they cause it to wiggle up and down, albeit a little more weakly than the initial wiggle, 

160
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,520
and that in turn causes its own propagations.

161
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,038
The way we described this in the last video was that if at some point in time 

162
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:33,947
a charge is accelerating, then after a little delay, which depends on this speed c, 

163
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:37,980
the existence of that acceleration induces a force on another charge.

164
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,332
We went over the specific force law describing this, 

165
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,808
it's something that can be derived downstream of Maxwell's equations, 

166
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:48,781
but for our purposes here, the main thing to tuck away in your mind is that the 

167
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:52,803
amount of time it takes that initial acceleration to cause any kind of influence 

168
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,840
elsewhere travels at exactly the speed c.

169
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,114
And really, you should think of c not so much as the speed of light per se, 

170
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,620
but as the speed of causality.

171
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,804
It determines how fast any kind of influence travels, 

172
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:08,260
it's just that one of multiple consequences of that is that it's the speed of light.

173
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,232
In particular, when you get a charge oscillating up and down in a 

174
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:16,084
nice clean sinusoidal motion, you can think of these rippling effects 

175
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:19,827
in the electric field as describing the force that would be applied 

176
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,680
to another charge sitting there as a result of that past acceleration.

177
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,390
I will freely admit that I had a bit too much fun in that video just simulating how the 

178
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,646
electric field responds to accelerating charges, 

179
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,855
and that I'm kind of doing the same thing here, 

180
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:36,400
but there are two important facts for our pursuit of the index of refraction.

181
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,142
The first is that when you have multiple different charges oscillating up and down, 

182
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,812
the net effect on the electric field is just the sum of what it would be 

183
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,180
for each individual charge, which is kind of what you would expect.

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,742
The way it shakes out is that if you have a row of charges oscillating 

185
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:55,776
in sync with each other, or for our purposes today, 

186
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:59,918
a plane of charges all wiggling up and down in sync within that plane, 

187
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:04,177
then the effects of each individual charge tend to cancel each other out 

188
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:07,444
in most directions, except perpendicular to that plane, 

189
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,720
they actually constructively interfere.

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,560
This is how you can get a concentrated beam of light.

191
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,860
That's the important thing.

192
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,153
If you have a layer of charges wiggling up and down in sync with each other, 

193
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:22,106
then even far away from that layer, it produces this nice sinusoidal wave 

194
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:25,900
in the electric field that we're so fond of drawing to represent light.

195
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,101
When I draw a light wave like this, it's really only 

196
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:32,980
depicting the electric field on a single one-dimensional line.

197
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,640
A more full picture of light in three dimensions would look something more like this.

198
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,340
That tends to be a little bit busier, so usually we just draw the sine wave.

199
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,122
So thinking back to the question of why interactions with a layer of material 

200
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:51,540
would cause a kick back to the phase of the wave, let's start thinking it through.

201
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,872
When a light beam enters a material, like glass, 

202
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:58,660
then it causes all of the charges inside that material, you know, 

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,849
electrons or maybe the occasional ion, to wiggle up and down in response 

204
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:03,940
to that light wave.

205
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,929
You might think that adding together all the propagations from all those 

206
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:11,620
charges is a complete nightmare, but we can think about it one layer at a time.

207
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,059
As the light wave causes this layer to wiggle up and down, 

208
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:20,554
that wiggling produces its own second-order light wave at the same frequency, 

209
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:24,300
and it propagates in both directions perpendicular to that layer.

210
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,841
The overall electric field, then, looks like the initial 

211
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:31,040
incoming light wave added together with the second-order wave.

212
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,564
By far the most distracting part of what's going on here is everything on the left, 

213
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,600
and this actually corresponds to the light being reflected back.

214
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,913
And from experience, you all know that when you look at water or you look at glass, 

215
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,860
light not only goes through it, but some of it gets reflected back.

216
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,904
And we could have a whole interesting discussion on quantifying exactly how much, 

217
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,505
but in the spirit of staying focused, we will completely ignore that for 

218
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,860
today and only focus on what's happening to the right of that layer.

219
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,200
You can probably predict what I'm going to say.

220
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,137
It turns out that when you add that second-order oscillation, 

221
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:07,415
the overall effect is almost identical to the incoming light, 

222
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:09,900
but just shifted back in phase by a little bit.

223
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,270
And then because many successive shifts to the phase like this are the same 

224
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,640
thing as light slowing down, this will ultimately explain the index of refraction.

225
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,301
But of course the sufficiently curious viewers will now be raising 

226
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,440
their hands and asking, why is that the effect when you add them together?

227
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,218
And so here it might be worth a little sidebar 

228
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:30,240
on how to think about adding two waves together.

229
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,140
If you draw some sine wave with some particular amplitude, some specific frequency, 

230
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,315
and some specific phase, and then you draw another sine wave, 

231
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:40,926
also with its own amplitude, frequency, and phase, 

232
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:45,022
in general it's very hard to think about what the sum of those two waves should 

233
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,480
look like as you tweak those initial parameters.

234
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,918
In the specific case where the frequencies are the same, which is true for our example, 

235
00:13:56,918 --> 00:14:00,580
the result will also look like a sine wave with that same frequency.

236
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,920
But even then it's a little tricky to think about exactly how to describe that wave.

237
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,837
It has some amplitude and some phase, and if I ask you to concretely compute both of 

238
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:13,678
those numbers based on the amplitudes and phases of the initial waves, 

239
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:18,113
it's not immediately clear how you would do that without throwing a bunch of trig 

240
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:19,520
identities at the problem.

241
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,140
But here's a really nice way to think about it.

242
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,860
Imagine that first wave describes the y-component of some rotating vector.

243
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,352
The length of that vector corresponds with the amplitude of our wave, 

244
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:37,000
and then the initial rotation of that vector corresponds with the phase of our wave.

245
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,013
Similarly, think of the second wave as describing the y-component of another 

246
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:46,561
rotating vector, where the amplitude corresponds with the length of that vector, 

247
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:50,380
and the phase of the wave tells us the initial angle of that vector.

248
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,274
Now to think about the sum of the two waves, just 

249
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,720
think about adding those two vectors tip to tail.

250
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,434
And because they both have the same frequency as both of them rotate, 

251
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,740
their sum rotates in lockstep with them.

252
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,717
So if you want to think about the amplitude of our resulting wave, 

253
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,093
it comes down to the length of this vector sum, 

254
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:16,460
and similarly the phase corresponds to the angle of that vector sum.

255
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,155
In some cases this tells you things that you probably already knew, 

256
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,876
like if the two phases happen to be the same, then you get 

257
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:25,920
constructive interference and you have a bigger wave that results.

258
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,027
And if the phases were 180 degrees out of sync, 

259
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:33,440
then you get deconstructive interference with a relatively small resulting wave.

260
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,553
What's a little bit less obvious, but what's crucial for our discussion here, 

261
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:42,908
is that if the phase of that second wave happens to be exactly 90 degrees behind 

262
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,349
the phase of the first, so kind of a quarter cycle out of sync, 

263
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,897
and if that second wave is also very small compared to the first, 

264
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:53,176
then if you look at the little vector sum on the lower left, 

265
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:57,477
you'll notice how this means that the resulting wave is almost identical to the 

266
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:01,080
initial wave, but has just shifted back in its phase by a tiny bit.

267
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,471
Moreover, the size of that phase shift depends 

268
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:07,360
on the specific amplitude of that second wave.

269
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,830
So looking back at our previous animation, where we have some wiggling charges 

270
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,918
in a layer of glass causing these second order propagations that need to be 

271
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:21,168
added together with the incoming light, the way it works out is that the phase 

272
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:25,580
of that second wave is exactly a quarter of a cycle behind the phase of the first.

273
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,760
So when you add them together, you get this little phase shift.

274
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,780
And then, critically, the size of that phase shift is bigger when that second 

275
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,240
order wave is larger, and then smaller when that second order wave is smaller.

276
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,548
Again, the very curious viewers will be raising their hands and saying, 

277
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,460
why does it work out to be exactly a quarter of a cycle behind?

278
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,700
There is a very nice reason, but it's just a little too much detail for us today.

279
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,891
If you're curious, I highly encourage you to take 

280
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,720
a look at the Feynman lectures on the matter.

281
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,277
For our purposes, step back for a second and think about what you need to explain the 

282
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:04,319
key question of prisms, which is why the index of refraction would depend on color at all.

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,302
As you now know, that index depends on how much each layer of glass kicks back 

284
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:13,332
the phase of the wave, and that phase kick depends on the strength of the 

285
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,579
second order wave resulting from charge oscillations in a layer of that glass.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,389
So you need to drill in and understand exactly how much 

287
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:24,960
those charges wiggle in response to an incoming light wave.

288
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,757
So let's zoom in on that layer and think of each one of those charged particles, 

289
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,465
and even though the specific molecular structure is going to be something 

290
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:37,172
very complicated, we're going to model each one of those charges as if it 

291
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:41,080
was bound to some equilibrium position by a spring, or maybe a set of springs.

292
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I don't mean this literally, of course, I just mean if we describe the 

293
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,656
displacement of this charge from its equilibrium with a little vector x 

294
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:54,389
that's going to depend on time, then in our model, the force applied to the charge, 

295
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:58,614
pulling it back to that equilibrium, is going to be something proportional 

296
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:02,840
to the size of that displacement, with a little proportionality constant k.

297
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,440
This is the same law that governs how springs work.

298
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,862
You might ask if that's accurate, and the idea is that for very small displacements, 

299
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:11,820
it's actually a really good approximation.

300
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,250
This is a very common thing to do throughout physics, 

301
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,140
we would call it a linear restoring force.

302
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,461
The idea is that maybe the actual force law depends on the position in a much more 

303
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:24,193
complicated way, but we're basically taking a low order approximation near the 

304
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:24,760
equilibrium.

305
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,814
If I just run this as a simulation, plugging in this force law, 

306
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,880
here's what that displacement looks like as a function of time.

307
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,385
What you get looks like a sine wave, this is called simple harmonic motion, 

308
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:40,104
and the frequency of this wave is going to matter a lot for you and me, 

309
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:43,822
and finding that comes down to solving a certain differential equation, 

310
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,489
because the force is really the same thing as mass times acceleration, 

311
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:51,880
and the acceleration is the same thing as the second derivative of that displacement.

312
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,313
So what we're saying is we want some function whose second 

313
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:58,740
derivative looks like a certain constant times that function itself.

314
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,179
Any differential equations students among you 

315
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,000
might enjoy thinking about how you solve this.

316
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,544
I won't go over the full details, but the answer is reasonably intuitive, 

317
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:09,760
and anyone who knows a little calculus can just check it for themselves.

318
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,544
The way it shakes out is that if the initial condition is that our little charge has 

319
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:19,386
a velocity of zero, but it's offset from the equilibrium by a little vector x-naught, 

320
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:24,340
then the way it evolves over time looks like x-naught multiplied by a cosine expression.

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,206
So the amplitude of this wave is kind of uninteresting, 

322
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:31,262
it just depends on how far we pulled things back originally, 

323
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:34,620
but the meat is this frequency term, square root of k divided by m.

324
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,620
And if you think about it, this should hopefully be at least a little intuitive.

325
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,657
For example, if you increase k, which is kind of like increasing 

326
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:46,540
the strength of that spring, then it results in a faster oscillation.

327
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,843
Whereas if you increase m, the mass of the particle, 

328
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:53,360
there's a lot more inertia and it results in a slower oscillation.

329
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,282
This term, square root of k divided by m, has a special name, 

330
00:19:57,282 --> 00:20:00,740
it's called the resonant frequency for our simple harmonic oscillator.

331
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,640
And being a little more precise, I should call this the resonant angular frequency.

332
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,839
This is always a little bit of an awkwardness with physics, 

333
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,258
where whenever you have some kind of cyclic process, 

334
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:14,184
when you give an intuitive description, it's natural to phrase things in terms of the 

335
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,380
frequency, the number of cycles that this process makes per unit time.

336
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,414
But when doing math, it's often more natural to talk about the angular frequency, 

337
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:24,087
which you could think of as describing how much angle this 

338
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,900
process covers in radians per unit time.

339
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,920
It's just the same as the frequency, but multiplied by 2 pi.

340
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,492
So for example, if you have something like a cosine expression, 

341
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:36,756
which you might think of as describing the x component of a cycling vector like this, 

342
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:41,020
then the term sitting right in front of the t in that cosine is the angular frequency.

343
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,880
This is why angular frequency makes the math a little cleaner.

344
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,841
For example, in our simple harmonic motion, the term sitting in front of t 

345
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:51,720
looks like the square root of k divided by m, which I'm writing as omega sub r.

346
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,047
Let's package all of that up and call that our solution in the simple case, 

347
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,120
where there's no external force acting on our charged particle.

348
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,104
But of course, what we're interested in is what happens when 

349
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:06,484
you shine a beam of light on this material, which intuitively 

350
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:09,700
causes this charge to jiggle, but the question is how much.

351
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,920
In our equation, this looks like adding a new force term corresponding to the light wave.

352
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,862
That force oscillates up and down, also according to some kind of cosine function, 

353
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:24,480
but this time with a distinct angular frequency, that I'm going to call omega sub l.

354
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,630
E naught here describes the strength of the wave, 

355
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,180
and then q describes the charge of whatever particle we're modeling.

356
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,292
As usual, it's a lot easier to think about when we only draw a subset of that light wave, 

357
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:39,166
and in this case we're going to draw it on the plane of the 

358
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,700
layer of material we care about.

359
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,187
You might think of gusts of wind blowing our little ball 

360
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:47,220
on the spring up and down in a clean sinusoidal pattern.

361
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,120
Or as another analogy, it's similar to pushing a child on a swing.

362
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,063
The swing would oscillate on its own due to the force of gravity, 

363
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:59,902
but you as the pusher are applying an external force which itself is oscillating 

364
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:00,500
over time.

365
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,701
Although a key difference here is that the frequency of that external force in 

366
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:10,220
general has nothing to do with the resonant frequency of that little oscillator.

367
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,700
The better analogy would be if you're pushing the child on the swing with a 

368
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,560
cyclic force that has nothing to do with what the swing naturally wants to do.

369
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,143
And my favorite part in literally trying to do this with my niece is that 

370
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:27,000
at some point she gently murmurs to herself, this isn't how mom does it.

371
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,679
Now, in trying to understand how much our charge is oscillating in response to 

372
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,760
the incoming light, let me start by just simulating it and plotting the result.

373
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,540
You'll notice that there's a little startup period where it kind of has to get going, 

374
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,040
but then after that, mercifully, it looks nice and clean, just like another sine wave.

375
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,117
Now you might be thinking, yeah, yeah, everything is sine waves, 

376
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,236
but it's important to understand that this one has a very different character from the 

377
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:54,420
sine wave we saw earlier.

378
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,665
Earlier, without any external forces, the frequency of that 

379
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:01,963
wave came down to the spring constant and the mass, 

380
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:06,720
which is to say it depends exclusively on material properties of the glass.

381
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,323
By contrast, with this external cycling driving force, 

382
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:14,780
the frequency in that steady state is the same as the frequency of the light.

383
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,118
And then in our first case, the amplitude of the wave was kind of uninteresting, 

384
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:22,360
it just depends on how far you pulled the spring out to begin with.

385
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,125
But in the second case, the amplitude of this wave 

386
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,640
is actually where all the interesting stuff happens.

387
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,480
Exactly how much will this charge be oscillating in response to the light wave?

388
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,475
Again, I won't go over the full details of solving this, 

389
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:41,139
but any eager calculus students among you might enjoy going through the exercise where 

390
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:45,749
if you just guess that a solution looks like a cosine wave with the same frequency as 

391
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:50,251
the light, and you solve for the amplitude, you can get a concrete solution to this 

392
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:51,860
equation that looks like this.

393
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,586
This is worth unpacking for a bit, and just to be clear, 

394
00:23:55,586 --> 00:24:00,460
this is only describing things in the steady state, after things have gotten up and going.

395
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,000
A fully descriptive solution would be notably more complicated.

396
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,662
As I said, everything interesting here comes down to the amplitude, 

397
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:10,268
which here looks like a large collection of constants, 

398
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:14,060
most of which should be pretty intuitive if you take a moment to think about it.

399
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,773
For example, it is proportional to the strength of that incoming light wave, 

400
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,120
so the stronger the light the more the oscillations.

401
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,580
It's also proportional to the charge, which again makes sense.

402
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,319
And the real heart of the matter comes down to what's sitting in the denominator here, 

403
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,270
the difference between the square of the resonant frequency 

404
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,140
and the square of the light frequency.

405
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,756
And to build a little intuition, take a moment to think about 

406
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:39,822
what would happen if the frequency of the incoming light was 

407
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:43,140
something very close to the resonant frequency of this oscillator.

408
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,911
This is analogous to the normal situation pushing a child on a swing, 

409
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:52,860
where the frequency of your force lines up quite closely with what the swing wants to do.

410
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,682
In this case, running the simulation, notice how the oscillations of 

411
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:02,040
that particle will grow and grow and grow, becoming quite large over time.

412
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,288
Some of you may know the famous example of the Millennium Bridge in London, 

413
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:11,726
where on its opening day it started oscillating way more than the engineers expected 

414
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:12,040
it to.

415
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,020
And what was going on is that the frequency of the steps of the crowd lined up 

416
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,580
very closely with a resonant frequency, causing this worryingly high amplitude.

417
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,964
By contrast, notice what happens in the simulation if the frequency of the light, 

418
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:31,320
ωL, is something much smaller than the resonant frequency.

419
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,024
For this particular simulation it takes a little bit of a moment before 

420
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,940
things get into their full swing, eventually it finds a nice sinusoidal motion, 

421
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,220
but the amplitude of that motion is much more modest in comparison.

422
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,180
So what our equation is telling us is that the larger the difference between those 

423
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,718
frequencies, then the bigger the denominator, so the smaller the overall wiggle to that 

424
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,080
charge.

425
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,540
And again, this is something you can see in the footage with my niece.

426
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,716
As I'm applying a force with a frequency that's very different from 

427
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:06,598
what the swing wants to do, she ends up oscillating at the same frequency as my force, 

428
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,180
but she's going at a relatively low amplitude.

429
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,918
Stepping back, what this means is that as you shine light into a material, 

430
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:19,718
like glass, it's not just that it induces wiggles in the charges of that material, 

431
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:24,230
but the specific size of those wiggles depends on the frequency of the light, 

432
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,660
as a consequence of this denominator term.

433
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,515
And the more those wiggle, the bigger the size of this second order wave caused by 

434
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:36,000
that layer, which in turn causes a bigger shift to the phase of the overall wave.

435
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,753
Because a lot of different shifts to the phase are what causes 

436
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:43,256
this apparent slowdown to the light, it means that the amount that 

437
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:46,760
it will slow down ultimately depends on the frequency of the light.

438
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,800
So that is the real reason why prisms work.

439
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,591
You cannot truly explain the light separation 

440
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,440
until you get down to the driven harmonic oscillator.

441
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,657
Now, I have left out a number of details, and again, 

442
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:03,295
I encourage the curious viewers to take a look at the Feynman lectures that 

443
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:04,540
a lot of this is based on.

444
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,066
One quite important detail that would be a little criminal not to mention is that when 

445
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:13,020
we're modeling our charge as a little harmonic oscillator with this linear restoring 

446
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,020
force, there should really also be a term that depends on the velocity of that charge.

447
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,480
You might think of this as a kind of drag force.

448
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,317
This term accounts for the fact that energy from 

449
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:24,820
the incoming light wave is absorbed by the material.

450
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,822
Without it, this whole explanation would seem to imply that light always passes through 

451
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:34,155
every material, not just glass and water, when as you can tell just by looking around, 

452
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:38,140
there's all sorts of materials for which light is mostly reflected and absorbed.

453
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,294
As I mentioned at the start, folks on Patreon had numerous questions 

454
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,455
about the index of refraction, like how it can be less than one, 

455
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:49,053
and why slowing implies bending, so I made a supplemental video answering 

456
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:52,700
a handful of those questions, which should be published in just a few days.

457
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,034
In the meantime, my friend Mithuna from the channel Looking Glass Universe 

458
00:27:57,034 --> 00:28:01,043
just put out a pair of videos on the related but definitely distinct question 

459
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:04,898
of whether light slows down in a medium, not in the sense of following the 

460
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:07,571
crests of a clean pure sine wave in a steady state, 

461
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:11,066
but in the sense of trying to send information through that medium, 

462
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,660
like with a little wave packet.

463
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,473
I definitely owe the existence of this video to many conversations with her about this 

464
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:22,060
topic, and viewers here will definitely enjoy taking a look, especially at the second one.

465
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,309
By the way, some collaborators and I made this notebook that I think a lot of viewers 

466
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,140
might enjoy, and given that it's the holiday season it seems worth a quick mention.

467
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,322
The premise is that every one of the pages has a quote that's related to math, 

468
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:38,678
and I had a lot of fun curating them all, trying to constrain myself 

469
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,500
to quotes conveying some genuinely thought-provoking idea.

470
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,497
And aside from the content, I basically made the kind of notebook that I most enjoy 

471
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:50,999
taking notes in, something that's readily portable with very faint grid lines helpful 

472
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:55,240
for diagrams but otherwise unobtrusive, all bound in this nice soft faux leather.

473
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:08,109
If that seems up your alley, you can find them in the 

474
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:23,300
3blue1brown store next to a lot of other mathematical merchandise.
