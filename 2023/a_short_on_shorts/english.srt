00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
I have mixed feelings about shorts.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,480
On the one hand, lots of individual shorts are insightful and funny and even awe-inspiring.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,700
And let's be real, long-form videos on YouTube can often be bloated and shorts are necessarily

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,680
to the point, so I get the appeal.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,700
At the same time, no one I know seems to actually feel good after a long session on shorts,

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,940
or reels or TikTok or whatever.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,900
Something about the rapid barrage of instant gratification and context switching seems

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,740
to leave us feeling mentally numb.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,480
Recently, I've been posting a pile of shorts that are all adapted snippets from pre-existing

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,480
videos.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,920
And it's not just that this is the easiest way to get into the shorts feed, readily outsourceable

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,620
while I stay focused on new long-form lessons.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,920
The second ulterior motive is to offer an escape hatch.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,520
A good short is one that's thought-provoking on its own, but unless there's a way to

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,460
more deeply engage with whatever that thought is, it feels hollow.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,060
Since we can so nicely link to other videos right at the bottom of a short, I kind of

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,720
love the idea that anyone who wants to hop out of the feed and engage more deeply is

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,760
just one click away.
