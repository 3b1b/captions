I recently had a lot of fun making simulations for how the electric field responds to a moving charge.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,740
It was all for a longer video on YouTube that covers the fundamentals of what light is,

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,520
but here I just thought I'd share with you some of the pretty animations that came out of it.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,260
The full electric field is three-dimensional.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,020
It associates each point in space with a little vector telling you what force would be applied

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,360
to a unit charge if it were sitting at that point in space.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,520
The 3D fields are fun to look at, but they are a bit busy,

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,280
so often it's easier to just show a slice of that field, say on the xy plane.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,620
In the main video I talk about the underlying law used to make these simulations.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,960
It's not actually Maxwell's equations, which are the fundamental laws underlying electricity and magnetism.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,400
Instead I'm coding in another intermediate law, something that you can derive from Maxwell's equations,

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,560
but which is a little easier to wrap your mind around, both for the sake of making the animations

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,540
and also for the sake of the student trying to understand what's going on.
