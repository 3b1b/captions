00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,416
Today I have a small series of puzzles for you, and if you even remotely like math, 

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:08,360
I can essentially guarantee that the solution to each one will delight you.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,371
At the end, you and I will circle them all together into a 

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,627
broader theme about higher dimensions, both in the sense of why we care, 

5
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:17,080
and also why it's a little bit sad to think about them.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,869
But for the first half of this lesson or so, nothing 

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,360
that we do is going to touch four or more dimensions.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,350
This will start simply as a set of pure geometry 

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,960
puzzles with delightful and surprising solutions.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,185
For the first puzzle here, I want you to consider this rhombus shape, 

11
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:39,300
where the internal angles are 60 degrees and 120 degrees.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,460
If you take a lot of copies of this shape, you can tile the plane with it.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,433
And that's not unique to this rhombus, it could have different internal angles, 

14
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,621
but what's nice about this one is that there are a lot of distinct ways, 

15
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,940
with a kind of pseudo-hexagonal pattern, that you could also tile the plane.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,909
I've seen this pattern all the time out in the wild on floors or on furniture, 

17
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,720
and each time it reminds me of the puzzle I'm about to show you.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,028
If you take one of these tilings, and you ever notice that three of those 

19
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,511
rhombus shapes make a little hexagon like this, 

20
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:11,339
it gives you a chance to generate a slightly different tiling by rotating 

21
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:12,840
those three tiles 60 degrees.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,420
The result is almost the same as what you had before, but just a little bit different.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,265
And when you do that, you might notice that sometimes that 

24
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,206
creates a new hexagon that wasn't there before, 

25
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,360
that you could also rotate, taking a step to yet another one of these tilings.

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,167
So a natural question you might wonder is, is it possible to get from any one of these 

27
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:35,040
tiling patterns to another one just by using these little hexagonal rotation steps?

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,030
With a little thinking, you can see pretty quickly that the answer has to be no, 

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,716
because for example, that very first tiling I showed you, 

30
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:46,818
which is like a squished rectangular grid, has no hexagons at all, 

31
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:50,060
meaning you can't take one of these steps into or out of this pattern.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
But what if we restrain things a little bit?

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,180
What if instead of tiling the infinite plane, I present you with a hexagon, 

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,800
and all the side lengths of this hexagon are going to be some whole number, 

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,563
like 4 in this case, and I have you fill that hexagon with these little tiles, 

36
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:06,040
assuming each of those tiles has a side length of 1.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,666
Now let me ask you, is it possible to get from any tiling of this finite 

38
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,220
hexagon to any other tiling using these moves, 

39
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,241
where every time you find a small hexagon with just three of those tiles, 

40
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,600
you rotate it 60 degrees?

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,067
If the answer is no, you have to show two distinct patterns and 

42
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:25,875
explain why you can't get between them, and the natural follow-on question would be, 

43
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,160
how many fundamentally distinct patterns are there?

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,337
If the answer is yes, you have to explain how to get from any one to another, 

45
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:36,591
and the natural follow-up question would be, which two states are the farthest apart, 

46
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:40,400
in that it requires the maximum number of moves to get from one to the other?

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,900
And what is that number?

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,653
As a function of the size of the hexagon, what is the maximum possible 

49
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:49,000
number of steps that it could take to get from one state to another?

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,749
That's puzzle number one, and before just giving away the answer, 

51
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:56,202
let me present the second puzzle for you, and maybe you can mull it over in the 

52
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:56,980
back of your mind.

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,011
The second one is called the Tarski-Planck problem, and it has to do with a circle, 

54
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:06,180
say just with a radius 1, and we're going to consider strips along that circle.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,987
And what I mean by a strip here is any region that's bound by two parallel chords, 

56
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:14,235
and the quantity we'll care about is the width of that strip, 

57
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:18,740
so the distance between those two chords, which I'm going to denote with the letter d.

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,016
You might drop down multiple distinct strips on this circle, 

59
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:25,580
and they could be at various different angles, kind of crisscrossing with each other.

60
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,194
And for the question, suppose that you've dropped down enough of 

61
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:32,020
these strips that they completely cover the area of the circle.

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Every square inch of the circle has some strip covering it.

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,246
Then imagine adding together the widths of all of those strips, 

64
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:42,460
so summing over this value d for every one of those strips.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,500
And the question is what is the minimum possible value for this sum?

66
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,493
So across all of the distinct ways that you could cover the circle with 

67
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:54,660
a bunch of strips, what's the smallest that you could make this sum?

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,957
For example, a very trivial way that you could cover it is to take 

69
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:02,560
one really fat strip whose width is 2, the diameter of the circle.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,500
That entire strip covers the entire circle, so the sum of all of the widths would be 2.

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,858
Very similarly, if you just subdivided this into a whole bunch of parallel strips, 

72
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:15,181
the sum of the widths is going to just be the diameter of the circle, 

73
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,320
so that is still just 2.

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,339
So really the question here is can you do better than 2, and by how much?

75
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,840
Okay, so that is puzzle number 2.

76
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,444
Before telling you 3, 4, and 5 though, let's circle back to talk about that first one, 

77
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,940
where we are tiling the hexagon.

78
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,574
On the face of it, this is very tricky to think about, 

79
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:38,397
but there is a trick if you kind of squint your eyes, 

80
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:42,317
and if I suggestively color all of these tiles based on their orientation, 

81
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,714
where instead of thinking of this as a tiling in two dimensions, 

82
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:49,060
you can think of it as a kind of projection of a stack of cubes.

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,573
It's not too hard to see that any stack of cubes inside an n by n by 

84
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:57,387
n frame like this necessarily gives you one of these rhombus tiling patterns, 

85
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,566
but the curious viewers might enjoy taking a moment to pause and 

86
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,500
ponder and convince themselves it goes the other way around.

87
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,280
Any tiling of rhombuses necessarily has a corresponding stack of cubes.

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,476
If you do that, take a moment to think about the significance of this fundamental 

89
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:17,960
move in the puzzle, where you identify a hexagon and rotate that hexagon 60 degrees.

90
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,871
If you think of that little hexagon as the projection of a little cube, 

91
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,142
notice how if I kind of grab that cube and remove it from the diagram, 

92
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:32,075
what's left behind, this indent of that cube, involves those same three rhombuses 

93
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,640
except rotated 60 degrees.

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,590
This move of rotating hexagons when you find them is really the same thing 

95
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,640
as adding or removing cubes, and that makes this way easier to think about.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,961
For example, it becomes very clear that you can get from any pattern to any other 

97
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:50,875
pattern, because you could start by saying take all of the cubes in this diagram 

98
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,740
and remove them so that you get to a kind of neutral position that looks empty, 

99
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,040
and then add back whatever cubes you need to to get to whatever other pattern you desire.

100
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,455
It also makes it easy to think about the more quantitative follow-on question, 

101
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:06,200
which is what is the maximum number of steps that it might 

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,340
take to get from one configuration to another.

103
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,215
Realizing that each move corresponds to adding or removing a cube, 

104
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:16,835
the biggest number of steps is to go from the empty configuration 

105
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,620
to the full configuration, and that requires n cubed different steps.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,553
What I like about this is that we have this purely two-dimensional question, 

107
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:29,248
and a very nice insight came from thinking as three-dimensional creatures, 

108
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:33,190
but the fact that the numerical answer to this question has that little cube in 

109
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,624
it is an indication that the three-dimensionality really is baked into the puzzle itself, 

110
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:41,320
it's not coming from some bias that we have as three-dimensional creatures.

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,999
With this idea of stepping into a higher dimension in mind, 

112
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:47,821
now take another look at that second puzzle that we have, 

113
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,060
covering the unit disk with a bunch of strips.

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,017
If you do pause and take a moment trying to think about this puzzle, 

115
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:59,215
and you explore alternate strategies to the parallel strips, 

116
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:03,776
what you might find is that it's very hard to find anything that gets even close to 2, 

117
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:07,498
much less lower than it, so you might suspect that the parallel strips 

118
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:11,640
are the best that you can do, that 2 is the minimum possible value for the sum.

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
But how would you prove something like that?

120
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,430
When you're in this vast space of all possible coverings, 

121
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,080
how could you prove that there's not some extra clever strategy that you're just missing?

122
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,982
This main constraint that the strips have to cover the circle 

123
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:29,621
means that the area of all of those strips, if you add them together, 

124
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:32,480
has to be at least the area of the circle, which is pi.

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,464
So that's something to work with, but it's a little bit awkward, 

126
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:40,733
because you can't directly relate the area of the strip to its width without knowing 

127
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,140
where on the circle it sits.

128
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,621
A strip with a given width would have a bigger area 

129
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,960
near the center than if it was close to the edge.

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,189
What would be really helpful is if the area of that strip was simply 

131
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:54,674
proportional to its width, because in that case you could directly 

132
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,160
relate the sum of all of the areas to the sum of all of the widths.

133
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,433
And while this is not true in two dimensions, the magic is that it becomes 

134
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,760
true if you project everything up onto a hemisphere sitting above the circle.

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,666
This is not at all obvious, but if you look at the width of this strip 

136
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:15,152
on this three-dimensional hemisphere, which we'll call d, 

137
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:20,020
the area of that strip up in three dimensions like this happens to be pi times d.

138
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,042
Importantly, it doesn't matter where the strip is, 

139
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,816
it could be going over the center or closer to the edge, 

140
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,520
the area only depends on the width.

141
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,610
This might feel like a fact drawn completely from out of the blue, 

142
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,510
but regular channel viewers will have at least some chance to recognize this, 

143
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,360
because it's related to a really nice proof for the surface area of a sphere.

144
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,780
This was a proof due to Archimedes, we covered it in a different video.

145
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,746
The big idea there is to consider a cylinder with the same radius as that sphere, 

146
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:51,576
sort of hugging tightly around the sphere, and then to analyze how if 

147
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,312
you look at a little patch of area on the sphere, 

148
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:58,580
and you project it outward onto this cylinder, the area actually won't change.

149
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,316
The high-level idea is that along lines of latitude, 

150
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:05,240
that little patch of area gets stretched out, but along lines of longitude, 

151
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,803
it actually gets squished down because of the angle that it sits at, 

152
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:11,540
and those two effects happen to cancel out precisely.

153
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,102
And then once you know that projecting out onto this cylinder preserves areas, 

154
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:18,320
analyzing those areas becomes a lot simpler.

155
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,819
So looking back at our little strip, let me go ahead and draw the rest of the sphere, 

156
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:25,660
sort of doubling the area of that strip, and then reorienting it 

157
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,540
to match the animations I was just showing.

158
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,703
If you know that projecting this out onto the cylinder preserves the area, 

159
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:35,940
then it becomes very clear that it doesn't matter where on the sphere that strip is.

160
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,592
Whether it's close to the pole or close to the equator, 

161
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:44,640
the area of that projection onto the cylinder is the circumference times the thickness, 

162
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,960
2 pi r times the width.

163
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,549
So wrapping it all up, the way this is relevant to the original puzzle is you say, 

164
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,448
consider any covering of the circle with a bunch of strips, 

165
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:57,458
which you can project upwards to be a covering of the hemisphere with all of these 

166
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,280
projected strips.

167
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,923
The sum of all of those areas looks like adding up pi times d for each one, 

168
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:06,944
and you can factor out that pi, but you also know that the sum of those 

169
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:11,300
areas has to be at least the area of the hemisphere, which will be 2 times pi.

170
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,664
Therefore, the sum of the widths can never be below 2, and once again, 

171
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:19,217
we've taken this problem which is very tricky to analyze directly, 

172
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:23,460
but leveraged intuitions glean from living lives as three-dimensional creatures.

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,700
This next example has a little bit of a story behind it.

174
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,854
So I was at the International Math Olympiad earlier this year, 

175
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:34,254
I was giving some lectures to the students participating in the contest, 

176
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:37,608
and one of those lectures was essentially the video I'm giving you now, 

177
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:41,242
kind of going through these examples of puzzles where you're in one dimension 

178
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,360
but you have to step up.

179
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,560
And in the middle, I asked the students in the audience for more examples like this.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,593
And I was reasonably confident that at least one of them would mention the 

181
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:54,378
example I'm about to show you, because there's a really nice Numberphile video 

182
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:58,210
about this one, it's by Tadashi Tokeda, who is always great, but as you'll see, 

183
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,900
there was actually a little bit of a wrinkle that I wasn't anticipating here.

184
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,297
The setup for this problem is that we have three different circles, 

185
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:11,159
just in two-dimensional space, and what we're going to do is draw the external tangents 

186
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,320
to each pair of them.

187
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,815
So for example, here on the green and the red circle, 

188
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,160
we've got these external tangents, and the thing we care about is where they intersect.

189
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,731
Similarly, I'll take the intersections of the external tangents 

190
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:26,440
for that blue and the tangents on the green and the blue one.

191
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,666
And if I take a moment to just play around with the positions of these circles and 

192
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,835
invite you to notice those three different points of intersection, 

193
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:37,761
anything special about it, you might be able to guess what the relevant theorem or 

194
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:38,660
the puzzle here is.

195
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,242
Basically, no matter where I position them, all 

196
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:45,100
three of those points seem to fit on a given line.

197
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,593
The notion of external tangents doesn't really make sense when one circle is inside the 

198
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:51,772
other, so let's assume that that doesn't happen, 

199
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,640
though we can revisit that a little later.

200
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,969
And another assumption you might want to make is that no two circles have the same size, 

201
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:00,075
because if two of them did have the same size, 

202
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:02,720
those external tangents are parallel, they don't intersect.

203
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,335
You could make this sensible with the notion of projective geometry, 

204
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:09,745
which takes seriously the idea of points at infinity, but for our purposes, 

205
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:13,020
think of three circles that don't intersect and don't have the same size.

206
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,000
The claim, the theorem, the thing you need to prove is that those three 

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,700
intersection points of the external tangents always fall on the same line.

208
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,760
At this point, you know the theme, we're going to take a step up into the third dimension.

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,660
Namely, imagine that each one of these circles is the equator of some sphere.

210
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,042
Now around any given pair of those spheres, like this green 

211
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,810
one and the blue one for example, there are a whole bunch of 

212
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,760
different external tangents that all intersect at the same point.

213
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,060
You essentially just rotate the two that we had about the axis between these two.

214
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,935
And then similarly for each other pair of spheres, like that blue one and the red one, 

215
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,409
there's this cone of external tangents all intersecting at that point, 

216
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:55,980
and between the red and the green one, another cone of external tangents.

217
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
You might ask, why on earth would this be helpful?

218
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,797
And the key is to think about a plane that's kind 

219
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:04,260
of resting on top of all three of those balls.

220
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,720
I claim that this plane goes through the three different points that we care about.

221
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,510
And the reason basically is if you draw this line between the tangency point of the 

222
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,569
plane on the green sphere, let's say, and the tangency point on the blue sphere, 

223
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,880
that's one of those external tangents that goes through this little intersection here.

224
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,289
And then similarly, if you draw the line on the tangency point 

225
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:28,013
of the sphere for the red and the green, it's one of those 

226
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:31,200
external tangents that goes to the other one, and likewise over here.

227
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,967
We have another line on that plane that passes through the point, 

228
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:37,120
so in particular the plane itself has to go through all three of these points.

229
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,011
But those three points also live on a different shared plane, 

230
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:44,620
namely the plane of the original problem where the three circles lived.

231
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,106
So they have to live somewhere on the intersection between these two planes, 

232
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:53,900
and any two planes in 3D space that aren't parallel to each other intersect along a line.

233
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,620
Therefore, the three points that we care about have to always sit on a line.

234
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,268
This is more or less the content of that Numberphile video, 

235
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:04,781
and leave it to one of those clever IMO students to point out how it's 

236
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:08,640
actually not quite a valid argument, in the sense that it's not fully general.

237
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,216
One of the students raised her hand and pointed out that if you have 

238
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:15,126
a setup where one of the spheres is smaller than the other two, 

239
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:18,854
and you place it somewhere in the middle here, then if you try to play this game, 

240
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:21,900
there is no way for that plane to rest on top of all three of them.

241
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,280
You might imagine kind of rotating it around those two big ones.

242
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,170
So in other words, the argument does work for certain positions of those three circles, 

243
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,860
but it doesn't work for all of them.

244
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,669
And then after that talk, the deputy leader for the Slovakian team 

245
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,028
mentioned to me that there is actually a way that you can save this 

246
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:44,980
proof and preserve the overall lesson of taking a step into the third dimension.

247
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,220
The key is that instead of using spheres, we should really be using cones.

248
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,028
So now we have these three different cones, each of which has a base at one of 

249
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:57,334
the circles, and the only thing that we need is that the angles at the top of 

250
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:00,640
each one of them are the same, so that they're three different similar shapes.

251
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,340
Now consider the line passing through the tip of two different ones of those cones.

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,574
I claim that that line also passes through the intersection point 

253
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:13,040
between the external tangents of the circles that we care about.

254
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,793
The reason is that this point is what's called 

255
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,980
the center of similarity for those two shapes.

256
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,559
What I mean by that is that if you scale the big version of this shape about that point, 

257
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,520
then at some point along the way, it coincides with the smaller version of that shape.

258
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,325
From this perspective, you can see how the line through the tips 

259
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,640
of those cones has to pass through that center of similarity.

260
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,668
If we look from above, you can see how the external 

261
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,520
tangents also pass through that center.

262
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,216
Essentially the diagram that consists of this little circle with those external 

263
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:45,107
tangents intersecting at that point is a scaled-down version of the diagram 

264
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:49,460
consisting of this big circle and those external tangents intersecting at that point.

265
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,570
And then similarly, if you look at the lines passing through the tips of any other 

266
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,880
pair of cones, those lines will correspond to another one of those intersection points.

267
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,040
Now we can talk about the plane that passes through the tips of all of these three cones.

268
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,416
And there's no more worry about generality, because any three points in space, 

269
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,500
no matter where they are, have some plane that passes through them.

270
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,925
For example, if we move that smaller circle into the problem position from earlier, 

271
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:16,720
there's no issue.

272
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,560
The three different tips of the cones uniquely determine a plane.

273
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,223
That plane intersects with the xy plane, at least assuming the 

274
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:26,172
three cones don't all have the same size, and the line of 

275
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:29,580
intersection is exactly the line that we're trying to prove exists.

276
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,860
If any of you know the origin for this fixed version of the argument, let me know.

277
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,731
That leader of the Slovakian team mentioned that he had heard 

278
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:39,200
it from someone else but couldn't quite remember from where.

279
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,087
There's another benefit you get by shifting the focus to the center of similarity 

280
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,700
rather than describing these points as the intersection of external tangents.

281
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,740
In this framing, it's perfectly sensible for one circle to sit inside the other.

282
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,380
Even if you can't draw external tangents, there's still some point such that 

283
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,340
if you scale one circle about that point, it will coincide with the other.

284
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,500
This actually made it way easier to program.

285
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,951
Notice how wherever I put these circles, we always 

286
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,800
get these three points that fall on a line.

287
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,020
In fact, these don't even need to be circles.

288
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,359
They could be any three similar shapes as long as they're all in the same orientation.

289
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,339
And you can say those three centers of similarity always must fall on a line.

290
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,241
And you can use essentially that same argument using cones to show this, 

291
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,400
except instead of cones, you would have some kind of pyramid shape.

292
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,070
At this point, having logged three wonderful examples of two-dimensional 

293
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,891
puzzles that somehow leverage a three-dimensional insight, 

294
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:36,333
a natural question you might ask is whether there's a three-dimensional 

295
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,920
puzzle that somehow involves stepping up into four dimensions to answer it.

296
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,920
The last two puzzles I want to bring up offer attempts at an answer to that.

297
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,851
For this next one, imagine that you have four different points in 

298
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:51,440
three-dimensional space and they form the vertices of a tetrahedron, 

299
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,340
basically the shapes such that those four different points are its corners.

300
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,325
In principle, if you know the coordinates of those points, 

301
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:00,240
you know everything you need to about this shape.

302
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,948
But the challenge I present to you is to write an explicit formula for the volume 

303
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:09,080
of this tetrahedron in terms of the coordinates of those four different points.

304
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,960
And this time, I'm actually not going to show you the full answer to this puzzle.

305
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,849
I will give you a major spoiler, which is that one elegant way to view it involves 

306
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,702
thinking about the determinant of a certain 4x4 matrix, 

307
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:25,186
and I'll also suggest that it would be very helpful to try thinking about the analogous 

308
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:29,364
puzzle one dimension lower, where you're finding the area of a triangle given the 

309
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:30,740
coordinates of its corners.

310
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,946
The main reason I don't want to give the full answer right away is that solving 

311
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:40,243
this puzzle and its analogs in various different dimensions actually offers a 

312
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:44,540
really nice explanation for why the formula for the determinant is what it is.

313
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,764
And as such, I think that distilling that into its own little video 

314
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,800
should make a really nice addition to the linear algebra series.

315
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,246
So skipping now to the very last example, rather than beginning with 

316
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:58,702
a puzzle and seeking an insight, what we're going to do is start with 

317
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:02,060
the insight and see if we can try to construct the puzzle around it.

318
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,569
Looking back at the first puzzle that we did, you might have the idea that 

319
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:10,780
it would be fun to try finding an equivalent of this but one dimension higher.

320
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,603
What is the three-dimensional tiling pattern where a four-dimensional creature could 

321
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:20,255
stare at it, squint their eyes, and somehow see it as a stack of four-dimensional 

322
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:20,880
hypercubes?

323
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,159
And instead of asking about rotating these hexagons whenever we find them, 

324
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,302
what is the equivalent move that we could understand as 3D creatures, 

325
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:35,333
but which the 4D creature could somehow think about as adding or removing hypercubes 

326
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,280
from that stack?

327
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,627
This is certainly a very mind-bending exercise, 

328
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:43,852
and the puzzle that we'll ultimately construct is maybe a little contrived, 

329
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:48,576
but I found it super fun to think through, and it definitely gave me a new intuition 

330
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:51,300
for a certain 3D shape that I had not had before.

331
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,544
To start off, it helps to put some numbers to the way they were thinking about a cube, 

332
00:19:56,544 --> 00:20:00,427
where one natural choice is to put it in 3D space such that one vertex sits 

333
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:04,259
at the origin, coordinates 0, 0, 0, and then all of the other vertices are 

334
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,580
kind of every combination of 0s and 1s that you can come up with.

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,976
And notice how I'm drawing an edge between two different 

336
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,474
vertices whenever they only differ in one coordinate, for example, 

337
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:17,660
differing only in the x-direction or only in the y-direction.

338
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
For a four-dimensional cube, you could do the same thing in principle.

339
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,654
Your coordinates are lists of four numbers, and all of the vertices of 

340
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:29,780
the cube are going to be every possible combination that involves 0s and 1s.

341
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,040
What I'm showing right now is just the three-dimensional base of that hypercube.

342
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,580
It's analogous to the base square on our cube, where the z-coordinate is all 0.

343
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,680
Notice how here that last coordinate is 0 for all of them.

344
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,996
Even if we struggle to visualize it, in principle the rest of the hypercube 

345
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,837
comes from increasing that last coordinate by one unit, 

346
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:51,678
stepping in some direction that we can't quite imagine, 

347
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:55,382
which gives us this other 3D cube, which is the analogue of the top face 

348
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,260
that we might have looked at earlier.

349
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,463
And again, the rule with the edges is to connect any pair 

350
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:03,160
of vertices that differ only in one of those coordinates.

351
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,177
The tiling puzzle we did involved looking at these cubes from a very specific direction, 

352
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:12,249
where we were kind of staring down this diagonal direction, 

353
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:15,220
and the way it projects onto our eye looks like a hexagon.

354
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,604
One way to think about this that lends itself to actually coding it up for a higher 

355
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:23,825
dimension is to consider the vector with coordinates 1, 1, 

356
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:28,137
1 sitting in that diagonal direction, and projecting everything onto the plane 

357
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:29,720
perpendicular to that vector.

358
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,930
You can write an explicit formula for this that basically takes any 

359
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,080
point and kind of subtracts off its component along that direction.

360
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,098
More generally, if you had a whole stack of cubes and you project them 

361
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:46,720
all down on this direction, it creates for you this hexagonal grid.

362
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,612
With the 4D cube, even though again we struggle to really think about what it looks like, 

363
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,295
we can at least have the computer play the same game, 

364
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:59,127
where I'll consider the 4-dimensional vector 1, 1, 1, 1, 

365
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:02,506
and project everything onto the space perpendicular to that vector, 

366
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,240
which will be a 3-dimensional subspace of 4 dimensions.

367
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,040
When I do that for this wire frame of the 4-dimensional cube, here's what it looks like.

368
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,341
It's this very beautiful and symmetric shape, and if instead of the wire frame 

369
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:18,300
I make it solid, this has a special name, it's called a rhombic dodecahedron.

370
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,764
There's a really nice video with Matt Parker and Adam Savage featuring a 

371
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:26,614
rhombic dodecahedron, where they construct this beautiful lightbox that 

372
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:30,840
features the fact that you can tessellate 3-dimensional space using this shape.

373
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,684
That's really not obvious, at least to me, when I just look at it, 

374
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:37,899
but if you know that this is a natural projection of a hypercube, 

375
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,725
that actually tells you that it must tessellate 3D space, 

376
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:43,600
because you could project down a stack of those hypercubes.

377
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,744
In our puzzle, we weren't just looking at the wire frames for these cubes, 

378
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:52,328
they had actual square faces, and when we stare down one of these corners, 

379
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:54,240
we only really see three of those faces.

380
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,631
When there is a cube, it's the three faces pointed out, 

381
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:01,168
and when there was no cube in that position, we had the kind of indent, 

382
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:03,920
which is like the three faces of the cube on the inside.

383
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,078
Projecting those three faces down is what gives 

384
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,440
us those three rhombuses that form a hexagon.

385
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,392
To think through the analog of this one dimension up, 

386
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,420
again it helps to put some numbers to things.

387
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,409
Let me draw these three different basis vectors that span the cube, 

388
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:22,120
the unit vectors in the x direction, the y direction, and the z direction.

389
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,140
Notice how each one of these inner faces corresponds to a pair of those basis vectors.

390
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,764
The analogous game that we can play one dimension up is to take the four different 

391
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:38,880
basis vectors up there and project them down to 3D, again along this diagonal direction.

392
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,835
This is analogous to projecting those three basis vectors 

393
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,920
into the hexagon so that they all sit 120 degrees apart.

394
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,316
And now, instead of talking about the square faces of the cube getting 

395
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:54,560
projected as rhombuses, we think about the cubical cells of that hypercube.

396
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,562
Each one in this case corresponds to a way that you 

397
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,900
could choose three out of those four basis vectors.

398
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,146
Each of them is this kind of squished cube shape, 

399
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:08,160
and the four of them together fit very nicely to create this rhombic dodecahedron.

400
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,407
Now, in our original puzzle, the game was whenever you see this 

401
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:18,080
hexagon built out of the three rhombuses, you rotate it 60 degrees.

402
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,020
But we're going to have to change how we think about that move.

403
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,313
Notice how when I go from the inner faces of the cube to the outer faces, 

404
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:28,800
I can slide each one of them in a direction perpendicular to that face.

405
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,388
Down on the projection, what that looks like is 

406
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,920
sliding each one of these rhombuses through the origin.

407
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,228
We can play the same game with the projections of those cubes in four dimensions, 

408
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:45,402
where if you take each one of these four and let it slide through the origin, 

409
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,720
it gives you a distinct way to tile that rhombic dodecahedron.

410
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,413
So with all of that as setup, here is the absurd puzzle that you could 

411
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:59,540
present to someone next time you find yourself at a nerdy cocktail party.

412
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,360
First you describe this squished cube shape here.

413
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,286
It involves taking six of those rhombuses that we 

414
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,880
had earlier and forming a polyhedron out of them.

415
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,397
You say, imagine this has a side length of one, 

416
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:16,706
and you're going to use many copies of this shape to tile a big rhombic dodecahedron 

417
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:19,080
with some kind of integer side length.

418
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,326
The game is that every time inside this big tiling you find a small 1x1x1 rhombic 

419
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:28,880
dodecahedron, you make this move where each piece can slide through the middle.

420
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,308
And then for the puzzle, you ask what is the maximum number 

421
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:35,480
of moves that it might take to get from one tiling to another.

422
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,951
This is absurdly confusing to think about, but if you somehow know that this is 

423
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:45,678
all a projection of a stack of hypercubes, it can lead you to conclude the answer 

424
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:50,520
has to be the size of that big rhombic dodecahedron, let's call it n to the power 4.

425
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,780
Zooming out a bit, all of these puzzles are really just for fun.

426
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,497
Aside from sharing them with nerdy friends at parties, 

427
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:00,340
there's not really a lot of direct utility.

428
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,959
But they illustrate a much broader phenomenon in math, 

429
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:08,661
where constructs in some higher dimension can be bizarrely relevant to solving problems 

430
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:11,493
more easily, either in a lower number of dimensions, 

431
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,700
or even solving problems that don't seem geometric at first.

432
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,604
For example, there's an extension of the complex numbers that naturally 

433
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:21,490
live up in four dimensions, they're called the quaternions, 

434
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,340
and they offer a really elegant way to encode and to work with three dimensions.

435
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,324
You don't have to understand four dimensions to work with them, 

436
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:33,180
in the description I'll give you some links to some really nice videos to show 

437
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,085
practically working with quaternions, but they are doing something very special 

438
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:41,234
up in four dimensions, rotating a hypersphere in a way that's not just rigid motion, 

439
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:45,140
but a kind of extra rigidity unlike anything we know in two or three dimensions.

440
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,576
If you're curious, I made a whole video and then a sequence of interactive 

441
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:53,260
videos a while back trying to understand what exactly that 4D motion is.

442
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,214
Another example, if you step up into 24 dimensions, 

443
00:26:57,214 --> 00:27:01,129
is how there's this unusually elegant way to pack spheres together, 

444
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:05,045
and that weird high dimensional sphere packing is very closely tied 

445
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:09,940
to a type of error correction code that was actually used on the Voyager spacecrafts.

446
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,462
If you scale up your dimensions even further, something funny starts 

447
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,964
to happen with the statistics of random vectors, 

448
00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:20,560
where a pair of random vectors will have a very high chance of being nearly perpendicular.

449
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,786
In the series on neural networks, I mentioned how this fact could be relevant 

450
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:28,293
to explaining why large language models perform so much better at scale, 

451
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:32,280
and this is a fact that's also very relevant to a number of compression algorithms.

452
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,211
But the reason that these puzzles I've laid out make me feel a little sad thinking about 

453
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:41,300
four dimensional geometry is that there's a difference between analysis and intuition.

454
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,450
You and I can stare at this tiling of rhombuses, 

455
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,800
squint our eyes, and somehow think of it as a stack of cubes.

456
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,149
If you've ever pondered spheres and their surface area, 

457
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:55,443
you have at least a chance for making this creative leap when you're faced with that 

458
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,060
puzzle about strips on a circle.

459
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,576
In trying to prove that three points sit on a line, 

460
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:04,980
you and I can think about a line as an intersection of two planes in 3D space.

461
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,974
That's not some opaque consequence of linear algebra, 

462
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:10,780
it's something we can really picture in our mind's eye.

463
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,294
All of the examples I know of that use even higher dimensions to 

464
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:19,160
solve problems don't really involve intuition in quite the same way.

465
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,212
There might be an analogy with lower dimensions, and analogies can be kind of dangerous, 

466
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:27,520
but the line of reasoning ultimately has to be purely analysis.

467
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,040
To be clear, that's not a bad thing.

468
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,140
Ultimately all of the rigor in any argument you make has to come from analysis.

469
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,000
But analysis without intuition is daunting.

470
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,161
The space of all possible logical moves you can make in the 

471
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:46,120
pursuit of a proof is often too vast to explore in a reasonable time.

Intuition is what offers the guiding lights telling you which paths are worth trying.

473
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,809
What I'm jealous of, and a little bit sad about, 

474
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:59,604
is the thought that there might be problems in three dimensions where somehow squinting 

475
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:04,344
your eyes as a four-dimensional creature or even higher would offer some guiding light 

476
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,360
that, to you and me, is inaccessible.

477
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,860
Quick note for those of you supporting on Patreon, 

478
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,639
or for those of you who have thought about maybe joining to support the channel,

I made a quick bonus supplement video to this one showing two more puzzles that have 

480
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:23,340
the same vibe where there's a question in two dimensions but the answer somehow 

481
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,020
involves three-dimensional thinking.

482
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,420
It's quick and casual, but I think you'll like the problems, so see the links below.
