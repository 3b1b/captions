1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Last year, Grant gave the math department's Michael E.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,420
Moody lecture on where math and physics collide.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,400
He explored unexpected connections between kinematics, optics, and quantum computing.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,076
Our students loved his talk, and the senior class voted 

5
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:18,940
overwhelmingly to ask him back as commencement speaker.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,532
Grant has said that he seeks to educate and inspire 

7
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:26,840
the world with beauty and the power of mathematics.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,060
He certainly has inspired many of us here at Harvey Mudd.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,040
Please join me in welcoming Grant Sanderson.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
Thank you President Nempahrd for that very warm introduction and for inviting me.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,260
And thank you to the class of 2024 for including me in such a special day.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,520
I had the joy of getting to know many of you last year on this visit.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,234
And I distinctly remember coming away with the feeling 

14
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,900
that a future in your hands is a bright future indeed.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,406
For those in the audience who don't know who I am, 

16
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:09,240
I focus on making videos about mathematics with an emphasis on visualizations.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,760
It's a weird job.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,140
I do love it though, and it's no exaggeration to describe it as a dream job.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,669
And a common clichÃ© is for someone who is lucky enough to land in a dream job, 

20
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:24,478
to stand confidently in front of a group of fledgling graduates, 

21
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,940
and to compel them to follow their dreams.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,800
Frankly, on its own, I don't think this is very good advice.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,200
To be clear, there is truth behind the clichÃ©.

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,300
It is true that those who make the biggest ripples are the ones who are fueled by passion.

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,873
It is true that the life that you live is much more 

26
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:45,300
enjoyable if you can find something doing what you love.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,040
And it's also true that you shouldn't feel shackled by societal constraints.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,199
But for one thing, not everyone has a pre-baked 

29
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,080
dream sitting there waiting to be followed.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,580
That's completely okay.

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,462
And even if you are one of the lucky ones who has a passion that you want to roll 

32
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:04,172
into a career, I think there are a few pragmatic concerns that don't always fit 

33
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:08,160
very neatly into an inspirational speech that are required to make this actually work.

34
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,868
Now, I know I'm talking to a very nerdy audience, 

35
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:16,249
so I'm tempted to describe my aims here a little bit more mathematically precisely, 

36
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,857
where in the vector space of all possible advice, 

37
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:23,500
if you consider the follow your dreams vector, I want to explore its orthogonal subspace.

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,940
Maybe though, it's better if I just start with a story.

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,800
Before I entered college, I was one of those who knew what I wanted to major in.

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,540
There's no surprises here, it was math.

41
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,900
This was a topic that I had loved for a long time, as long as I can remember.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,198
When I was in college, I was plenty seduced by the adjacent field of computer 

43
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:46,120
science and programming, and I would spend my summers interning at software startups.

44
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,305
But I distinctly remember coming back at the end of each of those summers and thinking, 

45
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:53,820
man, you know what I really want to do with my life, is spend more time doing math.

46
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,780
So I had a passion, I had something I would want to follow.

47
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,409
But in hindsight, that passion was a lot more arbitrary and maybe a 

48
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,740
little more self-centered than I would have liked to admit at the time.

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Why did I love math?

50
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,041
You know, if I'm honest, I think it had its roots in the fact that when I was young, 

51
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,375
the adults emphasized this is an important topic to learn, 

52
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,720
and they told me I was good at it.

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
This makes me spend more time with it.

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,372
Spending time with something is how you get better at something, 

55
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:22,100
and that kicks off a positive feedback loop, in both senses of the word positive feedback.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,040
Now, as time went on, I do believe it became less about perceptions when I was in college.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,688
I remember genuinely enjoying the aesthetic delights 

58
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:31,960
that beautiful math problem solving has to have.

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,157
But thinking of it as a career ambition, not just a hobby, 

60
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:40,041
this had the fatal flaw that I was viewing the world through a lens of what I 

61
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:44,024
personally enjoyed, not giving enough weight to a plan for how exactly it would 

62
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,020
add value to others.

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,592
I don't know if you felt it yet, but today marks 

64
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:51,020
a day in your life when a fundamental goal changes.

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,840
When you're a student, the fundamental goal is to grow, to learn, to become better.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,846
So many institutions and structures around you are there to support you 

67
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:03,100
in growing and learning and getting better and to reward you for doing so.

68
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,701
In life after college, the goal changes a little, 

69
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:10,500
and success hinges on how effectively you're able to add value to others.

70
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,300
Now, these aren't at odds with each other.

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,720
In fact, they go hand in hand.

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,710
You're much better positioned to make a difference if you're armed 

73
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,300
with an expertise and if you spend your life honing that expertise.

74
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,806
But there is a big difference between personal growth being 

75
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:27,080
the end in and of itself versus being a means to an end.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,780
By way of comparison, I also loved the violin when I was growing up.

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,080
And let's take a moment to imagine two distinct music students.

78
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm going to name them Paganini and Taylor.

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,100
Both of them are talented, very talented, but Paganini pushes for technical excellence.

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
He tries to perfect virtuosically challenging pieces.

81
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,620
Taylor strives to write music that speaks to people, that resonates with them emotionally.

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Now, in a music school, Paganini is going to get the better grades every time.

83
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,460
He's always going to get the better position.

84
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,100
But pursuing music careers, Taylor is at the clear advantage.

85
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,620
My first piece of advice, something I would have told myself I could go back in time 

86
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,517
and be in the seat where you are now, is that if you have a passion that you want 

87
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:14,462
to incorporate into a career, take a step back and recognize the fact that this is 

88
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:18,360
a passion that grew in a time of your life when the goal was to learn and to grow.

89
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,665
But you're transitioning to a period when the 

90
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,920
primary aim shifts to adding value to others.

91
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,702
The clichÃ© to follow your dreams overlooks how critical it is that 

92
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,220
the dreams you have are about something more than just yourself.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,410
Those who excel in their first jobs are the ones who make life easier for 

94
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,420
everyone around them, even when it involves doing things they don't love.

95
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,213
Those who excel in PhD programs are the ones who recognize how their work fits into a 

96
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:47,300
broader research community, not just the ones who view it as the next chapter in school.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,677
The successful entrepreneurs are the ones who have a relentless 

98
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:53,994
focus on making sure that what they have to sell is what people want to buy, 

99
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:56,580
not just those who are looking to make something impressive.

100
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,739
Now, for some people when you hear the words follow your dreams, 

101
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,340
it falls flat because you don't have a defining passion.

102
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,440
Like I said earlier, that's completely okay.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,580
If anything, it might put you at an advantage.

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,179
I think you'll do just as well if you start by seeking out opportunities where 

105
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:15,980
the skills that you've developed here intersect with adding values to others.

106
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And from there, I promise the passion will follow.

107
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,320
One of the best pieces of advice I remember receiving from 

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,200
a friend many years ago is that action precedes motivation.

109
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,280
This is often useful on a much smaller scale.

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,740
We feel most awake after getting out of bed, not before.

111
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,100
A drive to exercise comes from the habit of exercising.

112
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,440
It doesn't go the other way around.

113
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,595
But I think the idea that action precedes motivation applies 

114
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:42,340
to this bigger question of finding a career doing what you love.

115
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,520
These days, I do love making videos, and I really do love teaching.

116
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,600
But when I was finishing college, I had no penchant or experience with videos at all.

117
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,562
And my interest in teaching was honestly only 

118
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:57,240
insofar as it scratched this itch to do more math.

119
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,124
It was only by stumbling into a wacky career where 

120
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,580
I was doing both of them that I came to love them.

121
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,105
Now, in my own story, what happened after college involves a fair bit of luck, 

122
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,100
but luck can come in a lot of different forms.

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,014
And I think with a little bit of foresight, you can actually 

124
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,320
avoid having to rely on chance in quite the same way.

125
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,544
There's a post I like on the webcomic XKCD that shows a man standing on a stage, 

126
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,680
and he has bags of cash surrounding him.

127
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,580
Never stop buying lottery tickets, he says.

128
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,670
No matter what people tell you, I failed again and again, but I never gave up, 

129
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,660
and here I am as proof that if you put in the time, it pays off.

130
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,817
The caption notes that every inspirational speech 

131
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:38,320
should come with a disclaimer about survivorship bias.

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,160
The obvious way that Follow Your Dreams is susceptible to survivorship bias 

133
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,422
is that for all of the high-risk, high-reward paths, things like professional athletics, 

134
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:51,392
starting a social media company, making a career in the arts, 

135
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:55,320
it's only the few who rise to the top who are in a position to give advice at all.

136
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,380
But there's also a more subtle way that survivorship bias applies here.

137
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,380
It's not just about the odds of winning a particular game.

138
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,474
It has to do with whether the game you choose to 

139
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:09,180
play meshes well with the way that the future unfolds.

140
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,781
If you were a software enthusiast in the late 1980s, 

141
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:16,640
you would be well poised to ride the dot-com boom in the decade that followed.

142
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,688
If you were someone with a niche interest and an act for film production, 

143
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:23,912
you would find yourself with an unexpected opportunity when YouTube 

144
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:26,900
and other film-sharing platforms started to rise in prominence.

145
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,211
When I was finishing my undergrad, one of these ways that I scratched 

146
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,623
that itch to do more math was to hack together a very rudimentary Python 

147
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:37,941
library for making math visualizations, and I used it to make a couple 

148
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:41,539
videos about neat proofs and problems that I enjoyed and posting them online.

149
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,100
I was not planning for this to be a career.

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,425
I had an appreciation for how valuable personal projects are, 

151
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,040
but it didn't go much beyond that.

152
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,348
This led to conversations with Khan Academy, a group I had great respect for, 

153
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:56,260
and it turned into a job there, making more lessons online.

154
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,166
In the meantime, I continued my own channel as a side hobby, and it didn't blow up, 

155
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,872
but there was a very modest growth of others who enjoyed the same kind of 

156
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:09,180
visualizations that I did, and I saw it in just a steady take-up in the audience size.

157
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,659
Now, my original plan, I think, was to spend a year or two doing this online 

158
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,080
education stuff, working at Khan Academy, and maybe returning to do a PhD.

159
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,247
But as time went on, something between the gratitude that I saw from 

160
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:24,671
many students around the planet for the lessons I put out and the slow 

161
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:28,144
and steady growth on my own channel led me to doubling down and forming 

162
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:31,520
a somewhat unorthodox career in online lessons and math visualization.

163
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,563
Now, looking back, it would feel very incomplete if I were to 

164
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:38,691
somehow ascribe the success that I found to the extent there was 

165
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,820
any to the fact that I was following a dream, pursuing a passion.

166
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Passion plays into it.

167
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,166
You can't have good lessons without a teacher who cares, 

168
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,060
but we can't ignore the other factors at play.

169
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,198
I already brought up the biggest one, success is a function of the value 

170
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,803
you bring to others, so a pursuit equally fueled by love, 

171
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,036
but which did nothing to help or to entertain people just wouldn't have 

172
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:58,980
had a chance to work.

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,720
But another factor I want to focus on is how I was very lucky with the timing.

174
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,167
If I had been born 10 years earlier, I don't think I could have reached the same 

175
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,869
number of people posting lessons on a much more infant version of the internet, 

176
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:15,663
where there was less infrastructure that could have existed to help form a career 

177
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:16,080
doing so.

178
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,760
If I had started 10 years later, the space would have been a lot more saturated.

179
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,182
So another piece of advice that I'd like to offer, 

180
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:27,430
another little ingredient that makes following your dreams a little more likely to work 

181
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,630
out is to ask yourself what's possible now that wasn't possible 10 years ago and which 

182
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,320
might get harder 10 years from now.

183
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,620
There are more opportunities in a less crowded landscape.

184
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,909
There are more chances to grow if you're part of a rising tide, 

185
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:43,096
but this requires pushing past the inevitable discomfort that 

186
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:46,180
comes from following a path that has little to no precedent.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,750
Now next, I want to take a moment to talk about whose dreams 

188
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,500
you should be thinking about, because it's not just your own.

189
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,217
When I was visiting Harvey Mudd last year, I had the pleasure of 

190
00:10:57,217 --> 00:11:00,470
talking to one of the gems in your math department, Talithia Williams, 

191
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,540
and I asked her, hey, what made you pursue math in the first place?

192
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,300
She had a very clear story.

193
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,087
She told me she hadn't thought about it very much until one 

194
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:11,060
distinct day in her high school calculus class, her teacher, Mr.

195
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,420
Dorman, pulled her aside and said, Talithia, you're really good at this.

196
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,740
You should consider majoring in math.

197
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,802
Evidently, she had never thought about it before, 

198
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:22,377
but that one comment was enough to knock over the first in 

199
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:25,520
a series of dominoes that led to a very flourishing career in the topic.

200
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,114
Over the years, I've asked a lot of mathematicians the same question, 

201
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:31,560
and you would be shocked how often I hear a very similar answer.

202
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,033
There was this one particular teacher, and one seemingly simple thing that they did, 

203
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,800
that was the beginning in a long series of encouragements.

204
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,936
Never underestimate just how much influence you can have on others, 

205
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,600
especially the ones who are younger than you are.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,429
Growing older is a process of slowly seeing the proportion of people 

207
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,740
around you who are younger than you are rise inexorably closer to 100%.

208
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,520
As this happens, you stand to have as much influence by shaping the 

209
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,320
dreams of those behind you as you do by following those of your own.

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,549
And as a very last point, the biggest risk in the follow your dreams 

211
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:14,800
clichÃ© is the implication that there's one static target point at all.

212
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,510
In the next 10, 20, 30 years, the world around you is going to change a lot, 

213
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,460
and those changes are going to be unpredictable.

214
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,280
I hardly need to emphasize this point.

215
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,169
You are the class who spent your formative transition 

216
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:31,460
from high school to college under a pandemic.

217
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,920
But it's not just the world around you.

218
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,542
Tonight, when you're celebrating your graduation and hopefully 

219
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,752
remembering to celebrate Mother's Day as well, 

220
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:43,561
take a few moments to ask the people who are older than you how they've changed, 

221
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,700
how their personalities, how their value systems have changed since they were a student.

222
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,453
You'll notice that essentially all of them has an answer, 

223
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:54,673
which suggests you have every reason to expect that there's going to be 

224
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,071
something fundamental about you that changes as well in the coming decades, 

225
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,100
probably unpredictably.

226
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,520
Almost everyone I know has undergone some kind of shift since college.

227
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,660
Some came to place more value on having a family than they used to.

228
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,764
Some shifted from a trajectory that was oriented 

229
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,280
towards an academic career to going into industry.

230
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,590
Some went the other way around and after spending 

231
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,200
some time in industry returned to grad school.

232
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,217
And so, so many of them have jobs that simply 

233
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,660
didn't exist at the time of their graduation.

234
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,688
So rather than having any one particular goal that defines who you are, 

235
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:32,055
you'll take better advantage of whatever the future has to offer you if you remain 

236
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:36,738
nimble and if you're responsive to the changes in the world and if you anticipate change 

237
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,580
within yourself.

238
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,480
My final piece of advice is to not treat passion as something to follow.

239
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,280
Think of it as an initial velocity vector.

240
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,364
It gives a clear direction to point yourself and 

241
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:50,480
loving what you do can have you move quickly.

242
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,984
But you should expect and you should even hope that the specific 

243
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:57,220
direction that you're moving changes based on the force vectors around you.

244
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,683
Now in these unpredictable decades that come, your generation is 

245
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:04,720
the one that holds more sway than any other over how it unfolds.

246
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,410
And you, the graduating class of Harvey Mudd, represent some 

247
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,540
of the most talented and thoughtful minds in that generation.

248
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,782
Influence is not distributed uniformly in the population and 

249
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:18,916
I for one would feel a lot more comfortable if it was you who 

250
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,100
were at the helm guiding this crazy ship that we're all riding.

251
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,466
If you step into the next chapter of life with an implacable focus on 

252
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,860
adding values to others, you're more likely to be the ones at the helm.

253
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,860
If you recognize that action precedes motivation, you're more likely to be at the helm.

254
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,637
And if you ask what's possible now that wasn't 10 years ago, 

255
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,420
you're more likely to be at the helm.

256
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,335
If you appreciate just how much power you have to shape the lives of 

257
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:47,740
the generation that follows you, you're more likely to be at the helm.

258
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,333
And if you remain adaptable to a changing world, 

259
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,181
treating passion not as a destination but as a fuel, 

260
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:58,320
following not dreams but opportunities, you're more likely to be at the helm.

261
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,454
One final time, would everyone please join me in congratulating the 

262
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:05,267
class of 2024 on what they've done to get here and make some noise 

263
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:08,080
to let them know how excited we are to see where they go from here.
