  "So that's going to turn into a circle.",
  492.76,

  "Exactly.",
  496.72,
  496.96

  497.18,
  498.48
 ],
 [
  "Yeah.",
  498.76,
  498.82
 ],
 [
  "So if we go to this point, the text gets written.",
  498.82,
  501.06
 ],
 [
  "What this line is going to do is say extract the H from that text.",
  501.86,
  506.98
 ],
 [
  "And then transform it into the circle.",
  507.44,
  509.82
 ],
 [
  "Oh, because the circle was in the middle it has moved it hasn't just put it away.",
  511.72,
  514.58

  "And so these these built in functions like write and transform that we're just seeing.",
  515.54,
  518.38

  523.12,
  523.68

  527.4

  "I enjoyed it.",
  533.72,

  545.12

  546.06

 [
  "So let's let's play with the transform.",
  546.24,
  549.4

  555.16
 ],
 [
  "I don't actually want that.",
  555.44,
  556.46

  587.28,
  587.72

  590.66

  "Yeah.",
  590.66,

  "Okay.",
  950.16,
  950.42

  970.58,
  973.66

  "If I knew how to spell self.",

  989.86

  991.04,
  995.26

  "No, because the thing is I was just adding the points, but I wasn't using the coordinate system of these axes in any way.",

  "And so.",
  1001.6,
  1001.96

  1005.42

 [
  "Right.",
  1005.64,
  1005.78

  1005.78,
  1017.08
 ],
 [
  "And there's an abbreviation for that because it's used a lot called chords to points.",

  1020.52
 ],
 [
  "And I'll just pass that in.",
  1021.08,
  1023.22

  "And I think actually it thinks of it in terms of you passing a list of X list of Y list of Z's.",
  1023.36,
  1028.46
 ],

  1032.48

 [
  "Can I check what that star is doing in that penultimate line on the code?",
  1035.96,
  1039.48

  "OK, so yeah, if you have let's say I have a tuple, this like one, two, three.",
  1040.32,
  1046.66
 ],
 [
  "Right.",
  1046.66,
  1047.0

  1057.48

 [
  "We'll do a non trivial.",
  1057.62,
  1058.38

  1061.66

  1061.66,
  1063.02

  "That's a different kind of error.",
  1064.5,
  1065.62
 ],
 [
  "It wants them separated.",
  1065.84,
  1066.64

 [
  "So in this case, points is an array where I like to think of each each row is one of the points.",

  1095.6

  "It's maybe a dumb design as I'm thinking about it right now.",
  1102.44,

 [
  "It makes sense.",

  "And it's like, here's that point.",

  "Yeah.",

  1130.12,

  1155.5

 [
  "Right.",
  1155.64,
  1155.76
 ],
 [
  "It'll draw it.",
  1156.04,
  1156.7
 ],
 [
  "But that was very fast.",
  1156.92,
  1157.86

  1263.06

  1321.8

  "So I'm just going to include that in the loop.",
  1335.76,
  1338.66

  1338.88,
  1341.08

  "In a moment, we can make it 10 if we want.",
  1374.16,
  1375.96

  1380.38

  "Those animations are this show creation thing.",
  1384.64,
  1386.72

  1387.62,
  1393.98

  "So there's a little bit baked into that.",
  1394.78,
  1396.92

  1412.92

  1413.84,
  1415.4

  1417.48

  1422.1

  1423.24,
  1425.66

  "Let's make that 30.",
  1426.16,
  1427.06

  1427.22,
  1430.62

  "Oh yes, so you can eyeball it easily.",
  1431.16,
  1432.6
 ],
 [
  "Yeah, so the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to make a group that'll have a thing called a glow dot color for colors.",
  1433.18,
  1445.38
 ],
 [
  "And again, glow dot is a baked in function that you've got because you want often to have a point that moves and has a nice bit of coloring into it.",
  1446.08,
  1452.02
 ],
 [
  "And so this one's not a vectorized thing.",
  1452.16,
  1454.22

  "So rather than it's just like its data is described by a point in space and like how much I want it to like ambiently glow.",
  1454.42,
  1460.18
 ],
 [
  "And it's got a little color.",
  1460.64,
  1461.46

  "And I'm going to create an updater function for it where I'm going to update the dots.",
  1461.82,
  1467.66
 ],
 [
  "This is going to be a function that takes those dots in.",
  1467.94,
  1470.24

  1470.62,
  1472.78

  "I often like to do that where it's like everything relevant to this animation we're doing just sits in that commenting bit.",
  1473.86,
  1479.02

  "I'm going to say for dot curve and zipping together the dots with the curves.",
  1480.5,
  1486.94
 ],
 [
  "I want each dot to move to the end point of the curve.",
  1487.28,
  1489.84
 ],
 [
  "So move to curve dot get end.",
  1490.5,
  1492.48

  "So curve dot get end will tell you its last point.",
  1493.52,
  1495.34
 ],
 [
  "The dots going to move to that point.",
  1496.18,
  1497.46

  1511.76

  1512.64

  "Yeah, yeah.",

  1544.56

  1544.7,
  1548.3

 [
  "Yeah.",
  1548.66,
  1548.68

  1557.1

  1559.54,

  1563.64,
  1565.74
