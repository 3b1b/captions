Here's a really nice puzzle. Suppose you randomly orient a cube in three-dimensional space,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,560
and you look at the area of its shadow.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,040
What's the expected value for that area?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,540
Or phrased another way, if you repeat this process over and over,

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,000
randomly tossing that cube and tallying up the areas that you find,

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,640
what would the empirically measured mean of all those measured areas approach as you do this more and more?

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,000
Strictly speaking, in referencing the shadow, that would depend on where the light source is,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,040
but here we're doing the typical mathematician thing of thinking of the light source as being infinitely far away,

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,660
so the shadow is just a flat projection, say, onto the xy-plane.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,920
It is definitely a hard problem, and I'm curious actually to hear how you would approach it in the comments.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,460
The longest video I've made to date explores this question.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,840
Really, it's a saga about two distinct problem-solving styles,

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,400
and why popularizations of math tend to have a bias in what kinds of styles they represent.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,440
The shadow puzzle just turns out to be a very perfect setting for that story.
