00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,813
The surface area of a sphere is 4Ï€ times its radius squared, 

2
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:07,440
exactly 4 times the area of a circle with the same radius.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,420
But why?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,270
Archimedes had a very beautiful proof that this surface area is the same as the area of 

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,720
a cylinder that encloses that sphere, if you disregard the circular caps of that cylinder.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,711
The idea is that if you shine some light from the z-axis perpendicular to that axis, 

7
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:27,311
then if you compare the area of a small rectangle drawn on that sphere to the area 

8
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:31,580
of the shadow cast on that cylinder, those two areas turn out to be the same.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,389
This isn't obvious, but when you work it out, that shadow is a copy of the original 

10
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:40,420
little rectangle, but squished down in one direction and stretched out in another.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,020
When you analyze the relevant geometry, the two effects actually cancel out perfectly.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,707
Treating the sphere as a sum of all of these little patches, 

13
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:51,171
and the cylinder as a sum of all of those shadows, 

14
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:55,520
we can infer that the surface area of the sphere is the same as the area of that cylinder.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,952
Now the cylinder is something you can unwrap into a rectangle, 

16
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:01,951
where one side length corresponds to the circumference, 2 pi r, 

17
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,420
and the other corresponds to the height of the sphere, 2 times its radius.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,380
This gives us the area we want, 4 pi r squared.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,367
And if you're also familiar with the trick of showing a circle's area, 

20
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:16,863
by unwrapping it into a triangle, one whose height is r and whose base is 2 pi times r, 

21
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:21,360
you can see how four of those unwrapped circles fit perfectly into this unwrapped shape.
