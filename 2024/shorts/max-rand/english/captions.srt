00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Matt Parker recently showed me this fact that seems completely wild.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,074
Say you sample two random numbers, each one uniform in the range from 0 to 1, 

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,780
and you compute their maximum.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,200
Then the result is of course another random number with this bias towards being larger.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,540
A seemingly completely different thing you could do would 

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,500
be to take one of those numbers and compute its square root.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,116
When you square a number that's smaller than 1, it becomes smaller, 

8
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:27,060
so that means when you take its square root, it becomes bigger.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,523
So this is another process that would give you 

10
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:32,040
a random value with a bias towards being larger.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,906
The surprise is that both of these are the same, 

12
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,711
in the sense that the distribution describing your result is identical for 

13
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:39,980
both of these procedures.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,445
At first it just feels really wrong that computing a maximum and 

15
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,869
a square root could give you the same thing like this, 

16
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,220
but there's actually a really nice way to visualize why this should be true.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,088
Well think about one of these random numbers as existing somewhere on an x-axis between 

18
00:00:55,088 --> 00:01:00,640
And the other random number is going to exist on a y-axis, again uniform between 0 and 1.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,463
So thinking of the pair of these numbers as a set of coordinates, 

20
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:08,923
when you sample both at random, you're basically sampling a random point inside this 

21
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:09,920
1 by 1 unit square.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,283
So take a moment to think about what it looks like for the 

23
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:18,040
maximum of these two values to be a particular number, like 0.7.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,621
Well either x1 is equal to that value and x2 is smaller than it, 

25
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:26,500
which puts you somewhere on this line, or x2 equals that value 

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,440
and x1 is smaller than that, putting you somewhere on this line.

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,291
In general, with continuous values, it's not very helpful to ask the probability 

28
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,960
of equaling a certain number, since the answer tends to be infinitesimal.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,396
But what is helpful is to ask the probability that your 

30
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:45,340
random value is less than or equal to a certain number.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,607
In this case, what it looks like to be less than or equal to 0.7 is that 

32
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:55,827
you fall somewhere inside this square here, and so because everything is uniform, 

33
00:01:55,827 --> 00:02:00,220
the probability of landing in that region is the area of that region.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,630
In general, the probability that this maximum 

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,480
is less than some number r looks like r-squared.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,109
This actually has a fancy name, it's called the 

37
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:11,780
cumulative distribution function for the random variable.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,180
But now, think about the other case, where you're taking a square root.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,905
What is the probability that the square root of 

40
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,320
one of these values is less than some number r?

41
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,310
That's the same thing as asking for the value itself to be less than or equal 

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,600
to r-squared, and since it's all uniform, the answer there is again r-squared.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,163
So both of these processes have the same cumulative distribution function, 

44
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:35,680
that's why they're identical.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,830
Essentially, identical reasoning will show that if you take the maximum of three 

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,640
such random variables, it has the same effect as taking the cube root of one of them.
