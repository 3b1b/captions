1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Has it ever bothered you how with exponents, logs, and roots, 

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,900
we have three completely different types of notation to write the same fact?

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,821
If you write 2 cubed equals 8, it's the relative 

4
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:12,900
position of the 3 over the 2 that indicates the operation.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,626
But when you write the cube root of 8 equals 2, 

6
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:18,920
which is the same fact, you introduce this new squiggly radical symbol.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,751
And then writing log base 2 of 8 equals 3, again the same fact, 

8
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,940
you write out a word for the operation.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,688
This weird discrepancy in notation isn't just counterintuitive, 

10
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:30,680
I think it's counter-mathematical.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,401
Rather than making seemingly different facts look the same, which is what math should do, 

12
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:39,480
it makes three facts that should obviously be the same look artificially different.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,114
I came across a really nice suggestion on math 

14
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:44,640
stack exchange for a more symmetric notation here.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,523
In our example, the way this would work is you write a triangle with 

16
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:52,080
a 2 in the lower left, a 3 on the top, and an 8 on the lower right.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,957
To express the operation 2 cubed, you remove that bottom right corner, 

18
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:00,600
and the symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in that missing corner.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,168
To express log base 2 of 8, which is asking the question 2 to the what equals 8, 

20
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,100
what you do is remove the top number.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,700
Again, the symbol as a whole represents the value that should go in that missing corner.

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,180
You can guess the third case.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,280
If you want to express the cube root of 8, you remove the lower left corner.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,781
Once again, the symbol as a whole represents the 

25
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,520
value that should go in the missing corner.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,420
This much more clearly expresses the relationship of all three operations.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,890
The definition alone is mildly pleasing, but where it becomes useful is in 

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,340
seeing how the rules for exponentiation logs and radicals are all really the same.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,261
The most extreme example might be how with our current notation, there are six, 

30
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:42,663
six distinct ways to express the various inverse operations, 

31
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,560
and it looks like a complete mess.

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,876
If you use the triangle of power, all of these 

33
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:51,020
operations follow the same basic aesthetic pattern.

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,040
Admittedly, it looks a little bit weird when your brain has already been trained with 

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,920
the traditional notation, but our brains are really good at picking up on patterns.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,012
And in this case, once you get used to it a little, 

37
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:05,780
you only need to remember one pattern which unlocks all six of these cases.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,275
Essentially, any rule that's associated with exponents logs and radicals 

39
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:13,620
becomes essentially three times faster to learn and to recognize.

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,183
If you have a pencil and paper, I highly encourage you to just take a 

41
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:20,400
moment and mess around with what some of these rules for exponents look like.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,472
It's weird at first when you're trained with the traditional notation, 

43
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:25,420
but it's super satisfying once it all clicks.
