00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Turning to chapter 2, advanced problems, problem number 10 asks this seemingly innocent question.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,780
Find the number of subsets of the set 1 up to 2000, the sum of whose elements is divisible

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,420
by 5.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,920
That might take a little moment to parse, but to illustrate let me show it on a much

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,920
simpler example, where we have the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,640
This has 2 to the 5th, or 32 distinct subsets, which look like this.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,600
If you compute the sum of each of those subsets, and you organize them by which ones have the

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,060
same sum, you'll see that 8 of those subsets have a sum which is divisible by 5.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,920
So the answer here would be 8.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,700
The case with all the subsets of 1 up to 2000 is obviously way, way bigger, and you might

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,680
be able to guess at a rough estimate for the answer, but the challenge is to compute the

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,500
exact answer.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,720
I really love this problem, and the full video I did on this question covers a really beautiful

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,320
and surprising way you can think about it.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,800
It uses one of those tools that mathematicians keep in their belt that legitimately feels

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,340
like magic the first time you see it.
