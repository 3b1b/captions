00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,479
I want to explain the image that you're looking at right now, 

2
00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:03,880
which is known as Newton's fractal.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,960
A little more accurately, it's an infinite family of fractals.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,878
And aside from being this beautiful, mesmerizing, infinitely detailed mess, 

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:14,700
what's really cool about the image is how it naturally pops out from something that 

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,660
any of you who've taken a calculus class might have heard of, known as Newton's method.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,850
A lot of math is about solving equations, and Newton's method is a really 

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,620
powerful tool for finding approximate solutions to essentially any equation.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,715
If you rearrange the equation so that it looks like setting some function 

10
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:34,810
of x equal to zero, then visually what it means to solve such an equation 

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,740
is to find a point where the graph of that function crosses the x-axis.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,780
Now the way that Newton's method works is to start by making an arbitrary guess.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,860
And of course the guess is almost certainly not a solution.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,512
But if you draw a tangent line to the graph at that guess, 

15
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:52,899
and you ask where does that tangent line intersect the x-axis, 

16
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,878
something much easier to solve explicitly, very often it takes you closer 

17
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:57,900
to a true solution.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,620
If you wash, rinse, and repeat doing this multiple different times, 

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,220
you often converge towards a solution especially quickly.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,640
If you do all the calculus and you work it out, 

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,360
there's a certain formula for how big your step size should be based on this process.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,849
And I won't go into the details, but just know that it is a 

23
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,970
formula and you can plug in one value, and what comes out is 

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,040
usually something closer to a true solution of the equation.

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,880
For our purposes, instead of considering a function with real number 

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,407
inputs and real number outputs like we're used to, 

27
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:30,720
consider all of the complex number inputs and the corresponding complex number outputs.

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,638
Now we can't visualize Newton's method with tangent lines and 

29
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:38,140
intersecting the x-axis anymore, but the formula still works.

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,276
It's still a valid rule that tells you how you can adjust 

31
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:44,380
one guess to push it closer to a true solution of the equation.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,601
Maybe that feels a bit bizarre, I realize not everyone 

33
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,420
loves complex numbers the way I do, but here's the cool part.

34
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,740
Watch what happens if we apply this idea to many many different possible initial guesses.

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,260
On each iteration, each of those dots is taking a step based on this Newton's method rule.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,431
With the example I'm showing, where our function is a degree 5 polynomial, 

37
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:09,440
there are five distinct solutions to the equation somewhere in the complex plane.

38
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,252
After many different iterations, most of our dots 

39
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,380
have zeroed in towards one of those solutions.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,856
What I'm going to do is color each one of those dots based on which of those five 

41
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:21,754
solutions it landed on, which one it ended up closest to, 

42
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:26,151
and then we'll kind of roll back the clock to see where each dot came from in the first 

43
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,200
place, giving us a certain color pattern.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,170
If you do this at a very fine resolution, treating each pixel of the 

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,740
screen as a possible initial guess, and going through the same game, 

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,310
coloring it based on which route that guess would end up landing on, 

47
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,880
the pattern that emerges is the image that I showed you at the start.

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,060
Isn't that wild?

49
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,377
On the full video, I talk much more about why you see a pattern like this, 

50
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,434
and what it implies about using Newton's method in practice, 

51
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:55,140
and how it connects to things like the Mandelbrot set.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,660
But for now, it's fun to just gawk at the beauty of math.
