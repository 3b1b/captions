Here's a really nice puzzle.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,304
Suppose you randomly orient a cube in three-dimensional space, 

3
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:07,560
and you look at the area of its shadow.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,040
What's the expected value for that area?

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,969
Or phrased another way, if you repeat this process over and over, 

6
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,338
randomly tossing that cube and tallying up the areas that you find, 

7
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:21,351
what would the empirically measured mean of all those measured areas approach as 

8
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,640
you do this more and more?

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,288
Strictly speaking, in referencing the shadow, that would depend on 

10
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:29,654
where the light source is, but here we're doing the typical mathematician 

11
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,748
thing of thinking of the light source as being infinitely far away, 

12
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:35,660
so the shadow is just a flat projection, say, onto the xy-plane.

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,670
It is definitely a hard problem, and I'm curious actually 

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,920
to hear how you would approach it in the comments.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,460
The longest video I've made to date explores this question.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,920
Really, it's a saga about two distinct problem-solving styles, 

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,661
and why popularizations of math tend to have a bias in what kinds of styles 

18
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,400
they represent.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,980
The shadow puzzle just turns out to be a very perfect setting for that story.
