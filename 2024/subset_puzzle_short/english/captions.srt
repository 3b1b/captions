00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,849
Turning to chapter 2, advanced problems, problem 

2
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,640
number 10 asks this seemingly innocent question.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,468
Find the number of subsets of the set 1 up to 2000, 

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,420
the sum of whose elements is divisible by 5.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,833
That might take a little moment to parse, but to illustrate let me 

6
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,920
show it on a much simpler example, where we have the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,640
This has 2 to the 5th, or 32 distinct subsets, which look like this.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,479
If you compute the sum of each of those subsets, 

9
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,374
and you organize them by which ones have the same sum, 

10
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:33,060
you'll see that 8 of those subsets have a sum which is divisible by 5.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,920
So the answer here would be 8.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,700
The case with all the subsets of 1 up to 2000 is obviously way, 

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,896
way bigger, and you might be able to guess at a rough estimate for the answer, 

14
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:45,500
but the challenge is to compute the exact answer.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,713
I really love this problem, and the full video I did on this question 

16
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:53,320
covers a really beautiful and surprising way you can think about it.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,217
It uses one of those tools that mathematicians keep in their 

18
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:59,180
belt that legitimately feels like magic the first time you see it.
