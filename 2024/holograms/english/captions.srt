1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Let me show you something I find completely magical.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,720
Behind this piece of glass, there appears to be a three-dimensional scene.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,119
You can move around your head and you see the 

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,060
light play off of the objects in different ways.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,300
For example, that glass Klein bottle in the front warps what's behind it.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,500
But it's an illusion.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,661
In reality, all that's there is an empty table 

8
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,360
and a diverging laser beam shining on the glass.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,030
Inside that glass is a single piece of film that's been exposed in 

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,060
a very special way that records the entire three-dimensional scene.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,959
It's hard to capture in a video how surreal this feels in person 

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,835
because despite there being nothing behind that glass, 

13
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:43,280
every visual cue available is screaming to your brain that something really is there.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,620
One of my favorite versions of this is a recording taken of a microscope.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,738
Again, it gives this illusion of a three-dimensional 

16
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:53,140
object stored on a two-dimensional piece of film.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,809
It's a little tricky to get this right, but if you put your eye at just the right 

18
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,400
point in space, you can look down the barrel of the microscope and see what it's imaging.

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,060
In this case, a little microchip.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,965
I want you to take a moment to reflect on just how incredible this is simply 

21
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:12,800
from the standpoint of how much information needs to be stored on that film.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,589
An ordinary photograph records a scene from just a single viewing angle, 

23
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:23,560
but right here we have available to us an entire continuum of differing perspectives.

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,542
In the first example, this includes how the light from the pie creature 

25
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:30,642
refracts through the glass in different ways from different angles, 

26
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:33,880
or how sometimes you get this little glint of light off the disco ball.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,984
Every optical detail from all these viewing angles 

28
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:40,680
is stored on that two-dimensional piece of film.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,660
What you're looking at is a hologram.

30
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,020
When most people hear the word hologram, what pops into their mind is something like 

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,722
what R2D2 projects in Star Wars, but real-world holograms are a special kind of recording 

32
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:03,320
taken on film that gives the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded scene.

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,580
The principle behind this was discovered by Dennis Gabor in 1947 while 

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,416
he was working on methods for electron microscopy, and as the story goes, 

35
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:15,200
the fundamental insight came to him while he was watching a tennis match.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,844
It wasn't until decades later, with the invention of lasers, 

37
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:23,684
that holography actually became practical, and in 1971 Gabor won the Nobel Prize 

38
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:24,760
for his discovery.

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,983
The type that I'm showing you here, where the scene is visible only 

40
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,380
when you illuminate it with a laser from behind, is the simplest version.

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,640
It's what's called a transmission hologram.

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,464
In this video, you and I will roll up our sleeves 

43
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:40,040
and dig into the details to understand how this works.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,540
A more advanced variant is what's called a white light reflection hologram, 

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,634
which as the name suggests can be illuminated using ordinary light that reflects 

46
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:49,140
off of it.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,302
This includes that microscope that I was showing you earlier, 

48
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:55,419
which is part of a collection from the Exploratorium in San Francisco, 

49
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,220
which they very generously let us record.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,732
First I want to show you the process for how you actually record a hologram, 

51
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:04,993
and then you and I will cover some of the fundamental principles of 

52
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:08,063
optics that explain one very simple and very specific hologram, 

53
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,660
but in such a way that we can get a deep and visceral understanding for it.

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,140
Then after that I'll share a slightly more abstract but much more 

55
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,120
powerful framing that explains how it works so well in general.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,684
Optics can be tricky and sometimes magical, so my goal at each of these steps is 

57
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:26,740
for this to really feel like something that you could have rediscovered for yourself.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,339
When my collaborator Paul and I asked around for help to record our own custom hologram, 

59
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,636
multiple people pointed us to these two very skilled holographers, 

60
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:42,277
Craig Newswanger and Sally Weber, who generously showed us the ropes when 

61
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,820
it comes to the delicate orchestration of lasers involved in doing this.

62
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,149
The whole setup risks feeling like a set of arbitrary steps, 

63
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:53,244
but I think maybe the best way to motivate it is to contrast what we're doing with 

64
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:54,280
ordinary photography.

65
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,094
In a photograph, a given point is only influenced by a very narrow 

66
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:01,380
region of the scene that you're recording, something like a pixel.

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,680
The simplest kind of camera would be a pinhole camera, 

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,899
where you only let light pass through a tiny little hole that exposes your film 

69
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:12,854
meaning each part of the film can only see one narrow little region of the 

70
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,120
scene through that hole.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,720
The point is that you're limiting things to a single viewing angle to influence the film.

72
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,320
All of the other information from all other possible viewing angles is lost.

73
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,337
The key thought to have in your mind when it comes to a hologram is 

74
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:32,000
that the goal is to recreate the entire light field around a scene.

75
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,306
What I mean by that is when you set up some scene and there's some light shining on it, 

76
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:40,978
there's this incredibly complicated undulating electromagnetic field that 

77
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,799
surrounds everything, and the specifics of that field are dependent on every 

78
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:48,620
optical property of the objects in your scene and the lights illuminating it.

79
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,860
What you see when you're an observer depends on where your eye is in that field.

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,578
In our test scene, for example, from some angles you see the pie creature's eye refracted 

81
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:02,714
through the glass of the Klein bottle, from others you see a glint of light off that 

82
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:07,092
disco ball, but in principle everything you can see from various different viewing angles 

83
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:11,228
is entirely a function of whatever this undulating light field is that surrounds the 

84
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:11,520
scene.

85
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,127
So if you could come up with a procedure that recreates the full state of that field, 

86
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:19,154
even when the objects are no longer there, it would give the 

87
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,140
complete illusion that we're aiming for.

88
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,935
Contrast this with the pinhole camera, where a ton of information 

89
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:29,260
is lost about that light field based on filtering through the hole.

90
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,120
After all, that hole is there to limit the exposure to just one viewing angle.

91
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,393
So the first thing you would do if you wanted to record the whole field is to get 

92
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:40,880
rid of that pinhole altogether, or the lens that simulates it with most cameras.

93
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,672
On its own, exposing the film would now create a non-sensically blurred mess, 

94
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:49,434
but the key to making it sensible is to account for another piece of 

95
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:52,760
information about light that normal photography loses, phase.

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,513
Think about a beam of light shining on a single point of film, 

97
00:05:56,513 --> 00:06:00,600
say one that has a pure frequency that you could think of as an oscillating sine wave.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,835
The height of this wave is called its amplitude, 

99
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:06,840
and how far you are along in the cycle is called the phase.

100
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,820
Only one of those determines how much the film gets exposed, the amplitude of the wave.

101
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,314
The exposure takes some time, and it's influenced 

102
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:16,620
by the average intensity of this wave over that time.

103
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,262
Actually, more specifically, the exposure is proportional 

104
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:22,480
to the square of the amplitude of this wave.

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,480
That's going to be important for us much later.

106
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,295
If you were to shift this wave back by half of its wavelength, 

107
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:30,751
it makes no difference to the exposure on the film, 

108
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:34,246
in a sense that point of the film completely forgets everything about the 

109
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,900
phase of the light that exposed it.

110
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,864
You could almost reinvent holography for yourself if you ask, 

111
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:44,340
how might it be possible to record the phase of the light, not just the amplitude?

112
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,127
Can you come up with a procedure where one beam of light would expose the 

113
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:52,937
film differently than another beam that is in all respects identical, 

114
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:57,020
except for the fact that its phase is shifted back, say by half of a cycle?

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,713
If you give yourself a moment, and if you're rather clever, 

116
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,400
you might think of something like this.

117
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,860
Shine on a second beam of light that has exactly the same frequency.

118
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
We're going to call this the reference wave.

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,438
When the first beam is in sync with that reference wave, 

120
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:17,113
the two will constructively interfere, producing a wave that has twice the amplitude, 

121
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,560
so the film gets exposed a lot at that point.

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,159
But if that first beam was shifted back half of a cycle, 

123
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,053
the two would now cancel out with each other, interfering destructively, 

124
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,880
so the film would be exposed much less at that point.

125
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,632
It's not a perfect recording of the phase, but in this case the exposure is highly 

126
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:38,860
sensitive to phase shifts in a way that's not at all true for normal photography.

127
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,585
Admittedly, it might not yet be clear why this has anything to do with storing 

128
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:48,702
a three-dimensional scene on a two-dimensional film, but at least in principle, 

129
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,820
if you know that the goal is to recreate the full state of a light field around 

130
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,091
your scene, perhaps you could believe that having a record of the phase variations 

131
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,900
in that light field along the plane of the film might somehow be relevant.

132
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,430
This insight of interfering with a reference beam 

133
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,400
only works if all the light has the same frequency.

134
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,140
So looking at your setup, you cannot illuminate the scene with ordinary white light.

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
What you have to do is use a laser.

136
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,907
A clever way to do this is to pass that laser through a beam splitter, 

137
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:22,760
where half of it gets spread out, bounces off the scene, and hits the film.

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,780
We'll call that the object wave.

139
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,705
And then the other half also gets spread out, but it 

140
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:30,140
doesn't interact with anything before hitting the film.

141
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,240
This will act as the reference wave.

142
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,931
Those two waves interfere at the plane of the film in a 

143
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,299
way that depends heavily on the phase of that object wave.

144
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,396
The full setup that Craig and Sally made for us 

145
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,540
looks only a little bit more complicated than this.

146
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,010
One little nuance is that beam splitters change the polarization of light, 

147
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,960
so you have to do something to counteract that.

148
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,335
The object beam follows this trajectory here, which lets our scene 

149
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:56,320
get right up next to the film and get illuminated from the front.

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,680
And then on the left we have the reference beam.

151
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,499
But at a high level, the essence of any holography setup is to 

152
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,560
have these two different sources of light, both of the same single frequency, 

153
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,320
interfering with each other at the plane of the film.

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,643
This means that the exposure pattern on the film is based on the 

155
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:18,980
extremely subtle ways that these two waves interfere with each other.

156
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,440
The exposure pattern looks absolutely nothing like the original objects.

157
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,888
If you zoomed in with a microscope, you would see a complete mess, 

158
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:30,340
some rapidly oscillating fringes between points of high and low exposure.

159
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,838
From a practical standpoint, you should note how this also 

160
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:38,955
means the exposure pattern is incredibly sensitive to even the 

161
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:42,220
tiniest movement of the objects in the scene during the recording.

162
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,217
If their position shifts by an amount comparable to the wavelength of the light, 

163
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:50,660
a few hundred nanometers, it can completely change that pattern.

164
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,871
So when Craig and Sally were showing us the ropes, 

165
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:57,375
one thing that really surprised me was how part of the process involved all 

166
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,510
of us sitting in this meditative stillness throughout the exposure, 

167
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,940
which took a couple of minutes.

168
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,433
We even had to sit still during the minutes leading up to it, 

169
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:08,340
reducing as much motion as possible in the air of the room.

170
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,170
Now at this point, even if you believe that this resulting interference pattern 

171
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,617
on the film somehow records information about the light and its phase and all of that, 

172
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,554
it's not at all obvious how you could use it to recreate the original field, 

173
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,440
making that illusion of the scene behind the glass visible from many angles.

174
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,120
But here, my friend, is the magic.

175
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,228
If you now remove all the objects from the scene and you block that object beam, 

176
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:37,457
so the only thing shining on this now exposed film is the reference beam, 

177
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:42,314
then what it produces beyond the glass includes a complete recreation of that object 

178
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:47,228
wave, a recreation of light that would be there if the scene were still there and the 

179
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:49,000
object beam were still shining.

180
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,813
This is the surprise of holography, the mystery that you 

181
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:55,560
and I are going to dig into for the remainder of the video.

182
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,448
Why is it that shining the reference wave through this film, 

183
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:03,209
which was exposed using the combined object and reference waves, 

184
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,680
gives you such a bizarrely perfect recreation of the object?

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,465
How does this delicate and apparently nonsensical interference 

186
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:15,480
pattern on the film somehow record an entire three-dimensional scene?

187
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,894
To drive home how magical this feels, we cut out 

188
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:21,220
a very small circle from the film that we recorded.

189
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,706
In an ordinary photograph, cutting out a small piece obviously cuts away the 

190
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:29,963
vast majority of the scene, but for a hologram holding up that same small little 

191
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:34,219
circle of film to the reference beam, as you shift your viewing position looking 

192
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:38,371
through that circle, you can see essentially every part of the scene recorded, 

193
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:42,260
from that pie creature to the disco ball and the various shapes behind it.

194
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,100
You just can't see all of them at once.

195
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,988
Continuing with the goal of rediscovery, universal problem solving tip number one is 

196
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:55,820
to begin analyzing any hard problem by taking the simplest version of that problem.

197
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,921
So to puzzle over how holography works, a natural place you might start is to ask, 

198
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:05,099
what happens if you record a hologram of the simplest object you could think of, 

199
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,040
maybe a little point floating in three-dimensional space?

200
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,604
We'll think of the light that reflects as a wave 

201
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:14,300
propagating radially away from that point.

202
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,011
The basic outline for what follows is that we'll figure out what the exposure pattern 

203
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:24,454
on the film is in this very simple case, then deduce why shining the reference through 

204
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:28,794
that known exposure pattern creates the illusion of a single point behind the glass, 

205
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:32,880
even when it's not there, and then we'll generalize to more complicated objects.

206
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,752
I should maybe take a moment to be clear on how 

207
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm representing light waves throughout this video.

208
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,292
Light is a wave in the electromagnetic field, where for example 

209
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,750
the electric half of that is an association between each point in 

210
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,260
space and a little oscillating vector pointing in three dimensions.

211
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,126
Where that field is strong in one direction, I'll color a point blue, 

212
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:56,826
and when it's strong in the opposite direction, I'll color it red, 

213
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,920
and the dark bands in between represent where it's zero.

214
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,164
In principle, the field exists everywhere in three-dimensional space, 

215
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:08,082
but typically it's a lot easier to think about if I only color the points along a 

216
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:09,420
two-dimensional slice of it.

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,317
Even more narrowly, it's often helpful to think of a little sine 

218
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:16,327
wave over this when we want to think of what the wave-like 

219
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:19,900
variations are just along a single one-dimensional line through space.

220
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,776
And for the detail oriented among you, throughout this video we'll be 

221
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,989
assuming that the light is linearly polarized, 

222
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:29,427
meaning it just oscillates in one direction, which it typically would be 

223
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:30,840
if we're recording a hologram.

224
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,497
Now, when we take a hologram of this single point, 

225
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:39,509
the radial wave coming from that point is our object wave, and for the reference wave, 

226
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,174
again in the spirit of simplicity, I want you to think of it as coming from very 

227
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:48,322
very far away, enough so that we can model it as a plane wave coming in 

228
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:49,820
perpendicular to the film.

229
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,347
In other words, what I mean by that is that all of the wave 

230
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:56,280
crests from that reference beam are parallel to the film.

231
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,704
You should know that in practice for real holography, 

232
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,398
you want this reference beam to come in at an angle, 

233
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:06,922
later on you're going to understand why, but for right now, keeping the analysis simple, 

234
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:10,480
making that beam perpendicular gives us a friendly situation to study.

235
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,430
I can simulate for you what the combination of both of these waves looks like, 

236
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,532
and what the resulting exposure pattern on the film looks like, 

237
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:20,860
but it is helpful to think through for yourself.

238
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,582
For example, if the light off of that object hitting the 

239
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:28,403
nearest point of the film happens to be in phase with the reference beam, 

240
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:31,140
it means that center point would be strongly exposed.

241
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,929
In that case, for points farther away from the center, 

242
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,782
because the distance to the object gets longer, 

243
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:42,061
the phase of the object wave along this strip falls in and out of phase 

244
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:46,222
with the reference wave, meaning that the exposure pattern oscillates 

245
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,600
between points of high and low exposure.

246
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,607
For example, at a certain point on that film, the distance to the 

247
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:56,253
object will be exactly half of a wavelength longer than the distance 

248
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:59,900
between the object and the closest point on the film, at that center.

249
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,164
So if the object and reference beams had been in phase in the middle, 

250
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:07,053
it would mean that they're exactly out of phase here, 

251
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:11,440
so the combined wave has a low amplitude and you get this dark spot at that point.

252
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,855
The same would be true for everything along this ring around the center, 

253
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:18,260
of all points the same distance to the object.

254
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,360
In general, the exposure pattern here looks like a bunch of concentric rings.

255
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,355
If you enjoy exercises, you might like taking a moment to try writing an explicit 

256
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:31,485
formula for the radii of all of those rings, as a function of the distance 

257
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:35,780
between the object point and the film, as well as the wavelength of the light.

258
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,676
At a more qualitative level though, just note that the distance between 

259
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:42,900
these fringes gets smaller as you go farther away from the middle.

260
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,110
This pattern is important enough in optics that it has its own special name, 

261
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,640
it's called a Fresnel zone plate.

262
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,870
The wavelength of visible light is really small, 

263
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,220
and that means that the fringes of exposed points are spaced very close together.

264
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,660
Farther away from the middle point, they approach the wavelength of the light itself.

265
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,814
In the simulation, notice how if I bring the object point closer, 

266
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:08,921
the inner rings get smaller, and if I pull that object point farther away, 

267
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:10,400
the inner rings get bigger.

268
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,040
So in a manner, this pattern records the three-dimensional coordinates of our point.

269
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,139
The center of the rings give you the xy coordinates, 

270
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,940
and the ring spacing uniquely determines the z coordinate.

271
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,377
So you go ahead and you record this simplest of all holograms, 

272
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:31,380
and you end up with film that has this peculiar zone plate exposure pattern.

273
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,820
But how does reconstruction work in this case?

274
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,566
What happens when you remove the object and the object beam, 

275
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:41,420
and the only thing shining on the exposed film is the reference wave?

276
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,109
Well, if you look at just a small region of the film, 

277
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:48,223
the zone plate pattern looks like a bunch of parallel stripes, 

278
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:51,684
and this is related to a very well-studied phenomenon in optics known 

279
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:52,920
as a diffraction grating.

280
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,282
And while I could just plop down something known as the 

281
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,349
diffraction equation right now to continue with the explanation, 

282
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,180
it is a real joy to see how it arises from first principles.

283
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,427
So continuing that theme of letting this feel like something 

284
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:08,241
that you might have rediscovered, let's take a brief sidestep 

285
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,099
into a mini-lesson so that I don't have to rob you of that joy.

286
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,619
Here's the basic puzzle for this mini-lesson.

287
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,918
You've got a light wave shining onto a wall, and imagine this wall is solid and opaque, 

288
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:25,425
except for having a bunch of very thin evenly spaced slits that the light can pass 

289
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:25,859
through.

290
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,000
The basic question is, what does the light wave look like on the other side of this wall?

291
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,400
And in particular, how does it depend on the distance between those slits?

292
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,643
Now, a full answer is extremely complicated, so much so that 

293
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:43,100
it's surprising that we'll be able to say anything useful at all.

294
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,641
And before I spoil the general shape of the answer with the simulation here, 

295
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,940
let me be clear about how we're going to think about it.

296
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,667
For each individual one of those slits, we'll imagine that it's 

297
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,190
thin enough that you can model it as a single point emanating light, 

298
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,560
matching whatever wavelength and frequency the incoming light has.

299
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,782
So if there was some wall or film behind this single slit, 

300
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,220
you wouldn't really see anything all that interesting.

301
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,747
It would be brightest in the middle, and then taper off very gently to the side, 

302
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:13,400
depending on how the amplitude of that wave diminishes over distance.

303
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,916
In particular, nothing here really gives you a hint about the phase of the light, 

304
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,440
so the wave nature remains relatively under-spoken.

305
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,000
Very famously, this changes when you open up a second slit.

306
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,010
In fact, when Thomas Young did this for monochromatic light in 1801, 

307
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,600
it was one of the earliest confirmations that light really is a wave.

308
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,900
For you and me, thinking about two slits is a nice warm-up before we get to more.

309
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,796
As an example, think about the point at the center 

310
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,060
of that wall on the opposite side of the slits.

311
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,274
In that case, the waves coming from each one would be in phase with each other, 

312
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,660
so they interfere constructively, and that's why you get a bright spot.

313
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,680
If you move over a little bit to the side, where the distance to one 

314
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,382
slit is exactly half a wavelength longer than the distance to the other, 

315
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,680
they would add destructively, and that's why you get a dark spot.

316
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,997
And in general, you get these oscillations between 

317
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,120
bright and dark as you scan left to right.

318
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,295
The key point here, which you have to imagine was a bit of a surprise in 1801, 

319
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:15,734
is that the brightness on the wall is not just a sum of what it would be for each 

320
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:16,600
individual slit.

321
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,214
The key, when you have light just of one frequency like this, 

322
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:24,000
is to understand where the waves are in and out of phase with each other.

323
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,132
Also, I want you to notice how the pattern changes 

324
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,120
if we change the wavelength of the light.

325
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,560
A shorter wavelength would give more rapid oscillations between bright and dark spots.

326
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,892
There's a really nice exhibit at the Exploratorium in 

327
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,120
San Francisco showing this double slit interference.

328
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,522
You shine a thin laser beam through two even thinner slits, and on a wall very far down, 

329
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:50,560
what you see is an array of light and dark spots, just like what we saw in the simulation.

330
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,825
That's just two slits, but remember that our key question is what happens when 

331
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:59,820
you have a whole bunch of slits, say spaced a distance d away from each other.

332
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,835
I have to say this was incredibly fun to simulate, 

333
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,820
and you can probably guess how the simulation here is working.

334
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,686
At every point in space, you consider the n different light waves coming from each 

335
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:13,835
one of those slits, you add up the values of those waves, 

336
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:16,767
which might add or subtract depending on their phase, 

337
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,700
and then you color that point depending on the result.

338
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,420
Blue for positive values, red for negative values.

339
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,486
In the immediate vicinity of the slits, this is a complete chaotic mess, 

340
00:20:27,486 --> 00:20:31,020
but the surprise is that when you zoom out, order emerges.

341
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,253
You have one beam of light shining down the middle, 

342
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:42,686
but you also get these other beams shining off on either side, 

343
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:46,664
and one of those beams specifically is going to be the key to explaining 

344
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:47,700
our first hologram.

345
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,083
In particular, I want you to understand how you'd 

346
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,120
compute the angle between that other beam and the center.

347
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,448
How would you analyze a point which is along a 

348
00:20:57,448 --> 00:21:00,280
line some angle theta away from that perpendicular?

349
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,133
Well, the key question is what are the distances from that point 

350
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:08,600
to all of the individual slits where the light is coming from?

351
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,029
If this point is far enough away, then when you zoom in close to those slits, 

352
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:16,160
all of those lines look like they're parallel to each other.

353
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,719
What you want to know is whether a given one of these lines is longer than 

354
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:24,600
another one of the lines, and more specifically, how much longer it would be.

355
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,349
I think one of the nicest ways to think about this is to zoom out again so that 

356
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,297
we can see the point we're analyzing, and imagine pivoting one of those lines 

357
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:37,600
around that point so you're looking at everywhere else that's the same distance away.

358
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,545
If you were zoomed in next to the slits, that pivoting motion 

359
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:45,380
looks basically like you're translating in a perpendicular direction.

360
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,903
So what that means is if you drop a little perpendicular line from one of the slits to 

361
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:57,227
the line adjacent to it, you can conclude that the distance between that first slit and 

362
00:21:57,227 --> 00:22:02,309
the point we're analyzing is exactly the same as this section of the adjacent line, 

363
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,754
meaning that the difference between those two distances is visible as this little snippet 

364
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:08,420
right here.

365
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,115
So the key question, if you want to understand whether those two waves 

366
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:15,320
are in or out of phase with each other, is how big is that snippet?

367
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,860
What's the size of that difference?

368
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,271
Well if you go in and you draw the appropriate little right triangle, 

369
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:24,544
the hypotenuse of that triangle is the spacing between the slits, 

370
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:28,461
which I'm going to call d, so this key difference we care about looks like one 

371
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:32,329
of the legs of that triangle, d times the sine of a certain little angle that 

372
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,520
I'm going to call theta.

373
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,870
It's not too hard to convince yourself that that angle theta is actually 

374
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,070
the same as the angle between all these lines and the vertical, 

375
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,470
so the difference between all of these lengths, 

376
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,419
and this is really the key lesson of diffraction gradings, 

377
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,520
looks like d times the sine of that angle.

378
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,767
In particular, if it was the case that this key expression, d times the sine of theta, 

379
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:57,951
happened to be exactly the wavelength of the light, commonly denoted lambda, 

380
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:02,244
all of the beams emanating from these different slits are going to be in phase 

381
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:06,700
with each other, so they'll constructively interfere at the point we're analyzing.

382
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,502
This is why, even in the immediate vicinity, you have this chaotic mess that's very hard 

383
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:15,448
to describe, zoomed out a sufficient distance away, 

384
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:19,187
you have a distinct beam along a certain direction, and moreover, 

385
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:22,360
you now know how to compute the angle of that direction.

386
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,031
It's the angle such that d, the spacing between your slits, 

387
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:29,500
times the sine of that angle equals the wavelength of the light.

388
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,903
That will be a key equation for us, so do remember it, 

389
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:37,436
but this graphic also helps give a nice qualitative intuition for how changing the 

390
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:39,020
spacing influences the angle.

391
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,752
Imagine locking the length of this critical leg of the triangle, 

392
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:44,680
you want it to always equal the wavelength.

393
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,318
Then if you want it to narrow the spacing of the grating, making d smaller, 

394
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:53,260
the only way to keep that leg locked is to make the angle theta bigger.

395
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,166
On the other hand, if you had a wider spacing and you increased that value d, 

396
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,960
the only way to keep that leg locked is to decrease the value of theta.

397
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,280
You can also say a little bit more here too.

398
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,072
For large enough values of d, it's possible for d times the sine of 

399
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:12,170
theta to not just be a single wavelength, but to equal two whole wavelengths, 

400
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,952
so you would still get constructive interference but at a bigger angle, 

401
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:19,420
and the same goes for any whole number multiple of the wavelength.

402
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,840
And again, this is something that you can see in practice.

403
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,273
Here we're shining a green laser through a diffraction 

404
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,560
grating that has 500 lines per millimeter.

405
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,173
You can not only see how it splits up into these distinct beams, 

406
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:36,080
but you could actually do the math to figure out the angle between those beams.

407
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,216
The centermost one is commonly called the zeroth order beam, 

408
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:43,393
the ones immediately next to it are called the first order beams, 

409
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:47,340
and if they exist, the other ones are called second order, third order, and so on.

410
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,480
Another fun thing to notice is how this equation depends on the wavelength of the light.

411
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,303
So if you shine white light through a diffraction grating like this, 

412
00:24:56,303 --> 00:25:00,360
you get a separation into distinct wavelengths, distinct colors like a rainbow.

413
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,521
If you've ever noticed how the reflections off of a DVD or a CD produce 

414
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:08,120
this rainbow pattern, it's essentially the same effect going on there.

415
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,729
The angle of reflection depends on the spacing 

416
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:13,300
between the ridges and the wavelength of the light.

417
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,346
So that's the packaged lesson about diffraction gratings, 

418
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:21,100
but now let's zoom out and remember why we were doing this.

419
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,427
If you record a hologram of a simple point in space, 

420
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:28,257
the exposure pattern on the film is this Fresnel zone plate, 

421
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:32,840
concentric rings that get spaced closer together the farther you go away.

422
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,319
In fact, you can be a little bit more quantitative 

423
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,080
and write down the exact spacing between those fringes.

424
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,536
Let's say you draw a line from a point on this film down to the object, 

425
00:25:43,536 --> 00:25:47,160
or maybe I should say down to where the object was during recording.

426
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,736
Consider the angle between this line and the one perpendicular to the film, 

427
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:54,621
which I'm going to call theta prime to distinguish it from 

428
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,920
the diffraction angles we were just looking at.

429
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,262
I won't narrate through all the details here, 

430
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:01,460
but you can work out this fringe spacing exactly.

431
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,143
You start with the premise that the distance between adjacent 

432
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:08,360
fringes to the object should differ by one whole wavelength.

433
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,808
I know some of you are curious and want to pause and ponder, 

434
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:16,197
so I'll leave up the details, but the upshot is that it all boils down to a delightfully 

435
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,480
clean and convenient fact.

436
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,530
The spacing between the fringes for our Fresnel zone plate, which I'll label as D, 

437
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,640
multiplied by the sine of this angle, theta prime, equals the wavelength of the light.

438
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,944
This might give you a little déjà vu, and if it strikes you as uncannily similar to the 

439
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:37,900
diffraction equation, you are 100% right and it's the key to how our first hologram works.

440
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,243
When you just shine the reference wave through this pattern, 

441
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:46,261
near a given point on the film, it acts like a diffraction grating, 

442
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:50,337
splitting the wave into distinct beams, and the angle of those first 

443
00:26:50,337 --> 00:26:55,300
order beams satisfies the diffraction equation, D times sine of theta equals lambda.

444
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,272
Therefore, the angle of one of these first order beams exactly matches 

445
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:04,230
the angle of the line connecting this point of the film to where the 

446
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,360
object was during recording, even though the object isn't there anymore.

447
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,697
So, critically, think about why this would imply 

448
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,960
there's the illusion of a point behind the screen.

449
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,345
For an observer on the other side of that film, as the reference wave is shining onto it, 

450
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:28,339
every point of that film is emitting multiple different beams, 

451
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,586
but one of those beams at each point matches what a beam from that 

452
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:36,580
object dot would look like if that object dot were still there.

453
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,557
So the observer always sees this bright spot on the glass at a point where 

454
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:46,080
a line from their eye to the past object position intersects the glass.

455
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,135
As they move their head around, and their eye moves in 3D space, 

456
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:54,309
that apparent bright spot on the glass moves with them in just such a 

457
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,960
way that it gives the illusion of a floating point of light behind that glass.

458
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,152
The way things are set up right now, the other 

459
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:06,640
beams would add some distraction for that observer.

460
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,340
The zeroth order beam, for example, at all of these points is essentially a rescaled 

461
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,820
version of what the reference wave would look like if the film weren't there.

462
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,320
To the observer, this looks like a bright glow coming from everywhere behind the film.

463
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,044
This would be pretty obnoxious, but it can be 

464
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:24,400
solved by shining the reference beam in at an angle.

465
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,640
You might be curious about the other first order beam, and it's actually very interesting.

466
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,028
If you draw a line along that other first order beam from every point at the film, 

467
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:38,720
all of those lines converge at a single point on the opposite side of the film.

468
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,375
This is our first peek at a funny little artifact 

469
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,780
of holography known as the conjugate image.

470
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,696
Much earlier I said that the way you want to think about a hologram is that you're 

471
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:53,720
trying to record and reconstruct the state of the light field around a scene.

472
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,160
The truth is that a hologram doesn't exactly do this.

473
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,540
What it actually recreates can be thought of as a sum of three different light waves.

474
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,756
One of them is a scaled copy of the reference wave, 

475
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:08,600
which for our simple point example corresponds to the zeroth order beam.

476
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,700
Another corresponds to a copy of the wave emanating from the object.

477
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,633
This is exactly the thing we want to reconstruct, 

478
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:19,484
and in our simple example it corresponds to one of these first order beams, 

479
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:21,460
but there's also a third wave in there.

480
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,591
In this simple example of a hologram of a single point, 

481
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:27,656
that third component looks like the reference beam being 

482
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:31,420
concentrated in to a single reflection of that point through the film.

483
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,823
More generally though, this third component looks like the reference beam being 

484
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:40,360
refocused onto a reflected version of your full object on the opposite side of the film.

485
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,757
In the hologram that we recorded with Craig and Sally, 

486
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:47,288
you can actually see this by putting a piece of paper behind the glass, 

487
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:51,457
where at the appropriate distance away, you see the light focused onto the shape of, 

488
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,940
for example, the pie creature, which was part of the scene we recorded.

489
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,460
This is known as the conjugate image.

490
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,883
In the earliest days of holography, Dennis Gabor had a lot of 

491
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,194
trouble seeing the holograms that he wanted to, 

492
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:06,900
because this conjugate image kept getting in the way, muddying up the waters.

493
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,895
However, again this is something where if you use a reference beam 

494
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:14,544
that shines on the film at an angle, you can get a clean separation 

495
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:18,140
of the reconstructed object wave from this conjugate wave artifact.

496
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,140
The astute among you might ask about the higher order beams from a diffraction grating.

497
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,192
After all, we saw how the equation doesn't just imply three beams for large enough 

498
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:33,480
values of d, you can have many more angles that satisfy the diffraction equation.

499
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,391
This is something I actually didn't know until learning about holography, 

500
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:43,216
but if instead of a binary grating, where light either completely passes through or gets 

501
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:48,041
completely blocked, you instead have a material that only partially allows light through 

502
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,752
with an opacity that follows a sine wave pattern, 

503
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:53,300
then you actually don't get higher order beams.

504
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,280
The diffraction pattern only includes zeroth and first order beams.

505
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,208
The most elegant way to show why, in my opinion, 

506
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:04,630
comes from the more formal explanation of holograms that I want to show you in a few 

507
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,103
minutes, but for right now just know that you're safe to only think about three beams 

508
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:11,080
emanating from each point of the film.

509
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,172
So, stepping back, you, the problem solver puzzling over holography, 

510
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:18,680
have at least this one example to hold onto.

511
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,954
A hologram of a single point gives a zone plate, 

512
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:26,976
and the diffraction effect of shining the reference through the zone plate includes, 

513
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,580
among other things, a recreation of the wave from that point.

514
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,160
A natural place your mind might go from here is to wonder about two such points in space.

515
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,880
Right here is a simulation for what the resulting exposure pattern would look like.

516
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,710
It's based on adding the two radial waves from those points together with a reference 

517
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,550
wave, and you can clearly tell that it's related to the zone plate associated with each 

518
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,465
one, effectively encoding two distinct 3D positions, 

519
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:57,590
but it is more complicated than simply adding the two individual patterns, 

520
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,485
in the same way that the double slit interference is more complicated than simply adding 

521
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,740
the brightness from each individual slit.

522
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,180
The result depends on how the waves and their phases interfere.

523
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,691
Even still, you can see how this might lead you to think about building up a scene 

524
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:19,243
as a combination of multiple points, and hypothesizing that the resulting exposure 

525
00:32:19,243 --> 00:32:23,960
pattern can be thought of as some kind of combination of the zone plates for each one.

526
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,494
The simulation I'm showing you has only 30 points, 

527
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:31,520
and already the result effectively looks like random noise.

528
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,563
But nevertheless, I think you would agree that a reasonable hypothesis would 

529
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:40,306
be that the diffraction effect of shining a reference beam through this 

530
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:44,413
pattern might be the sum of what you would get from the zone plates associated 

531
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:48,416
with each individual point, and you know that looking through from the other 

532
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:52,420
side of this film, it would give the illusion of those 30 points being there.

533
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,569
If that were true, you could think of a more complicated object or more 

534
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:01,130
complicated scene as a continuous cloud of many little points, 

535
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,652
and the resulting pattern would not only encode the 3D position and orientation 

536
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:10,740
of that object, but it would also enable the simple reconstruction that we're looking for.

537
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,679
As stated so far, this is all sketchy and non-rigorous, 

538
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,996
but it does actually lead you to some very real intuition about how holography 

539
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:20,980
works in practice.

540
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,743
Think back to the very start, when I asked you to appreciate 

541
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:27,304
how much information is being stored on this film, 

542
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:30,920
in that it can recreate a scene from a wide continuum of viewing angles.

543
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,202
Part of the catch is that for this process to work, 

544
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:36,700
the film has to have extremely high resolution.

545
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,322
For comparison, standard Polaroid Instant Film 

546
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:43,140
resolves only around 10 lines per millimeter.

547
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,096
Microfilm will get you somewhere a little over 100 lines per millimeter, 

548
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:53,157
but the film that we used to record this hologram can resolve many thousands of lines 

549
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,040
per millimeter.

550
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,260
And now you know why this is necessary.

551
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,476
The spacing between fringes in a zone plate becomes very very narrow, 

552
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:07,656
and faithfully recording those variations is necessary to reconstruct the object beam 

553
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:08,500
at that point.

554
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,416
Without the outer fringes, the effect for a viewer would be that they 

555
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,600
simply don't see the object if they're viewing from a sharp angle.

556
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,048
This is not a complete explanation without justifying how exactly the 

557
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:25,010
exposure pattern that you get from multiple points would have a diffraction 

558
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,920
effect that equals the sum of what you would get for the individual points.

559
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,620
Even then, there's a deeper issue.

560
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,601
Building up a scene from individual points would 

561
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:37,020
not do true justice to the power of holography.

562
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,139
The reason we included that glass Klein bottle in our example is to emphasize this power.

563
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:46,699
That glass does not act as a collection of points, merely reflecting light.

564
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,602
It affects the surrounding optics of the scene, 

565
00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:54,080
like how the light from the objects behind gets bent and distorted as it passes through.

566
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,245
The hologram perfectly recreates this effect in a way 

567
00:34:57,245 --> 00:35:00,180
that could not be explained by adding up individual points.

568
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,600
Anyone who has experience with ray tracing will appreciate the difference here.

569
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,213
Also, the sharp-eyed viewers among you might have noticed 

570
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:10,940
a couple gaps in the explanation even for a single point.

571
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,763
For example, I mentioned shining in the reference beam at an angle, 

572
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,216
but that would also change the exposure pattern, 

573
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,920
so it's not entirely clear that the logic still works.

574
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,688
Sometimes in math, a complex problem can be solved incrementally by building 

575
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:30,236
up simple cases, but other times the simple cases act more like training exercises, 

576
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:34,351
and the best way to tackle a general situation is to set up a new framework 

577
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:38,520
for thinking about it, such that the general solution simply falls right out.

578
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,155
In the case of studying holography, there is an entirely different and 

579
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:47,120
more powerful way to explain holograms that subsumes all of these issues.

580
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,495
I'll walk through it at the very end here as a kind of technical 

581
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:53,612
appendix to the whole video, but I think it would be nice to wrap up 

582
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:57,000
the main discussion by stepping back and discussing holograms more broadly.

583
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,661
Everything we just described covers a transmission hologram, 

584
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:05,720
the simplest variety, and these have been possible ever since the late 60s.

585
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,459
More advanced techniques exist where the film can reproduce the scene not using a laser, 

586
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,980
but with ordinary white light reflecting off of it.

587
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,680
And it goes beyond that.

588
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,575
There are techniques where you can make changes in the scene over time 

589
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:21,443
visible as you view the hologram from different angles, 

590
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:25,540
or where you can take a 3D computer graphics model and produce a hologram of it.

591
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,660
You and I covered the bicycle, but people went on to cars and planes thereafter.

592
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,781
In our example, we were modeling the film as a two-dimensional surface with no thickness, 

593
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:39,385
and that's perfectly okay for transmission holograms, 

594
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:43,100
but it's worth noting that that changes for white light reflection holograms.

595
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,203
Variations in the exposure through the thickness of that film become 

596
00:36:47,203 --> 00:36:51,180
relevant for filtering out the appropriate wavelengths during reconstruction.

597
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,433
The fact that Dennis Gabor won a Nobel Prize should give you some 

598
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:58,980
hint that the significance here goes beyond its use as an art form.

599
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,636
That clip that I showed earlier where we delicately touch the 

600
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,451
object with a feather is displaying the original scene, 

601
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:08,920
superimposed with its own hologram that we had just freshly recorded.

602
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,500
The dark stripes that you see on the pie creature arise from the extremely 

603
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,480
tiny shifts in position and how that affects the interference of the light.

604
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,260
And you can actually use that to measure the size of those shifts.

605
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,667
This gives a very small glimpse into the relevance that holograms have to interferometry, 

606
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:31,300
which is the technique of using wave interference to measure extremely tiny distances.

607
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,791
More broadly, being able to record and reproduce an entire wavefront 

608
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,560
is just a useful tool to have in your belt for a variety of experiments.

609
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,662
For any of you who want a deeper look at the history and development of 

610
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:47,440
holography and physics, I highly recommend reading Gabor's Nobel Prize lecture.

611
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,279
Throughout the lesson, I've repeatedly referenced the goal of making 

612
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:54,000
holograms feel like something you could have invented yourself.

613
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,689
But there's an irony here, because in his own reflections, 

614
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:00,360
Gabor describes this not as a deliberate discovery.

615
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,307
He called it, quote, an exercise in serendipity, 

616
00:38:03,307 --> 00:38:06,500
the art of looking for something and finding something else.

617
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,885
But luck favors a prepared mind, and the more that you engage with imagined rediscovery 

618
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:20,420
of the inventions that you find around you, the better moment of similar serendipity.

619
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,822
And finally, for the stalwart viewers hungry for the final details, 

620
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:33,140
here's the more formal description of why holography works.

621
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,946
For the small price of introducing complex numbers into the discussion, 

622
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,900
the result kind of just pops out from a few lines of algebra.

623
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,500
So think about recording a hologram where you have both 

624
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,360
a reference wave and an object wave shining on the film.

625
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,160
We're going to write down the sum of those two waves as R plus O.

626
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,259
The exposure pattern depends on the amplitude 

627
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,680
of this combined wave at each point on the film.

628
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,324
And like I said earlier, more precisely, it's 

629
00:38:58,324 --> 00:39:00,520
proportional to the square of that amplitude.

630
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,784
Each of these symbols, say the object wave O, is meant to represent 

631
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:09,909
a function that takes in a point in space, as well as a time, 

632
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:14,700
and returns some real number value describing the strength of the point.

633
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,155
It's an incredibly complicated function, but at a fixed point in space, 

634
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:22,445
this output value simply oscillates up and down over time, 

635
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:26,740
which we've been visualizing throughout as oscillations between blue and red.

636
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,512
Very often, the math that you do with waves has a habit of becoming a 

637
00:39:31,512 --> 00:39:35,217
lot more elegant when you treat an oscillating value like this, 

638
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:40,080
not merely as a real number, but as the real component of a rotating complex number.

639
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,600
This might feel very strange if it's something you haven't seen before, 

640
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,653
but one way to motivate why you might do this is that a complex number very 

641
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:52,919
elegantly encodes both the phase and the amplitude of the wave at a snapshot in 

642
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:53,720
space and time.

643
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,374
The wave amplitude is visible as the size of this value, its distance from the origin, 

644
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:03,560
and the phase is visible as the angle this number makes off the horizontal.

645
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,957
The physical significance when you model things like this is just that the real 

646
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:12,320
component of that rotating complex value tells you the strength of the wave at that point.

647
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,836
But you might think of adding on an imaginary component like 

648
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,893
this as sort of extra bookkeeping that lets you more readily 

649
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:22,100
keep track of the phase and amplitude of the wave at that point.

650
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,420
For example, the amplitude of that combined wave, 

651
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,360
the thing we care about to describe the exposure, 

652
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,830
can now be written as the magnitude of this sum, R plus O, 

653
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,946
where now we're thinking of that as a sum between two complex values at every point on 

654
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:38,240
the plane of the film.

655
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,959
So for example, it places where those two values align, 

656
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:45,277
that corresponds to constructive interference between the waves, 

657
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,320
and the film is going to be more opaque.

658
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,715
Where they are out of phase, you get a really small result, 

659
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,400
and that corresponds to the film being more transparent.

660
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,972
Now think about reconstruction when you just shine 

661
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:59,540
the reference wave through this exposure pattern.

662
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,006
Let's write the wave immediately on the other side of the 

663
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:07,840
film as R times 1 minus the opacity at that point on the film.

664
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,769
So for example, where the film is very transparent, R passes through unchanged, 

665
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:15,880
but where it's more opaque, R is going to get scaled down.

666
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,413
We can go ahead and substitute in the expression for opacity that we have, 

667
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:24,598
and then distribute a little, and what I want to do is focus on analyzing this 

668
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:28,943
component right here, which is going to be part of the wave on this other side of 

669
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:29,420
the film.

670
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,651
When you expand this expression and interpret its terms, 

671
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:35,120
the truth of holography stares right back at you.

672
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,540
To do so, what you need to know about complex numbers is one definition and one fact.

673
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,218
The definition is that the complex conjugate of a number, 

674
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:48,680
which you typically denote with a star, is its reflection over the horizontal axis.

675
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,285
And the fact that you need is that when you multiply a number by its own 

676
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:57,580
complex conjugate, the result is the square of the magnitude of that number.

677
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,911
So in our expression, that exposure term could also be written as 

678
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:07,900
R plus O multiplied by its own complex conjugate, R-star plus O-star.

679
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,355
The reason to do this is now you have something you can expand algebraically, 

680
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:16,744
although admittedly when you do this it might first look like a big pile of symbols 

681
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:21,446
that is very far removed from physical intuition about reconstructing a three-dimensional 

682
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:21,760
scene.

683
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,560
But give it just a moment here.

684
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,800
When you organize the terms the right way, the answer sort of pops out.

685
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,032
Whenever you see a value multiplied by its own complex conjugate, 

686
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:34,400
just think of it as some real number, some scaling factor.

687
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,399
For example, one part in the final expression looks like 

688
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:41,720
some certain real number all times R, the reference wave.

689
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,230
And what this corresponds to is a scaled copy of that 

690
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,000
reference wave here on the other side of the film.

691
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,036
In our simple point example, that would correspond to the zeroth 

692
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,320
order beam from the diffraction grating off the zone plate.

693
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,080
The key term is this part right here.

694
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,880
It looks like some real number, some scaling factor, multiplied by the object wave itself.

695
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,625
So here you are on the other side of the film during reconstruction, 

696
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:13,397
and the expression for the state of the light field includes this scaled copy of 

697
00:43:13,397 --> 00:43:14,340
the object wave.

698
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,698
It doesn't matter how complicated O is, the scene that it 

699
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:20,940
comes from could have whatever complicated optics that you want.

700
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,140
But here on the other side of the film there will always be this scaled copy of o.

701
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,660
In our simple point example, this corresponds to one of those first order beams.

702
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,594
And finally, you have this funny little term at the end 

703
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:37,240
that involves the complex conjugate of the object wave.

704
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,384
This corresponds, as you can probably guess, to the conjugate image, 

705
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:44,000
and maybe now the name makes a little bit more sense.

706
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,248
This is a difficult term to make sense of, and I'm not going to say 

707
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:52,306
too much more about it, other than to show that for the hologram we made, 

708
00:43:52,306 --> 00:43:56,748
if you flip the film around, you can see this conjugate image as a very bizarre, 

709
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:59,600
warped, and reflected version of the original scene.

710
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,600
So that is it.

711
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,757
A little piece of complex algebra shows why you have 

712
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:09,840
a copy of the object wave on the other side of the film.

713
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,000
And importantly, there were no assumptions about how simple that object wave is.

714
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,560
Also, it makes no assumptions about how simple the reference wave is.

715
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,760
You just need to be able to reproduce the same wave that you used during recording, 

716
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,420
or at least something close to it.

717
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,640
Even though this is more powerful, on its own 

718
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,020
I would find this explanation very unsatisfying.

719
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,318
The breakdown of a single point with the zone plate pattern and diffraction gradings, 

720
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:36,540
for all of its shortcomings, gives a lot more intuition in my opinion.

721
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,354
For instance, the algebra tells you nothing about how the film resolution could matter, 

722
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:45,441
but the abstract path and all the power that it brings does offer some reassurance 

723
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:48,840
that the shortcomings in that first explanation are all surmountable.

724
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,620
In his Nobel Prize lecture, Gabor wrote, in holography, nature is on the inventor's side.

725
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,180
You do actually need to say a little bit more to finish the abstract derivation.

726
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,181
Strictly speaking, we've only shown that you have a copy of this 

727
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:06,021
object wave on the plane immediately after the film, 

728
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:10,360
but what you want to show is that it exists in all of 3D space, beyond that film.

729
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,186
Rigorously justifying this would go beyond the scope of an already long lesson, 

730
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:17,300
but it's not too hard a fact to believe.

731
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,350
What we're basically saying is that if you have some function that you know 

732
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,471
satisfies whatever equations light must obey, namely the object wave O, 

733
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:30,821
and you have another function describing a steady state wave where you know 

734
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:34,370
that O shows up as a component along a 2D boundary like this, 

735
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:38,777
then in the free space beyond that boundary, the wave must also include as a 

736
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,380
component O in its entirety.

737
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,587
This actually has a nice connection to the key mystery from the very beginning of 

738
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:50,220
the lesson of how a three-dimensional scene could possibly be stored on 2D film.

739
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,563
Part of what's required for this to be possible is that light 

740
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:58,569
obeys laws regular enough that the state of a light wave in 3D 

741
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:02,640
space is sufficiently constrained by its value on a 2D boundary.
