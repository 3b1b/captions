The Mandelbrot set is one of the most iconic images in all of math.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,966
You start with some complex number, c, and then you recursively define 

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,739
a sequence of complex numbers where the sequence starts with 0, 

4
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:16,280
and each new value is defined to be the square of the previous value, plus c.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,817
So, for example, on the very first iteration, you take 0 squared plus c, 

6
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:25,612
meaning z1 is just c, and then for the next iteration, 

7
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:30,373
you take that number squared plus c, meaning z2 is c squared plus c, 

8
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,960
and so on and so forth.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,080
Each new value is the square of the previous plus c.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,614
Depending on the choice for that value c, sometimes the sequence stays bounded, 

11
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,540
and sometimes it blows up to infinity.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,562
If you color all of the values of c that cause this process to stay bounded black, 

13
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:49,762
and you apply some gradient of colors to the other values, 

14
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:53,722
where the color depends on how quickly the process blows up to infinity, 

15
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,380
you get this iconic, cardioid-with-bubbles shape.
