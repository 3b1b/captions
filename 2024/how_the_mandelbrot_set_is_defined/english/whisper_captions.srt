The Mandelbrot set is one of the most iconic images in all of math.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,160
You start with some complex number, c, and then you recursively define a sequence of complex numbers

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:16,280
where the sequence starts with 0, and each new value is defined to be the square of the previous value, plus c.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,440
So, for example, on the very first iteration, you take 0 squared plus c, meaning z1 is just c,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,400
and then for the next iteration, you take that number squared plus c, meaning z2 is c squared plus c,

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,080
and so on and so forth. Each new value is the square of the previous plus c.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,540
Depending on the choice for that value c, sometimes the sequence stays bounded, and sometimes it blows up to infinity.

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,000
If you color all of the values of c that cause this process to stay bounded black,

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,280
and you apply some gradient of colors to the other values,

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,760
where the color depends on how quickly the process blows up to infinity, you get this iconic, cardioid-with-bubbles shape.
