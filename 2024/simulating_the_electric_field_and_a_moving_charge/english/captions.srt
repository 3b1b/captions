00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
I recently had a lot of fun making simulations for 

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,220
how the electric field responds to a moving charge.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,501
It was all for a longer video on YouTube that covers the fundamentals of what light is, 

4
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:12,180
but here I just thought I'd share with you some of the pretty 

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,520
animations that came out of it.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,260
The full electric field is three-dimensional.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,105
It associates each point in space with a little vector telling you what force 

8
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:25,360
would be applied to a unit charge if it were sitting at that point in space.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,067
The 3D fields are fun to look at, but they are a bit busy, 

10
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:33,280
so often it's easier to just show a slice of that field, say on the xy plane.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,620
In the main video I talk about the underlying law used to make these simulations.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,406
It's not actually Maxwell's equations, which are the 

13
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:42,960
fundamental laws underlying electricity and magnetism.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,388
Instead I'm coding in another intermediate law, 

15
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:47,965
something that you can derive from Maxwell's equations, 

16
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,496
but which is a little easier to wrap your mind around, 

17
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:53,625
both for the sake of making the animations and also for the sake of 

18
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,880
the student trying to understand what's going on.
