00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,989
Intro 00:00:01,989 --&gt;
This is a video for anyone who already knows

2
00:00:06,060 3
what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are, and
who might enjoy a quick way to compute them

a trükk,
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,080
in the case of 2x2 matrices. If you’re unfamiliar
with eigenvalues, take a look at this video
de ha
4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,870
which introduces them.
lehetséges, szeretném, ha
5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,349
You can skip ahead if you just want to see
újra felfedeznéd

6
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:23,349
magadnak, ezért
let’s lay down a little background.

7
00:00:23,349 --&gt;
As a quick reminder, if the effect of a linear
transformation on a given vector is to scale

00:00:28,550 8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,250
it by some constant, we call it an "eigenvector"
of the transformation, and we call the relevant
gyakran lambda betűvel
9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,981
scaling factor the corresponding "eigenvalue,"
jelöljük. Amikor

10
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:47,320
ezt egyenletként írja fel,
a little bit, what you see is that if the

11
és átrendezi a 00:00:47,320
number lambda is an eigenvalue of a matrix
A, then the matrix (A minus lambda times the

--&gt; 00:00:53,190 00:00:53,190 értéket,
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,220
identity) must send some nonzero vector, namely
the corresponding eigenvector, to the zero
a módosított mátrix 12-jének
13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,999
vector, which in turn means the determinant
0-nak kell lennie.

14
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:09,960
Oké, ez mind
to say, but again, I’m assuming all of this

15
egy kis
is review for anyone watching.

16
falat 00:01:09,960 --&gt;
So, the usual way to compute eigenvalues,
how I used to do it, and how I believe most

00:01:12,829 00:01:12,829
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,179
students are taught to carry it out, is to
subtract the unknown value lambda off the
--&gt; 00:01:17,939 17
18
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:27,890
diagonals and then solve for when the determinant
egyenlő 0-val.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,630
Ennek mindig néhány
expand out and simplify to get a clean quadratic

20
lépést kell tennie
polynomial, what's known as the “characteristic
polynomial” of the matrix. The eigenvalues

a 00:01:32,630 --&gt;
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:43,170
are the roots of this polynomial. So to find
them you have to apply the quadratic formula,
00:01:38,069 további 21
22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,050
which itself typically requires one or two
egyszerűsítési lépésig.

23
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:52,710
Őszintén szólva, a folyamat nem szörnyű. De
at least for 2x2 matrices, there’s a much

24
00:01:52,710 --&gt; 00:01:57,049
more direct way to get at this answer. And
if you want to rediscover this trick, there

25 ennek
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,929
are only three relevant facts you need to
know, each of which is worth knowing in its
a két átlós
26
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,899
own right and can help you with other problem-solving.
bejegyzésnek az összege
27
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,979
Number 1: The trace of a matrix, which is
egyenlő a

28
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,700
sajátértékek összegével. Vagy
way to phrase it, more useful for our purposes,

29
egy másik 00:02:14,700 --&gt;
is that the mean of the two eigenvalues is
the same as the mean of these two diagonal

00:02:18,959 30 31
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,959
entries.

értelme van, ha
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:27,810
Number 2: The determinant of a matrix, our
usual ad-bc formula, is equal to the product
megérti, hogy a sajátértékek
32
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,890
of the two eigenvalues. And this should kind

teret 00:02:37,720 --&gt;
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:46,550
Now before getting to the third fact, notice
how you can essentially read these first two
00:02:42,189 35 sokkal lefelé.
36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,970
values out of the matrix without really writing
Vegyük példának ezt a mátrixot.

37
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,970
Azonnal tudhatja,
the eigenvalues is the same as the mean of

hogy a
8 and 6, which is 7. Likewise, most linear
algebra students are pretty well-practiced

00:02:55,970 --&gt;
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,909
at finding the determinant, which in this
case works out to be 48 - 8 So right away
00:03:02,420 39
40
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,890
you know that the product of our two eigenvalues
átlaga 40.

41
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,079
Most szánjon egy pillanatot, és
what will be our third relevant fact, which

42
nézze meg, hogyan származtathatja
is how to recover two numbers when you know
their mean and you know their product.

a 00:03:17,079 --&gt; 00:03:21,860
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,959
Here, let's focus on this example. You know
the two values are evenly spaced around 7,
43 43 szót, nevezzük
44
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,959
so they look like 7 plus or minus something;
ezt a távolságot &quot;d&quot;-nek.

45
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,239
Azt is tudja, hogy
numbers is 40. Now to find d, notice that

46
ennek a két
this product expands really nicely, it works
out as a difference of squares. So from there,

00:03:40,239 --&gt; 00:03:45,480 47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,120
you can directly find d: d^2 is 7^2 - 40,
or 9, which means d itself is 3.
konkrét példa szorzata
48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,930
In other words, the two values for this very
4 és 10.

49
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,239
De a célunk egy
want to think this through each time, so let’s

50
gyors trükk, és
wrap up what we just did in a general formula.
For any mean, m and product, p, the distance

nem 00:04:06,239 --&gt;
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:20,209
squared is always going to be m^2 - p. This
gives the third key fact, which is that when
00:04:12,610 51 ezt a
52
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,660
two numbers have a mean m and a product p,
két számot m

53
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,150
± sqrt(m^2 -

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,490
p) alakban írhatja le.
if you ever forget it, and it’s essentially

55
menet közben 00:04:34,490
just a rephrasing of the difference of squares
formula. But even still it’s a fact worth

--&gt; 00:04:39,360 56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,610
memorizing so that you have it at the tip
of your fingers.
írt nekünk egy gyors
57
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,520
In fact, my friend Tim from the channel acapellascience
csilingelést, hogy egy

58
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,500
kicsit emlékezetesebb legyen.

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,880
m plusz vagy mínusz
minus p (ping!)

60
squaaare négyzetgyöke 00:04:53,880
Let me show you how this works, say for the
matrix [[3,1], [4,1]]. You start by bringing

--&gt; 00:04:59,069 61
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:08,330
to mind the formula, maybe stating it all
in your head. But when you write it down,
p ahogy megy.
62
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,551
you fill in the appropriate values of m and
Tehát ebben a

63
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:19,030
példában a sajátértékek átlaga
of 3 and 1, which is 2. So the thing you start

64
megegyezik az átlaggal 00:05:19,030
writing is 2 ± sqrt(2^2 - …). Then the
product of the eigenvalues is the determinant,

--&gt; 00:05:26,780 65 felismerheti,
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:35,090
which in this example is 3*1 - 1*4, or -1.
So that’s the final thing you fill in. This
hogy ez ugyanaz a
66
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,319
means the eigenvalues are 2±sqrt(5). You
mátrix, amelyet az

67
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,370
elején használtam, de figyelje
much more directly we can get at the answer.

68
meg, hogy 00: 05:47,370
Here, try another one. This time the mean
of the eigenvalues is the same as the mean

--&gt; 00:05:52,190 69 a
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,870
of 2 and 8, which is 5. So again, you start
writing out the formula but this time writing
2*8 - 7*1 vagy
70
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:10,900
5 in place of m [song]. And then the determinant
9. Tehát ebben a

71
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:19,590
példában a sajátértékek
simplifies even further as 9 and 1.

72
úgy néznek ki, mint
You see what I mean about how you can basically
just start writing down the eigenvalues while

5 ± sqrt(16), ami
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,470
staring at the matrix? It’s typically just
the tiniest bit of simplifying at the end.
00:06:19,590 --&gt; 00:06:23,800
74
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,800
Honestly, I’ve found myself using this trick
73 nagyon sok, ha

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,039
lineáris algebrával kapcsolatos gyors
as examples. I’ve been working on a video

76
jegyzeteket vázolok, és
about matrix exponents, where eigenvalues
pop up a lot, and I realized it’s just very

kis mátrixokat szeretnék használni.
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,960
handy if students can read off the eigenvalues
from small examples without losing the main
00:06:37,039 --&gt; 00:06:41,800 77
78
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,340
line of thought by getting bogged down in
egy másik számítás.

79
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,190
Egy másik szórakoztató példaként
set of three different matrices, which come

80
vessen egy pillantást erre
up a lot in quantum mechanics, they're known
as the Pauli spin matrices. If you know quantum

a 00:06:54,190 --&gt; 00:06:59,419
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,710
mechanics, you’ll know that the eigenvalues
of matrices are highly relevant to the physics
81 mechanikára, legyen ez
82
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,060
they describe, and if you don’t know quantum
csak egy kis

83
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,639
bepillantás arról, hogy ezek
to real applications.

84
a számítások mennyire relevánsak
The mean of the diagonal in all three cases
is 0, so the mean of the eigenvalues in all

00:07:12,639 --&gt; 00: 07:19,990
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,870
cases is 0, which makes our formula look especially
simple.
85 ezeknek a
86
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,840
What about the products of the eigenvalues,
mátrixoknak a meghatározói? Az elsőnél

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,430
0 - 1 vagy -1. A
also looks like 0 - 1, but it takes a moment

88
második 00:07:36,430 --&gt; 00:07:42,310
more to see because of the complex numbers.
And the final one looks like -1 - 0. So in

89 tudja, hogy
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,060
all cases, the eigenvalues simplify to be
±1. Although in this case, you really don’t
egyenletesen 0 körül
90
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,080
need the formula to find two values if you
helyezkednek el, és

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
a szorzatuk -1.

92
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,759
Ha kíváncsi vagy, a
mechanics, these matrices describe observations

93
kvantum kontextusában 00:07:59,759
you might make about a particle's spin in
the x, y or z directions. The fact that their

--&gt; 00:08:04,470 94 vagy
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,810
eigenvalues are ±1 corresponds with the idea
that the values for the spin that you would
teljesen másban, nem
95
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,419
observe would be either entirely in one direction
pedig valami folyamatosan a

96
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,680
kettő között. Talán
wonder how exactly this works, or why you

97
00:08:20,680 --&gt;
would use 2x2 matrices that have complex numbers
to describe spin in three dimensions. And

00:08:26,259 98 00:08:26,259
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,500
those would be fair questions, just outside
the scope of what I want to talk about here.
98 mert
99
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,990
You know it’s funny, I wrote this section
szerettem volna

100
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,970
egy olyan
or homework problems, ones where they actually

101
esetet, ahol 2x2
come up in practice, and quantum mechanics
is great for that. But the thing is after

mátrixok vannak,
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,940
I made it I realized that the whole example
kind of undercuts the point I’m trying to
amelyek nem
103
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,420
make. For these specific matrices, when you
csak játék

104
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,700
példák 00:08:38,970
it might actually faster. I mean, take a look

105
--&gt; 00:08:43,880 102
a the first one: The relevant determinant
directly gives you a characteristic polynomial

hagyományos módszer,
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,570
of lambda^2 - 1, and clearly, that has roots
of plus and minus 1. Same answer when you
amelyik jellegzetes
107
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:16,480
do the second matrix, lambda^2 - 1. And as
polinomokkal rendelkezik,

108
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,940
lényegében ugyanolyan gyors;
already a diagonal matrix, so those diagonal

109
-&gt; &gt;
entries are the eigenvalues!

110
00:09:28,850 111
However, the example is not totally lost to
our cause. Where you will actually feel the

egy, plusz
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,260
speed up is in the more general case where
you take a linear combination of these three
b-szer a második,
112
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,760
matrices and then try to compute the eigenvalues.
plusz c-szer
113
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,000
You might write this as a times the first
a harmadik.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,360
A kvantummechanikában ez
describe spin observations in a general direction

115
00:09:47,360 --&gt; 00:09:53,240
of a vector with coordinates [a, b, c]. More
specifically, you should assume this vector

116 továbbra is
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:01,269
is normalized, meaning a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1.
When you look at this new matrix, it’s immediate
nulla, és akkor
117
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,889
to see that the mean of the eigenvalues is
is élvezheti, ha

118
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:13,560
egy pillanatra megáll,
of those eigenvalues is still -1, and then

119
hogy megbizonyosodjon arról, hogy
from there concluding what the eigenvalues
must be. And this time, the characteristic

a termék 00:10:13,560
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,860
polynomial approach would be by comparison
a lot more cumbersome, definitely harder to
--&gt; 00:10: 18
121
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,190
do in your head.
710 120 alapvetően
122
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,220
To be clear, using the mean-product formula
nem különbözik a

123
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,110
karakterisztikus polinom gyökeinek
mean, it can't be, they're solving the same

124
megtalálásától; I 00:10:33,110
problem. One way to think about this, actually,
is that the mean-product formula is a nice

--&gt; 00:10:37,160 125
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,480
way to solve quadratic in general (and some
viewers of the channel may recognize this).
egy másodfokú gyökei
126
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,140
This about it: When you’re trying to find
együtthatói alapján, ez egy

127
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,950
másik helyzet, amikor
sum of two values, and you also know their

128
ismeri a 00:10:50,950
product, but you’re trying to recover the
original two values.

--&gt; 00:10:54,820 129
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,420
Specifically, if the polynomial is normalized
so that this leading coefficient is 1, then
lineáris együtthatót, ami
130
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,030
the mean of the roots will be -½ times this
-1-szerese ezen gyökerek

131
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,820
összegének. A 00:11:12,820
screen that makes the mean 5. And the product

132
--&gt; 00:11:17,610
of the roots is even easier, it’s just the
constant term no adjustments needed. So from

133 példában a
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,339
there, you would apply the mean product formula
and that gives you the roots.
hagyományos másodfokú
134
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:29,300
On the one hand, you could think of this as
képlet könnyebb

135
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,200
változata. De az
is that it's fewer symbols to memorize, it's

136
igazi előny 00:11:34,200
that each one of them carries more meaning
with it.

--&gt; 00:11:37,370 137
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,610
The whole point of this eigenvalue trick is
that because you can read out the mean and
nem kell átmennie
138
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,760
product directly from looking at the matrix,

You can jump straight to writing down the

140
00:11:49,930 --&gt; 00:11:54,339
roots without ever explicitly thinking about
what the polynomial looks like. But to do

141 egy nagyon
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:00,660
that we need a version of the quadratic formula
where the terms carry some kind of meaning.
speciális közönség számára,

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,550
I realize that this is a very specific trick,
de bárcsak tudtam

The hope is that it’s not just one more
thing to memorize, but that the framing reinforces

00:12 :10,330 --&gt;
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,660
some other nice facts worth knowing, like
how the trace and determinant relate to eigenvalues.
