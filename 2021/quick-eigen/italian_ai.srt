what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are, and
who might enjoy a quick way to compute them

trucco, ma se
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,080
in the case of 2x2 matrices. If you’re unfamiliar
with eigenvalues, take a look at this video

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,870
which introduces them.

You can skip ahead if you just want to see
riscoprissi da solo,

6
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:23,349
quindi per quello
let’s lay down a little background.

7
00:00:23,349 --&gt; 00:00:28,550
As a quick reminder, if the effect of a linear
transformation on a given vector is to scale

8 spesso
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,250
it by some constant, we call it an "eigenvector"
of the transformation, and we call the relevant
indicato con la

00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,981
scaling factor the corresponding "eigenvalue,"
lettera lambda. Quando

10
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:47,320
lo scrivi come
a little bit, what you see is that if the

11
un&#39;equazione e riorganizzi 00:00:47,320
number lambda is an eigenvalue of a matrix
A, then the matrix (A minus lambda times the

--&gt; 00:00:53,190 12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,220
identity) must send some nonzero vector, namely
the corresponding eigenvector, to the zero
di questa matrice modificata
13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,999
vector, which in turn means the determinant
deve essere 0.

14
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:09,960
Ok, è tutto
to say, but again, I’m assuming all of this

15
un boccone 00:01:09,960
is review for anyone watching.

16
--&gt; 00:01:12,829
So, the usual way to compute eigenvalues,
how I used to do it, and how I believe most

00:01:12,829 --&gt; 00:01:17,939
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,179
students are taught to carry it out, is to
subtract the unknown value lambda off the
17 è uguale
18
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:27,890
diagonals and then solve for when the determinant
a 0.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,630
Fare questo implica
expand out and simplify to get a clean quadratic

20
sempre qualche passo
polynomial, what's known as the “characteristic
polynomial” of the matrix. The eigenvalues

per 00:01:32,630 --&gt;
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:43,170
are the roots of this polynomial. So to find
them you have to apply the quadratic formula,
00:01:38,069 altri 21
22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,050
which itself typically requires one or two
passi di semplificazione.

23
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:52,710
Onestamente, il processo non è terribile. Ma
at least for 2x2 matrices, there’s a much

24
00:01:52,710 --&gt; 00:01:57,049
more direct way to get at this answer. And
if you want to rediscover this trick, there

25 la somma
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,929
are only three relevant facts you need to
know, each of which is worth knowing in its

Number 1: The trace of a matrix, which is

degli autovalori. Oppure
way to phrase it, more useful for our purposes,

29
un altro 00:02:14,700 --&gt;
is that the mean of the two eigenvalues is
the same as the mean of these two diagonal

00:02:18,959 30 31
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,959
entries.

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:27,810
Number 2: The determinant of a matrix, our
usual ad-bc formula, is equal to the product

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,890
of the two eigenvalues. And this should kind

(or volumes) as a whole.

--&gt; 00:02:42,189 35
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:46,550
Now before getting to the third fact, notice
how you can essentially read these first two
molto verso il basso.
36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,970
values out of the matrix without really writing
Prendi questa matrice qui come esempio.

8 and 6, which is 7. Likewise, most linear
algebra students are pretty well-practiced

di 00:02:55,970
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,909
at finding the determinant, which in this
case works out to be 48 - 8 So right away
--&gt; 00:03:02,420 39
40
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,890
you know that the product of our two eigenvalues
è 40.

41
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,079
Ora prenditi un momento
what will be our third relevant fact, which

42
per vedere come puoi
is how to recover two numbers when you know
their mean and you know their product.

derivare 00:03:17,079 --&gt; 00:03:21,860
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,959
Here, let's focus on this example. You know
the two values are evenly spaced around 7,
43 chiamiamo quel qualcosa
44
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,959
so they look like 7 plus or minus something;
&quot;d&quot; per la distanza.

45
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,239
Sai anche che il
numbers is 40. Now to find d, notice that

46
prodotto di questi due
this product expands really nicely, it works
out as a difference of squares. So from there,

00:03:40,239 --&gt; 00:03:45,480 47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,120
you can directly find d: d^2 is 7^2 - 40,
or 9, which means d itself is 3.
esempio specifico risulta essere
48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,930
In other words, the two values for this very
4 e 10.

49
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,239
Ma il nostro obiettivo è
want to think this through each time, so let’s

50
un trucchetto veloce, e
wrap up what we just did in a general formula.
For any mean, m and product, p, the distance

non 00:04:06,239 --&gt; 00:04:12,610
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:20,209
squared is always going to be m^2 - p. This
gives the third key fact, which is that when
51 puoi scrivere questi
52
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,660
two numbers have a mean m and a product p,
due numeri come m

53
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,150
± sqrt(m^2 - p)

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,490
Questo è abbastanza veloce
if you ever forget it, and it’s essentially

55
da ridirigere al volo
just a rephrasing of the difference of squares
formula. But even still it’s a fact worth

00:04:34,490 --&gt; 00:04:39,360 56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,610
memorizing so that you have it at the tip
of your fingers.

In fact, my friend Tim from the channel acapellascience
breve jingle per renderlo

58
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,500
un po&#39; più memorabile.

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,880
m più o meno radice
minus p (ping!)

60
squaaaare di me al
Let me show you how this works, say for the
matrix [[3,1], [4,1]]. You start by bringing

quadrato 00:04:53,880 --&gt; 00:04:59,069 61
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:08,330
to mind the formula, maybe stating it all
in your head. But when you write it down,
p man mano che
62
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,551
you fill in the appropriate values of m and
procedi. Quindi in questo esempio,

63
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:19,030
la media degli autovalori
of 3 and 1, which is 2. So the thing you start

64
è la stessa della
writing is 2 ± sqrt(2^2 - …). Then the
product of the eigenvalues is the determinant,

media 00:05:19,030 --&gt; 00:05:26,780
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:35,090
which in this example is 3*1 - 1*4, or -1.
So that’s the final thing you fill in. This
65 potresti riconoscere che questa
66
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,319
means the eigenvalues are 2±sqrt(5). You
è la stessa matrice

67
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,370
che stavo usando all&#39;inizio,
much more directly we can get at the answer.

68
ma nota come 00:
Here, try another one. This time the mean
of the eigenvalues is the same as the mean

05:47,370 --&gt; 00:05:52,190 69
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,870
of 2 and 8, which is 5. So again, you start
writing out the formula but this time writing
è 2*8 - 7*1 o
70
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:10,900
5 in place of m [song]. And then the determinant
9. Quindi in questo

71
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:19,590
esempio, gli autovalori
simplifies even further as 9 and 1.

72
assomigliano a 5 ±
You see what I mean about how you can basically
just start writing down the eigenvalues while

sqrt(16), che 00:06:19,590
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,470
staring at the matrix? It’s typically just
the tiniest bit of simplifying at the end.
--&gt; 00:06:23,800 73 è
74
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,800
Honestly, I’ve found myself using this trick
molto quando sto abbozzando

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,039
appunti rapidi relativi
as examples. I’ve been working on a video

76
all&#39;algebra lineare e voglio
about matrix exponents, where eigenvalues
pop up a lot, and I realized it’s just very

usare matrici piccole
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,960
handy if students can read off the eigenvalues
from small examples without losing the main
00:06:37,039 --&gt; 00:06:41,800 77
78
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,340
line of thought by getting bogged down in
un calcolo diverso.

79
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,190
Come altro esempio divertente,
set of three different matrices, which come

80
dai un&#39;occhiata a questa
up a lot in quantum mechanics, they're known
as the Pauli spin matrices. If you know quantum

00:06:54,190 --&gt; 00:06:59,419 81
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,710
mechanics, you’ll know that the eigenvalues
of matrices are highly relevant to the physics
meccanica, lascia che sia
82
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,060
they describe, and if you don’t know quantum

83

assaggio di come questi
to real applications.

84
calcoli siano effettivamente rilevanti
The mean of the diagonal in all three cases
is 0, so the mean of the eigenvalues in all

00:07:12,639 --&gt; 00: 07:19,990
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,870
cases is 0, which makes our formula look especially
simple.
85 le determinanti
86
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,840
What about the products of the eigenvalues,
di queste matrici? Per il

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,430
primo è 0 - 1 o -1. I secondi
also looks like 0 - 1, but it takes a moment

88
00:07:36,430 --&gt; 00:07:42,310
more to see because of the complex numbers.
And the final one looks like -1 - 0. So in

89 sanno che sono
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,060
all cases, the eigenvalues simplify to be
±1. Although in this case, you really don’t
equidistanti attorno allo
90
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,080
need the formula to find two values if you
0 e il loro

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
prodotto è -1.

92
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,759
Se sei curioso, nel contesto
mechanics, these matrices describe observations

93
quantistico 00:07:59,759 --&gt; 00:08:04,470
you might make about a particle's spin in
the x, y or z directions. The fact that their

94 o interamente in
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,810
eigenvalues are ±1 corresponds with the idea
that the values for the spin that you would
un altro, in contrapposizione
95
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,419
observe would be either entirely in one direction
a qualcosa che sta

96
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,680
continuamente nel mezzo. Forse
wonder how exactly this works, or why you

97
dovresti 00:08:20,680 --&gt; 00:08:26,259
would use 2x2 matrices that have complex numbers
to describe spin in three dimensions. And

98 perché volevo
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,500
those would be fair questions, just outside
the scope of what I want to talk about here.
un caso in cui
99
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,990
You know it’s funny, I wrote this section
hai matrici 2x2

100
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,970
che non sono solo
or homework problems, ones where they actually

101
esempi giocattolo 00:08:38,970
come up in practice, and quantum mechanics
is great for that. But the thing is after

--&gt; 00:08:43,880 102 usare
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,940
I made it I realized that the whole example
kind of undercuts the point I’m trying to
il metodo il
103
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,420
make. For these specific matrices, when you
metodo tradizionale, quello con

104
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,700
i polinomi caratteristici,
it might actually faster. I mean, take a look

105
è sostanzialmente altrettanto veloce;
a the first one: The relevant determinant
directly gives you a characteristic polynomial

00:08:58,700 --&gt; 00:09:03,390
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,570
of lambda^2 - 1, and clearly, that has roots
of plus and minus 1. Same answer when you
106 per l&#39;ultima matrice,
107
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:16,480
do the second matrix, lambda^2 - 1. And as
dimentica di fare

108
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,940
qualsiasi calcolo, tradizionale o
already a diagonal matrix, so those diagonal

109
meno, è 00:09:20,940
entries are the eigenvalues!

110
--&gt; 00:09:23,510 00:09:23,510 --
However, the example is not totally lost to
our cause. Where you will actually feel the

&gt; 00:09:28.850 111
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,260
speed up is in the more general case where
you take a linear combination of these three
uno, più b per
112
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,760
matrices and then try to compute the eigenvalues.
il secondo, più
113
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,000
You might write this as a times the first
c per il terzo.

Nella meccanica quantistica, questo

specifically, you should assume this vector

00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:01,269
is normalized, meaning a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1.
When you look at this new matrix, it’s immediate
a zero, e potresti
117
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,889
to see that the mean of the eigenvalues is

fondamentalmente diverso dal trovare

To be clear, using the mean-product formula

is that the mean-product formula is a nice

way to solve quadratic in general (and some
viewers of the channel may recognize this).

sum of two values, and you also know their

original two values.

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,420
Specifically, if the polynomial is normalized
so that this leading coefficient is 1, then
che è -1 volte
130
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,030
the mean of the roots will be -½ times this
la somma di quelle

131
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,820
radici. Per l&#39;esempio
screen that makes the mean 5. And the product

132
su 00:11:12,820 --&gt;
of the roots is even easier, it’s just the
constant term no adjustments needed. So from

00:11:17,610 133 una
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,339
there, you would apply the mean product formula
and that gives you the roots.
versione più leggera
134

On the one hand, you could think of this as

is that it's fewer symbols to memorize, it's

that each one of them carries more meaning
with it.

00:11:37,370 137 non è

The whole point of this eigenvalue trick is
that because you can read out the mean and

what the polynomial looks like. But to do

00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:00,660
that we need a version of the quadratic formula
where the terms carry some kind of meaning.

I realize that this is a very specific trick,

The hope is that it’s not just one more
thing to memorize, but that the framing reinforces

some other nice facts worth knowing, like
how the trace and determinant relate to eigenvalues.

If you want to prove those facts, by the way,
