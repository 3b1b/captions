Intro 00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:06,060 3   the trick, but if possible I’d like you to rediscover it for yourself, so for that 00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:28,550 8  often denoted with the letter lambda.
When you write this as an equation and you rearrange 00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,190 12  of this modified matrix must be 0.
Okay, that’s all a little bit of a mouthful 00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,829 00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:17,939 17  equals 0.
Doing this always involves a few steps to 00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:38,069 21  more steps of simplification.
Honestly, the process isn’t terrible.
But 00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,049 25   the sum of these two diagonal entries, is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues.
Or another 00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,959 30 31  of make sense if you understand that eigenvalues describe how much an operator stretches space 00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,189 35  much down.
Take this matrix here as an example.
Straight away you can know that the mean of 00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,420 39  is 40.
Now take a moment to see how you can derive 00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,860 43  let’s call that something "d" for distance.
You also know that the product of these two 00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,480 47  specific example work out to be 4 and 10.
But our goal is a quick trick, and you wouldn’t 00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,610 51  you can write those two numbers as m ± sqrt(m^2 - p) This is decently fast to rederive on the fly 00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,360 56  wrote us a quick jingle to make it a little more memorable.
m plus or minus squaaaare root of me squared 00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,069 61  p as you go.
So in this example, the mean of the eigenvalues is the same as the mean 00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:26,780 65  might recognize that this is the same matrix I was using at the beginning, but notice how 00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,190 69  is 2*8 - 7*1, or 9.
So in this example, the eigenvalues look like 5 ± sqrt(16), which 00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,800 73  a lot when I’m sketching quick notes related to linear algebra and want to use small matrices 00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,800 77  a different calculation.
As another fun example, take a look at this 00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,419 81  mechanics, let this just be a little glimpse of how these computations are actually relevant 00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,990 85  the determinants of these matrices?
For the first one, it’s 0 - 1 or -1.
The second 00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,310 89  know theyr'e evenly spaced around 0 and their product is -1.
If you’re curious, in the context of quantum 00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,470 94  or entirely in another, as opposed to something continuously ranging in between.
Maybe you’d 00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,259 98  because I wanted some case where you have 2x2 matrices that are not just toy examples 00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,880 102  use the traditional method, the one with characteristic polynomials, it’s essentially just as fast; 00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,390 106  for the last matrix, forget about doing any computations, traditional or otherwise, it’s 00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,510 00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,850 111   one, plus b times the second, plus c times the third.
In quantum mechanics, this would 00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,240 116  still zero, and you might also enjoy pausing for a brief moment to confirm that the product 00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,710 120   is not fundamentally different from finding roots of the characteristic polynomial; I 00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,160 125  the roots of a quadratic given its coefficients, that's another situation where you know the 00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,820 129  linear coefficient, which is -1 times the sum of those roots.
For the example on the 00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,610 133  a lighter-weight version of the traditional quadratic formula.
But the real advantage 00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,370 137  you don't need to go through the intermediate step of setting up the characteristic polynomial.
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,339 141  for a very specific audience, but it’s something I wish I knew in college, so if you happen 00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,330 00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,140 146  take a moment to expand out the characteristic polynomial for a general matrix, and think 00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,420 150  in particular, is one of the greatest things on the internet.
