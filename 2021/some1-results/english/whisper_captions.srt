00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
This summer, James Schloss and I ran a contest that's meant to encourage more people to make

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,100
online math explainers, and here I want to share with you some of my favorites.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,760
I wrote up a much fuller blog post about the event and the process for selecting winners,

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,120
but let's open here with some of the key points.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,240
First of all, it was extremely open-ended. It's meant for math explainers of any kind,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,120
any medium, any target audience, any topic, pretty much just as long as it's about math.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,620
The promise was to select around 4-5 to be winners, which I would then feature in a video,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,340
here we are now, and after I made the initial announcement, Brilliant came in and kindly

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,440
offered cash prizes to those winners. Before anything, let me just emphasize

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,940
this notion of a winner should really be taken with a heavy grain of salt.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,860
The spirit of the event, and hopefully this is obvious, is to get more people sharing their

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,200
knowledge, and preferably to have them do so in a way that's as engaging and empathetic and novel

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,100
as possible. The way I see it, there's some benefits to framing it as a contest,

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,580
like we have a clear deadline, and that can be a great cure for perfectionism and stagnation.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,940
Also, having some small stakes involved hopefully means that the lessons are put together with a

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,280
little bit more care, and with a little bit more attention to the kind of principles that I wanted

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,540
to emphasize with the whole event. The downside, which is not to be taken lightly, is that it gives

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,400
the false impression that success looks like winning, but it does not. Success means having

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,100
more material out there that explains math and inspires people to engage with it. Ten years from

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,720
now, no one is going to remember my arbitrary selections, but every one of the pieces made will

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,120
still exist and will still potentially help someone trying to learn. We received over 1200 submissions,

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,780
and as a first pass for the judgment we had a peer review process to help filter that down to a

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,880
little over 100 that James and I could give a really close look at. We also had around half a

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,460
dozen guest judges, people in the space of math exposition, to help us narrow down those final

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,160
judgments. Many, many thanks to those guests for being willing to volunteer some of their time,

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,880
and generally helping to ensure that any of my subjective quirks weren't leaking too much into

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,600
the final decision. Also, a million thanks to James. He really was the core organizer behind

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,380
everything here, and if you participated in the event and found it helpful, he is absolutely the

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,860
one you should be thanking. As I said, there's a blog post with more details for any of you who are

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,340
curious, but right now, without further ado, let me tell you about some outstanding math explainers

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,060
that I really think you're going to enjoy. This entry, from a channel called Paralogical,

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,840
opens by asking why the light reflected at the bottom of a mug seems to form this characteristic

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,220
cardioid shape. The core mathematical idea that this video teaches is that of envelopes, which in

34
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,220
short is a way to describe one curve using a family of other curves, and what really makes the video

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,340
special is not just how clearly he explains that subject, but how tangible and well-chosen the

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,140
examples are, all delivered with a tone that's just plain friendly and enjoyable to listen to.

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,760
The key formula he builds up to is really well motivated, and one of those things that would not

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,580
be obvious if you just saw it out of context, and he gives the tools for any curious viewer to pause

39
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,740
and work through for themselves a more detailed understanding, while still leaving room for

40
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,600
someone watching to get the general idea and the core points without necessarily being bogged down

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,760
into that algebra. On the topic of fun ways that light gets redirected, another one of my picks is

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,660
an absolutely mind-blowing piece of engineering wizardry. This one is a blog post written by Matt

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,020
Ferraro, where he explains how he made this acrylic square. It might look innocent at first,

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,360
like nothing more than a transparent square, maybe suspiciously wavy, but when you look at its shadow

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
you can see that it's been carefully crafted to redirect light in such a way as to form a highly

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,700
deliberate image. The post walks through all of the math and the algorithms involved in pulling

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,660
this off, including certain false starts in the discovery process, which I love, and the author

48
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,960
skillfully draws the reader's attention to which details are important and deserve more of your

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,040
focus, and which ones are more side notes and minutiae. I found myself a little surprised about

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,440
what parts of the process turned out to be hard and which ones were easy, and by the end the whole

51
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,680
task felt a lot less mysterious while still commanding no shortage of respect for the fact

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,720
that someone was actually able to pull it off. The next pick that I have on my list here, I'll

53
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,700
feel a little torn about, I wouldn't be surprised if many of you have already seen this video,

54
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,720
it's called The Beauty of BÃ©zier Curves by Freya Homare. Given the spirit of the contest,

55
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,920
which is to encourage people to share their knowledge without necessarily getting intimidated

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,480
by a need for high production quality, you know, focus on the quality of the lesson more so than

57
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,780
the medium used to express it, this video was so beautifully produced I almost felt like choosing

58
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,420
it risked sending the wrong message. Also, part of the goal here is to shine a light on comparatively

59
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,420
unknown creators, and by the time I was watching this one it had around 400,000 views. But the thing

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,760
is, Freya's video really is a fantastic piece of exposition, and it would be a little bit silly of

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,540
me to fault it for also being beautiful and evidently also being appreciated by many people

62
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,940
in both respects. I do want to be clear, the reason that I'm choosing it is not because of the smooth

63
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,720
graphics, it's that here we have someone who uses a certain mathematical tool regularly in her work,

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,820
and she has the ability to clearly motivate why you should care too, and to go into the details

65
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,480
of how it works, the many different facets of how she uses it, how she thinks about it, and what

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,800
makes it visually great is not so much the smoothness of the graphics or the aesthetic appeal,

67
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,680
it's that they're clean and to the point, serving to aid what's the core value in the whole piece,

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,360
a series of well-chosen intuitions and applications of a topic in math that deserves to be known by

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,660
more people. After that one I really did think that with my other picks I could help direct the

70
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,220
audience of this channel to some excellent lessons that you might not have seen yet, like with the

71
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,840
next one I chose. When I saw it, it had a couple hundred views and I really loved it and I was

72
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,440
excited to share it with you all. But then it looks like the internet kind of beat me to it,

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,140
this thing is quickly going on a million views, well deserved by the way.

74
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,060
If you haven't seen it, it really is delightful. It's not a traditional math lesson in the sense

75
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,380
of explaining some topic that you might need to learn for a course, or even one that exists in

76
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,200
a clear field for that matter, but it absolutely captures the spirit of mathematical discovery.

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,600
The question posed in the video seems a little bit silly at first, which is what's the most

78
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,340
complicated passcode for those sorts of swipey swipey pattern passcodes that some phones have.

79
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,520
The video opens by making that question rigorous, giving it a solid definition,

80
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,040
and then proceeds with a really engaging story of problem solving that involves very real math

81
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,080
lessons along the way, things about number theory, about induction, about generalizing a result even

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,380
after you've solved a sub problem, definitely take a look. The final pick I have on my list here,

83
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,200
which again is in no particular order, is one that multiple different guest judges singled out

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,000
as being especially good, and also easily underappreciated. The video describes a really

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,180
clever and memorable proof of this cute fact from geometry known as Pick's theorem. And more than

86
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,420
that, the author has some really nice thoughts about the role of different kinds of proofs in

87
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,860
math, thoughts which more students, and for that matter more teachers, would really benefit from

88
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,600
hearing and thinking about. It's no fancier than it needs to be, but the core idea is just so good

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,100
that, to me at least, the video has a lot more staying power than many of the professionally

90
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,860
produced educational videos that I've seen from established channels out there.

91
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,400
So there you go, those are my five picks for this summer of Math Exposition. But the thing is,

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,180
if you had seen the submissions that I have seen, you would agree that choosing just five winners

93
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,800
is ridiculous, to the point of absurdity. Again, you know, the point is not the winners,

94
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,500
the event is about encouraging people to follow through with projects, things about

95
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,920
Math Exposition they might have been thinking about doing, all of that. But just reiterating

96
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,440
that point feels a little bit hollow, because there are at least, I don't know,

97
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,200
twenty in here where I feel like it is a genuine crime not to have chosen them.

98
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,420
And, well you know, it's my contest, my rules, so if you'll indulge me, let me quickly tell you

99
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,740
about some others that I just loved. One that I think viewers of this channel would especially

100
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:11,140
enjoy is almost an hour. It's about Durock's belt trick by Noah Miller. In a recent event that I was

101
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,940
doing with Stephen Strogatz for the MoMath Museum, we had a call that was ostensibly meant to prepare

102
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,580
for that event, but instead we spent much of it just both gushing over how much we liked this one

103
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,380
particular video. Any of you who have flirted with this topic will probably know how tricky it can be

104
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,620
to understand the link between points on a 4D sphere and rotations in 3D space, and why any of

105
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,920
that has to do with quantum mechanics, but this animated hour-long lecture does a really good job

106
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:45,920
laying out the full story. Another one which is long but good is about the unsolvability of the

107
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,380
object. I'm not seeing it because when I did, I was actively working on a video that was not just

108
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,360
about the same theorem, but about the same comparatively esoteric proof that it describes there.

109
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,120
I thought the video did such a wonderful job, I just kind of set aside the project. I'll still probably

110
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,960
cover it at some point, but now I'm motivated to do it in a different way, but in the meantime, any

111
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,120
of you curious about why quintic polynomials are in a certain sense unsolvable will absolutely love

112
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,860
this video. So many entries here were just really solid explainers, plain and simple. This includes

113
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,780
the best overview I've seen of the two-envelope problem, a great explanation for how fonts get

114
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,520
turned into pixels, a wonderful article on spinners, a comic style blog post about E,

115
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,460
a video about an ancient Babylonian algorithm for multiplying numbers, which has unexpected

116
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,300
usefulness for certain programming tasks. There were a number of videos in Chinese on the site

117
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,780
Bilibili, including one I really liked about a fundamental theorem for symmetric polynomials,

118
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,460
perfectly understandable with the English subtitles. And one absolutely fantastic video in

119
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,640
here was about lemur factor stencils, which I had never heard of, and I learned a ton watching this

120
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,100
and found it absolutely fascinating. Many of the entries I saw had excellent aha moments, like this

121
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,340
one here, with a mildly clickbaity title about a graph that will blow your mind, but the thing is,

122
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,860
at least in my experience, that title is 100% accurate. There's a video explaining why pi shows

123
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,440
up in the Buffon needle problem with a really elegant shift in perspective, and what I especially

124
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,640
appreciate is that the author also has an appendix video going through some of the more technical

125
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
details not covered in the main video. A few entries were highly interesting if for no other

126
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,480
reason just from a technological standpoint alone, including a very well-executed interactive video by

127
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,740
Rob Schlubb, which let me tell you is not easy to pull off, as well as a great interactive article

128
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,560
introducing complex numbers and the fundamental theorem of algebra on the site Trina. And then

129
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,100
setting aside all the explanatory value, we're just plain beautiful. Like if I had a category

130
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,360
here for greatest style, I think my pick would be this one about recreating curves from a children's

131
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,240
toy. But setting aside style or the core point of all of this, which is the explanatory quality,

132
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,060
there's one feature of online explainers that can easily be underappreciated, which is the role of

133
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,260
narrative and storylines. And a couple entries I think did a great job exemplifying that component.

134
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,520
This includes not one but two entries on this game called Hackenbush, a story about how a

135
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,860
lights-out puzzle can lead you to Gaussian elimination, a nice exploration of the most

136
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,760
efficient way to choose a random point in a circle uniformly, a great puzzle about tiles,

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,640
which carries with it explanations of core facts from Fibonacci numbers, and one really nicely done

138
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,180
video about why the Sierpinski triangle shows up in three seemingly completely unrelated contexts.

139
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,760
Again, the list goes on for quite a while. As I look at some of these now, I'm really pleased

140
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,900
to see that a lot of them have picked up some traction on YouTube, but there still remain many

141
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,200
which are very underappreciated. I highly encourage you to go to the playlist including all the video

142
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,880
submissions and to check out the blog post featuring all other submissions. As you look

143
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,920
at that playlist, I would not read into the order of it too much, it was generated programmatically,

144
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,900
but I did try to go through and curate the first few ones with videos that I think you might

145
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,340
especially like. Honestly though, you can happily scroll down that playlist and find hidden gems
