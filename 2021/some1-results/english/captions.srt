00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,002
This summer, James Schloss and I ran a contest that's meant to encourage more people 

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:08,100
to make online math explainers, and here I want to share with you some of my favorites.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,928
I wrote up a much fuller blog post about the event and the process for selecting winners, 

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:15,120
but let's open here with some of the key points.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,000
First of all, it was extremely open-ended.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,239
It's meant for math explainers of any kind, any medium, 

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,120
any target audience, any topic, pretty much just as long as it's about math.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,474
The promise was to select around 4-5 to be winners, 

9
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:31,483
which I would then feature in a video, here we are now, 

10
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:35,351
and after I made the initial announcement, Brilliant came in and kindly 

11
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:37,340
offered cash prizes to those winners.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,448
Before anything, let me just emphasize this notion of a 

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,940
winner should really be taken with a heavy grain of salt.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,386
The spirit of the event, and hopefully this is obvious, 

15
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,792
is to get more people sharing their knowledge, 

16
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,170
and preferably to have them do so in a way that's as engaging and 

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,860
empathetic and novel as possible.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,397
The way I see it, there's some benefits to framing it as a contest, 

19
00:00:57,397 --> 00:01:00,905
like we have a clear deadline, and that can be a great cure for perfectionism 

20
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:01,580
and stagnation.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,735
Also, having some small stakes involved hopefully means that the lessons are 

22
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:09,362
put together with a little bit more care, and with a little bit more attention 

23
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:12,760
to the kind of principles that I wanted to emphasize with the whole event.

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,173
The downside, which is not to be taken lightly, 

25
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:21,020
is that it gives the false impression that success looks like winning, but it does not.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,824
Success means having more material out there that 

27
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,180
explains math and inspires people to engage with it.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,903
Ten years from now, no one is going to remember my arbitrary selections, 

29
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:33,975
but every one of the pieces made will still exist and will still potentially help someone 

30
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:34,700
trying to learn.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,474
We received over 1200 submissions, and as a first pass for the 

32
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,821
judgment we had a peer review process to help filter that down to 

33
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,320
a little over 100 that James and I could give a really close look at.

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,763
We also had around half a dozen guest judges, people in the space of math exposition, 

35
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:51,900
to help us narrow down those final judgments.

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,446
Many, many thanks to those guests for being willing to volunteer some of their time, 

37
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:59,464
and generally helping to ensure that any of my subjective quirks 

38
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:01,740
weren't leaking too much into the final decision.

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,540
Also, a million thanks to James.

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,437
He really was the core organizer behind everything here, 

41
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:10,063
and if you participated in the event and found it helpful, 

42
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,200
he is absolutely the one you should be thanking.

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,147
As I said, there's a blog post with more details for any of you who are curious, 

44
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:20,876
but right now, without further ado, let me tell you about some outstanding 

45
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,760
math explainers that I really think you're going to enjoy.

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,437
This entry, from a channel called Paralogical, 

47
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:31,921
opens by asking why the light reflected at the bottom of a mug seems to form 

48
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,960
this characteristic cardioid shape.

49
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,675
The core mathematical idea that this video teaches is that of envelopes, 

50
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:42,709
which in short is a way to describe one curve using a family of other curves, 

51
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,364
and what really makes the video special is not just how clearly he explains that subject, 

52
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:50,002
but how tangible and well-chosen the examples are, 

53
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:54,140
all delivered with a tone that's just plain friendly and enjoyable to listen to.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,287
The key formula he builds up to is really well motivated, 

55
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:01,226
and one of those things that would not be obvious if you just saw it out of context, 

56
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:04,748
and he gives the tools for any curious viewer to pause and work through for 

57
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:08,409
themselves a more detailed understanding, while still leaving room for someone 

58
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,069
watching to get the general idea and the core points without necessarily being 

59
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,460
bogged down into that algebra.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,394
On the topic of fun ways that light gets redirected, 

61
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:22,140
another one of my picks is an absolutely mind-blowing piece of engineering wizardry.

62
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,361
This one is a blog post written by Matt Ferraro, 

63
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,200
where he explains how he made this acrylic square.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,763
It might look innocent at first, like nothing more than a transparent square, 

65
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:37,074
maybe suspiciously wavy, but when you look at its shadow you can see that it's been 

66
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:41,540
carefully crafted to redirect light in such a way as to form a highly deliberate image.

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,574
The post walks through all of the math and the algorithms involved in pulling this off, 

68
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:49,877
including certain false starts in the discovery process, which I love, 

69
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:53,412
and the author skillfully draws the reader's attention to which details are 

70
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:57,600
important and deserve more of your focus, and which ones are more side notes and minutiae.

71
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,351
I found myself a little surprised about what parts of the process 

72
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:03,483
turned out to be hard and which ones were easy, 

73
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:06,548
and by the end the whole task felt a lot less mysterious while still 

74
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:09,791
commanding no shortage of respect for the fact that someone was actually 

75
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,680
able to pull it off.

76
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,044
The next pick that I have on my list here, I'll feel a little torn about, 

77
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:19,740
I wouldn't be surprised if many of you have already seen this video, 

78
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,740
it's called The Beauty of BÃ©zier Curves by Freya Homare.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,217
Given the spirit of the contest, which is to encourage people to share their knowledge 

80
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:32,573
without necessarily getting intimidated by a need for high production quality, you know, 

81
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:36,439
focus on the quality of the lesson more so than the medium used to express it, 

82
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,794
this video was so beautifully produced I almost felt like choosing it risked sending the 

83
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:41,480
wrong message.

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,619
Also, part of the goal here is to shine a light on comparatively unknown creators, 

85
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,240
and by the time I was watching this one it had around 400,000 views.

86
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,884
But the thing is, Freya's video really is a fantastic piece of exposition, 

87
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:58,904
and it would be a little bit silly of me to fault it for also being beautiful 

88
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:02,460
and evidently also being appreciated by many people in both respects.

89
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,556
I do want to be clear, the reason that I'm choosing it is not because of the smooth 

90
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:12,035
graphics, it's that here we have someone who uses a certain mathematical tool regularly 

91
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:16,210
in her work, and she has the ability to clearly motivate why you should care too, 

92
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,791
and to go into the details of how it works, the many different facets of how she uses it, 

93
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:25,271
how she thinks about it, and what makes it visually great is not so much the smoothness 

94
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:29,496
of the graphics or the aesthetic appeal, it's that they're clean and to the point, 

95
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,398
serving to aid what's the core value in the whole piece, 

96
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,725
a series of well-chosen intuitions and applications of a topic in math that deserves 

97
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,100
to be known by more people.

98
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,625
After that one I really did think that with my other picks I could 

99
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,830
help direct the audience of this channel to some excellent lessons 

100
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,940
that you might not have seen yet, like with the next one I chose.

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,022
When I saw it, it had a couple hundred views and I really 

102
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,500
loved it and I was excited to share it with you all.

103
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,556
But then it looks like the internet kind of beat me to it, 

104
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:01,140
this thing is quickly going on a million views, well deserved by the way.

105
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,760
If you haven't seen it, it really is delightful.

106
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,791
It's not a traditional math lesson in the sense of explaining some topic that 

107
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,449
you might need to learn for a course, or even one that exists in a clear field 

108
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,200
for that matter, but it absolutely captures the spirit of mathematical discovery.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,927
The question posed in the video seems a little bit silly at first, 

110
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,747
which is what's the most complicated passcode for those sorts 

111
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,340
of swipey swipey pattern passcodes that some phones have.

112
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,536
The video opens by making that question rigorous, giving it a solid definition, 

113
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:32,995
and then proceeds with a really engaging story of problem solving that involves very 

114
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:37,086
real math lessons along the way, things about number theory, about induction, 

115
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:40,653
about generalizing a result even after you've solved a sub problem, 

116
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:41,860
definitely take a look.

117
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,838
The final pick I have on my list here, which again is in no particular order, 

118
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:51,232
is one that multiple different guest judges singled out as being especially good, 

119
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,000
and also easily underappreciated.

120
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,320
The video describes a really clever and memorable proof 

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,000
of this cute fact from geometry known as Pick's theorem.

122
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,081
And more than that, the author has some really nice thoughts about the role 

123
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,071
of different kinds of proofs in math, thoughts which more students, 

124
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:09,940
and for that matter more teachers, would really benefit from hearing and thinking about.

125
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,389
It's no fancier than it needs to be, but the core idea is just so good that, 

126
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,828
to me at least, the video has a lot more staying power than many of the professionally 

127
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:22,860
produced educational videos that I've seen from established channels out there.

128
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,960
So there you go, those are my five picks for this summer of Math Exposition.

129
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,980
But the thing is, if you had seen the submissions that I have seen, 

130
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,300
you would agree that choosing just five winners is ridiculous, to the point of absurdity.

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,031
Again, you know, the point is not the winners, 

132
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,948
the event is about encouraging people to follow through with projects, 

133
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:45,400
things about Math Exposition they might have been thinking about doing, all of that.

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,343
But just reiterating that point feels a little bit hollow, because there are at least, 

135
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:54,938
I don't know, twenty in here where I feel like it is a genuine crime not to have chosen 

136
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:55,200
them.

137
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,180
And, well you know, it's my contest, my rules, so if you'll indulge me, 

138
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,980
let me quickly tell you about some others that I just loved.

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
One that I think viewers of this channel would especially enjoy is almost an hour.

140
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,400
It's about Durock's belt trick by Noah Miller.

141
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,800
In a recent event that I was doing with Stephen Strogatz for the MoMath Museum, 

142
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,900
we had a call that was ostensibly meant to prepare for that event, 

143
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,693
but instead we spent much of it just both gushing over how much we liked this one 

144
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,480
particular video.

145
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,866
Any of you who have flirted with this topic will probably know how tricky 

146
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:30,666
it can be to understand the link between points on a 4D sphere and rotations in 3D space, 

147
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,546
and why any of that has to do with quantum mechanics, 

148
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:38,080
but this animated hour-long lecture does a really good job laying out the full story.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,160
Another one which is long but good is about the unsolvability of the object.

150
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,177
I'm not seeing it because when I did, I was actively working 

151
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,798
on a video that was not just about the same theorem, 

152
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,360
but about the same comparatively esoteric proof that it describes there.

153
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
I thought the video did such a wonderful job, I just kind of set aside the project.

154
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,288
I'll still probably cover it at some point, but now I'm motivated to do it in 

155
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:06,911
a different way, but in the meantime, any of you curious about why quintic 

156
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:10,680
polynomials are in a certain sense unsolvable will absolutely love this video.

157
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,900
So many entries here were just really solid explainers, plain and simple.

158
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,068
This includes the best overview I've seen of the two-envelope problem, 

159
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,081
a great explanation for how fonts get turned into pixels, 

160
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,510
a wonderful article on spinners, a comic style blog post about E, 

161
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,199
a video about an ancient Babylonian algorithm for multiplying numbers, 

162
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,420
which has unexpected usefulness for certain programming tasks.

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,160
There were a number of videos in Chinese on the site Bilibili, 

164
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,841
including one I really liked about a fundamental theorem for symmetric polynomials, 

165
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,120
perfectly understandable with the English subtitles.

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,414
And one absolutely fantastic video in here was about lemur factor stencils, 

167
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:51,754
which I had never heard of, and I learned a ton watching this and found it absolutely 

168
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:52,360
fascinating.

169
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,650
Many of the entries I saw had excellent aha moments, like this one here, 

170
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,609
with a mildly clickbaity title about a graph that will blow your mind, 

171
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:05,680
but the thing is, at least in my experience, that title is 100% accurate.

172
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,172
There's a video explaining why pi shows up in the Buffon needle 

173
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,507
problem with a really elegant shift in perspective, 

174
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:14,380
and what I especially appreciate is that the author also has an 

175
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,432
appendix video going through some of the more technical details not 

176
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,600
covered in the main video.

177
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,589
A few entries were highly interesting if for no other reason just from a technological 

178
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,834
standpoint alone, including a very well-executed interactive video by Rob Schlubb, 

179
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,238
which let me tell you is not easy to pull off, 

180
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:34,687
as well as a great interactive article introducing complex numbers and the fundamental 

181
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,580
theorem of algebra on the site Trina.

182
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,620
And then setting aside all the explanatory value, we're just plain beautiful.

183
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,612
Like if I had a category here for greatest style, 

184
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:48,600
I think my pick would be this one about recreating curves from a children's toy.

185
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,154
But setting aside style or the core point of all of this, 

186
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,612
which is the explanatory quality, there's one feature of online explainers 

187
00:10:56,612 --> 00:11:00,440
that can easily be underappreciated, which is the role of narrative and storylines.

188
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,260
And a couple entries I think did a great job exemplifying that component.

189
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,620
This includes not one but two entries on this game called Hackenbush, 

190
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,768
a story about how a lights-out puzzle can lead you to Gaussian elimination, 

191
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:16,862
a nice exploration of the most efficient way to choose a random point in a 

192
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:21,283
circle uniformly, a great puzzle about tiles, which carries with it explanations 

193
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:25,486
of core facts from Fibonacci numbers, and one really nicely done video about 

194
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:30,180
why the Sierpinski triangle shows up in three seemingly completely unrelated contexts.

195
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,720
Again, the list goes on for quite a while.

196
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,520
As I look at some of these now, I'm really pleased to see that a lot of them have picked 

197
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,400
up some traction on YouTube, but there still remain many which are very underappreciated.

198
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,149
I highly encourage you to go to the playlist including all the video 

199
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,660
submissions and to check out the blog post featuring all other submissions.

200
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,740
As you look at that playlist, I would not read into the order of it too much, 

201
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,833
it was generated programmatically, but I did try to go through and curate 

202
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,760
the first few ones with videos that I think you might especially like.

203
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,256
Honestly though, you can happily scroll down that 

204
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:03,000
playlist and find hidden gems all throughout.

205
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,580
Like really, go check it out right now.

206
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,265
If you do, I can almost guarantee that you have hours of edification 

207
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:12,480
waiting ahead of you, not to mention hours of just pure delight.

208
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,200
Thanks again to everyone who participated.

209
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,540
Let me just say one more time, I really was blown away by the quality here.
