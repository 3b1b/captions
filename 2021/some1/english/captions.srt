1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,601
I want to tell you about a contest that I'm running with a friend of mine, 

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,674
James Schloss, who some of you might recognize from the YouTube 

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,460
channel LeosOS and his Twitch stream and things like that.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
Also, now there's a 3b1b podcast, but more on that in just a moment.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,939
Basically, we want there to be more math explanation online, 

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,680
and we want to encourage more people to get started actually doing it.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,648
We're calling it the Summer of Math Exposition, 

8
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:30,952
where essentially we're just inviting anyone who wants to to submit some kind 

9
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:35,090
of math explainer, whether that's a video or a blog post or an interactive 

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,511
game or whatever it is that explains math online in some way, 

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,160
to the link that's on screen now by August 22nd.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,960
And then once we...

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Yes, I see you.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,200
Would you like to sniff at the microphone?

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,620
Oh yes, that's very sweet.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,300
Very sweet.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,960
You're a very affectionate creature.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,800
All right, where was I?

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,034
Anyway, after August 22nd, we're going to have a selection process to choose 

20
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:05,840
some winners from among them, and then I'll feature them in a 3b1b video.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,509
And then for the rest, I'll probably also put together a playlist of all of the 

22
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,880
videos and a list of links on the website somewhere to all the project submissions.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,784
And then I was also thinking maybe I would send something to the winners, 

24
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:20,220
like creating some custom gold plushie pie creatures or something like that.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,514
But the main prize is to have your work featured 

26
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,500
and hopefully get it out to a few more people.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,920
The reason I'm interested in doing this is I think there's a lot of people out there who 

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,663
would be really good at doing this, would have some excellent explanation that would 

29
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:36,319
genuinely help a lot of people or show a topic that's not really covered very well 

30
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,760
elsewhere.

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,100
And who might even be thinking about doing it.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,006
You know, there's that back of your mind spot that says maybe one 

33
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,940
day I'll try my hand at a video or just write this up as a blog post.

34
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,880
But you just never really got around to it.

35
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,860
You know, life's busy.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,420
You're not sure where to start.

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,460
It seems like there's a lot of other things out there.

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,470
And my hope is that by dangling the tiniest carrot that I can provide, 

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,320
just mentioning good work when it exists, then maybe that gets a couple more 

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,520
people over this hump who might otherwise not have made something and then actually 

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:03,920
make it.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,004
So one of the very few constraints on entries for this 

43
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:09,680
particular contest is that it has to be something new.

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,316
It can't be a thing that you made a while ago and you're just submitting 

45
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:16,840
a link to it now, but something that you make between now and August 22nd.

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,795
And the real spirit of this all is to encourage people 

47
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:23,020
who have never tried it before to get started in it somehow.

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,475
The other constraint is that it does have to be about math, 

49
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:28,880
but math in the broadest possible sense of the term.

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,673
So that could include physics or computer science, 

51
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:34,040
as long as it's got some mathy components to it.

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,858
So if you're doing physics and there's formulas that are relevant, 

53
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:38,300
don't shy away from those formulas.

54
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,764
Or if you're doing some computer science and there's some, you know, 

55
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:44,316
algorithmic complexity or something mathematical to it, 

56
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,140
try to lean into that a little bit more.

57
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,420
Other than that, the topic matter is completely up to you.

58
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,866
So maybe you have some topics that you've seen or that you've learned about, 

59
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,280
but what you really feel aren't covered well online anywhere.

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,720
And it would really be adding something new to the space.

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,666
Maybe you're a physics buff who is interested in the philosophical side of things, 

62
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,071
and you've learned about Conway's freewheel theorem, 

63
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:07,248
and you want to talk about it and whether that's an appropriate name, 

64
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,880
whether it's actually philosophically interesting or not, 

65
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,560
or just share with people what it is.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,224
Or maybe you're someone who's into information theory and things like that, 

67
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:18,465
and you've learned about how Kolmogorov complexity can be used to describe 

68
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,496
some things about the distributions of primes, 

69
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:23,608
and you think that's actually an interesting angle for how to introduce 

70
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,380
Kolmogorov complexity in the first place.

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,510
Or anything like this where it's something kind of new to the space, 

72
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,980
if that's you, you should definitely consider submitting.

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,004
But it doesn't have to be a topic that no one has 

74
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,320
ever covered or that's severely under covered online.

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,069
Even if it's something that's very standard, and especially if it's something 

76
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,395
that a lot of students have to reach at some point, 

77
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:45,660
coming up with a better way to explain it, kind of thinking about what's 

78
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,255
the state-of-the-art explanation on any particular thing, 

79
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,000
that could also add a lot to the space.

80
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,210
Say for example you've taught students about partial fraction decomposition and tutoring 

81
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,592
or teaching or something like that, and you feel like you've come across a way of 

82
00:03:57,592 --> 00:04:01,140
explaining it that makes it a little bit more memorable, you should definitely submit.

83
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,894
Or maybe you have some really pretty way to visualize certain trig 

84
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:08,267
identities that students run into that keeps them from very rote and 

85
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:12,080
instead sheds a light on how beautiful math can be and all that kind of thing.

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,880
If that's you and you feel passionate about it, you should definitely submit that.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,329
One set of people who I'm particularly interested in for this competition 

88
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,907
are the teachers and the lecturers, and basically anyone with a lot of 

89
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:28,040
boots-to-the-ground experience seeing people learn and seeing what actually works.

90
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,621
Because I think there's a lot of outstanding explanations out there that stay 

91
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,876
largely confined to the classroom or otherwise stay offline, 

92
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:40,091
whereas if just a little bit of effort was put into producing it or sharing it 

93
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:44,626
online in some way, those lessons might actually reach and benefit one to two orders 

94
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:45,960
of magnitude more people.

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,723
And I get it, teachers are absurdly busy, they don't have time for extra 

96
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,840
things on the side, and it's kind of hard to know where to get started.

97
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,807
So maybe one potential partnership here would be the teachers who have really good 

98
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:02,049
instincts for what works in education, and then a student who maybe has a lot of 

99
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:06,240
energy or desire to get started on YouTube or otherwise just has more free time 

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,640
and pairing something together like that might actually make for a good partnership.

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,205
In either case, whatever category you fall into, 

102
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:16,329
I do know there's a lot of people who do want to get started with this, 

103
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,973
because they write to me a lot, and one of the most common sentiments out there is, 

104
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:23,747
well I don't know where to get started, I want to make a video but I don't really have 

105
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,960
any experience with video making, things like that.

106
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,980
And I have a couple things to say for who feels like they're in that boat.

107
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,955
In a kind of loose conjunction with this contest, 

108
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:40,744
I decided to start a podcast where for the first many conversations I'll 

109
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:44,482
be interviewing people who have some kind of experience in the space of 

110
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:45,780
putting out explanations.

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,198
So that could be other YouTubers, but it could also include mathematicians 

112
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:53,819
who are really engaged with outreach, or the founder of Khan Academy, 

113
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,646
like this, and essentially have conversations which act to either inspire 

114
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:01,060
or otherwise inform anyone who might be getting started with this.

115
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,096
After doing several of these interviews, one of the most useful pieces 

116
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:08,672
of information that I think comes out from them is just how ramshackle 

117
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:12,400
and unprofessional the setup for a lot of people is in the very beginning.

118
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,215
And as a result, it should come as no surprise that one of the most common 

119
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,777
pieces of advice, one of the most universal answers to the question of what 

120
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:23,340
advice would you give to someone getting started with this is to just start.

121
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,400
The things that differentiate the people who actually put stuff out there versus 

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,180
the ones who don't is not a matter of having a lot more experience with it beforehand.

123
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,560
It's a matter of having a kind of generative spirit that just wants to make stuff.

124
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,168
Because my, I say persona, but this is, you know, 

125
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,800
me, this is genuinely me is give it a go.

126
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,840
You're probably going to fail, but it's worth a try.

127
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,240
I get a lot of people kind of saying, oh, like you make YouTube videos.

128
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,580
I've always wanted to make YouTube videos.

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,740
And I'm like, great, just do it.

130
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,880
And they're like, no, no, but I need to buy a nice camera and I need to get a good set.

131
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,460
And I'm like, no, no, no, like, just do it.

132
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,500
There's always this temptation.

133
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,400
Wait, am I ready yet?

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,000
Am I ready yet?

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,220
And I just say, Sal, press record and start, see what happens.

136
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,813
If I take the example, which I know best, which is my own, 

137
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:10,493
there are so many really embarrassing things about the early videos on this channel or 

138
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:12,000
my process in creating them.

139
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,340
I mean, the sound quality was pretty terrible for a long time is one big thing.

140
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,980
I edited in iMovie for way longer than I care to admit.

141
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,788
Also, despite being now a like professional YouTuber, 

142
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:28,306
when it comes to cameras and actually filming things like this, 

143
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:30,340
I really have no idea what I'm doing.

144
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,040
Like right now, I'm just using a phone, which I guess is fine.

145
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,307
I find the process of being alone in a room and 

146
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,900
just talking to a camera incredibly awkward.

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,443
This is actually my second time recording this whole video because the first time 

148
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:47,131
I thought I had a phone, I thought I would be really clever and have some notes to 

149
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:50,820
like guide what I wanted to say and I'd put them on the monitor next to the camera.

150
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,608
But what the result was is that I would just kind of have my eyes 

151
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,140
darting back and forth between the two without me consciously realizing it.

152
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,740
It was just this reminder that I really don't know what I'm doing.

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,180
But this isn't a self-effacing thing.

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,948
The point here is that if you find yourself with a potentially good 

155
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:10,596
explainer that you want to make, but you're a little self-conscious 

156
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:14,620
about how to start or you're just don't worry about it, just dive right in.

157
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,620
So many of us have no idea what we're doing when we begin.

158
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,121
All that said, sometimes this just do it advice is a 

159
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:27,560
little bit frustrating because I mean it's not actionable.

160
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,640
You say okay I'm gonna start, but then upon starting it tells you nothing.

161
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,428
So in the spirit of some more concrete advice, 

162
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:37,902
I do have a couple things that I might want to pass along that are specific 

163
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:39,320
to the case of math explainers.

164
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,580
The first one, and I do actually find this quite important, 

165
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,415
is when you're putting together the explanation, whatever form, whatever medium, 

166
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:50,251
whatever genre you choose, try to be aware of the layers of abstraction that are 

167
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:51,340
relevant to your topic.

168
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,366
So like if you're teaching a young child about fractions and 

169
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,370
you're talking about two-thirds plus one-fifth, 

170
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,460
there's two different layers of abstraction that that expression lives in.

171
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,058
There's one where you have a very concrete example of two-thirds of something, 

172
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,321
two-thirds of a cake, and then one-fifth of a cake, 

173
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:07,280
and trying to get a sense of what that means.

174
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,195
And then there's the symbols, and a big part of the lesson at play here 

175
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,820
is understanding how the symbols relate to the actual case and why the 

176
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,700
rules that we apply to the symbols make sense in light of the concrete case.

177
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,923
And also why we opt to do the more abstract thing because it takes much less thinking 

178
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:26,873
than actually trying to reason about you know two-thirds of a cake plus one-fifth of a 

179
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:27,100
cake.

180
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,220
And this happens at all levels.

181
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,795
If you're teaching a calculus class and you're talking about optimizing functions, 

182
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:36,198
you know there's the idea of a function as a very abstract thing that could be 

183
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:39,300
any particular function or any differentiable function or what have you.

184
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,480
And then there's lots of specific examples or maybe specific cases where they come up 

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,084
like a function defining the profit of a company and that's the thing you want to 

186
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:47,480
optimize.

187
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,888
I made a whole video about group theory where in the middle I went on 

188
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:55,136
for a while about the difference between thinking of group actions as 

189
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,291
these abstract entities versus as something concrete like asymmetry 

190
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,540
and why there exists the two and what the benefits and trade-offs are.

191
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,902
But my point in this first piece of advice is not merely to address the layers 

192
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:10,006
of abstraction, you don't even have to, but if you're clear in your own head try 

193
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:14,060
very hard to structure your explanation to go from the concrete to the abstract.

194
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,407
I think almost always when you understand something 

195
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:20,240
the natural inclination is to go the other way around.

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,960
I find myself doing this in pretty much any first draft of a script that I have.

197
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,280
It seems like all the textbook authors that I ever read tend to do this.

198
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,237
You start with the abstract idea, you put the examples later, 

199
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:34,001
but I really do think that in the case of learning first trying to populate the 

200
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:37,671
learner's mind with a bunch of examples of things that have a similar pattern 

201
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,353
between them and letting their brain do the abstraction, 

202
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:44,118
see that similar pattern between things such that when you bring in that higher 

203
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:47,882
layer you start defining you know an abstract vector space or you're doing some 

204
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:50,000
symbolic manipulations with particular rules.

205
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,286
That once that happens you're articulating something in the brain of the learner that 

206
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,120
was already sitting there in the first place, it wasn't just handed to them in a vacuum.

207
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,240
Otherwise it's a little bit like trying to build a building from the top floor down.

208
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,840
So that's one and that's very specific to math.

209
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,075
As a more generic idea, piece of advice number two would be keep in the very 

210
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,695
forefront of your mind the fact that content is king, 

211
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:15,431
that the thing that you're explaining, the choice of the topic or how you're 

212
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:19,069
explaining it, determines the majority of the value and the quality of the 

213
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,040
thing that you make.

214
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,646
All the things about production quality or you know how fancy the animations are 

215
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:29,066
or the lighting or whatever it is, all of that is secondary to making sure you've 

216
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:33,540
chosen an actually good topic and it's something that people would want to consume.

217
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,840
They haven't seen it elsewhere, it's offering something fresh.

218
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,708
Now that's so easy to nod along with and say like yes yes of course content is king, 

219
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,190
but the thing is you end up spending about one percent of your time if 

220
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,868
that choosing what you're going to explain and how you're going to explain 

221
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:51,448
it and then like 99% of the time just carrying it out in some way and as 

222
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:54,440
a result it can be easy to lose sight of that important part.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,557
So my encouragement to you would be spend more time 

224
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:00,440
than you would otherwise tend to on choosing that topic.

225
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,893
So maybe workshop a couple different things by doing sample lessons with 

226
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:06,883
people or try to write out a list of all the different things that you 

227
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:10,588
could and ask are they actually fresh, are they actually adding something to the space, 

228
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:12,820
is there a reason someone would want to consume this.

229
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,958
Spending that extra little bit of time on the thing that 

230
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,060
determines the majority of the value is almost certainly worth it.

231
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,693
And the third piece of advice which maybe plays into this a little bit is when you're 

232
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:27,730
beginning if you're starting something fresh and there's no presence online at this 

233
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,055
point, try to choose something much more esoteric and specific than you might be inclined 

234
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:32,200
to.

235
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,448
I've seen a lot of people who want to get started on YouTube for example and the way 

236
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:40,120
that they try to go about it is to choose a topic that will appeal to the most people.

237
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,267
After all they want their video to blow up, they 

238
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,020
want a lot of subscribers and things like that.

239
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,920
But there's a couple issues with this.

240
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,942
First of all it's a much more competitive space if you're going to 

241
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,620
try to describe something that a lot of people might be searching for.

242
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,008
So if you go in saying I'm going to do a series about quantum mechanics, 

243
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,104
well there's a billion others out there and yours is going to have to 

244
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:01,200
stand out for some reason and you don't have a foothold at that point.

245
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,787
But another one is that the very specific and niche things build a much more loyal 

246
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:09,863
audience in that beginning because you're offering something which they could not find 

247
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:13,797
anywhere else and sometimes to be the consumer of something very specific is such a 

248
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:17,920
good feeling that you want to pay it back and you find yourself rooting for the creator.

249
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,320
So you're more likely to get very good faith feedback, just a warmer community.

250
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,640
And also oftentimes we tend to overestimate just how niche things are.

251
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,763
Like sometimes something that's so weirdly specific, 

252
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:34,904
some very esoteric bit of engineering actually appeals to hundreds of thousands 

253
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:39,045
or millions of people, especially if you yourself are enthusiastic about it and 

254
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:40,340
people can index on that.

255
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,598
So by doing that you find yourself often with a topic that actually does have 

256
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:48,486
a broader appeal but it's not competitive with the things that everyone thinks 

257
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:51,980
will have broader appeal and you potentially get that audience loyalty.

258
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,717
When I started this channel I really was thinking of it as a very niche thing, 

259
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:58,600
I did not think it would be a thing that a lot of people would want to watch.

260
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,768
I actually specifically wanted to find topics in math that no one would think to search 

261
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:06,520
for, that was kind of the original conception that I wavered from a little bit afterward.

262
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,660
The fourth piece of advice is to pick a genre that your piece falls into.

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,593
So the other day I was giving this talk to a group of people and one 

264
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:18,935
of them wanted to get started making online explainers and they asked 

265
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:22,324
whether it was ethical for someone who's just barely learning a topic, 

266
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:25,380
just starting to learn it, to also make explainers of it online.

267
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,137
I mean after all they're more likely to make mistakes, 

268
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,870
they don't know the broader context, and there's so many things I like 

269
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,640
about that question.

270
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,630
It's already demonstrating a kind of care and consideration for factual accuracy and 

271
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,274
doing right by the student that more people who are making online explanations should 

272
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:41,760
consider.

273
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,100
So that very fact suggested to me that this person probably should be doing it.

274
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,935
But one of the things I suggested is to acknowledge 

275
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,200
there are different types of explainers out there.

276
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,534
There's the type where the narrator is a little bit more distanced, 

277
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:58,241
they're kind of standing on top of a hill and explaining the way that things are, 

278
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,180
and to do that you really have to research the topic very deeply.

279
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,140
You should probably know 10 times as much about the topic as what you're actually 

280
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,894
saying in the content so that you know that you're teeing things up for where it 

281
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:13,020
actually leads or you're being cognizant of whatever nuances there are, things like that.

282
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,532
But another genre entirely is the discovery journalism, 

283
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:20,867
where the person who is learning the topic kind of just admits that fact or is 

284
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:25,093
open about the fact that they're just starting with it and taking the viewer 

285
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:26,520
along a journey with them.

286
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,645
And many times that's actually a better piece of content, 

287
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,563
it's actually better for learning the topic, and it comes with 

288
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:35,620
this inbuilt piece of humility that a lot of online content lacks.

289
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,660
But there's lots of other genres like this.

290
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,698
There's the worked example where you're explicitly helping people with homework, 

291
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,248
there's the try to find an interesting demo and serve mainly to inspire, 

292
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:49,624
and basically just before you get started, decide which one of those you feel like you're 

293
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:53,223
the best fit for, and then when you're looking at other pieces out there, 

294
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:57,015
other explainers and trying to index off of what seems to work, what doesn't, 

295
00:15:57,015 --> 00:16:01,197
be aware of which ones are in the lane that you intend to be in and don't necessarily 

296
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:03,240
pattern match off of the ones that aren't.

297
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,447
You know, one of the mistakes I think I made with my very first video is I 

298
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:10,966
had this conception that sometimes if you talk faster than is comfortable on 

299
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:14,440
the internet, that sort of works, that's like a satisfying thing to consume.

300
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,488
Because there are videos out there that are this fire hose of information, 

301
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:21,866
and something about that scratches a niche and I think people like it, 

302
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:26,100
but what I didn't really appreciate was the fact that math should fall into a completely 

303
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,480
different category than that.

304
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,637
It is not fun at all to have math come at you at this fire hose rate, 

305
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:34,186
and basically I was just pattern matching off of things that I should not have been 

306
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:35,200
pattern matching off of.

307
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,931
As point number five, or I don't actually know where I am at the list at this point, 

308
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:43,800
especially in the case of math, if you're bringing up definitions of things, 

309
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,760
try not to let them feel too arbitrary.

310
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,540
Try to let them be well motivated.

311
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
Explain why that's the definition, what else it could have been.

312
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,412
Try to make it something that the learner feels like they discovered themselves, 

313
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:58,091
because too often we hand these things down on high as the starting point, 

314
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,740
and it's not really clear why or where that came from.

315
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,040
So all of that is just on the content side, you know, 

316
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,995
what exactly are you explaining independent of the multimedia component of it, you know, 

317
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,640
the sound and the video and all that.

318
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,371
And like I said, content is king, that definitely determines the majority of quality, 

319
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:17,655
but it does actually matter a little bit beyond that to have at 

320
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:20,220
least a little bit of production quality, I think.

321
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,880
And I'll give a really good example.

322
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,951
So I was watching this lecture the other day by Tadashi Tokieda on just a 

323
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:30,146
really interesting set of ideas about applying physical intuition to solving 

324
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:34,232
math problems, and he had in there maybe seven or eight outstanding little 

325
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:38,100
arguments that could have been just a beautiful video in its own right.

326
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,804
But the talk was over Zoom, and the intro was really long, 

327
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:45,076
and the sound quality is everything that you assume from Zoom, 

328
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:48,660
and the lighting of his shot was weird, and the talk was really good.

329
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,546
And I do think, you know, it's great that it's online and a lot of people will be 

330
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:55,934
consuming it, but it's probably fair to say that if all of that content, 

331
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,904
the actual set of ideas, was instead, say, a Numberphile video, 

332
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:01,040
it would reach a hundred times as many people.

333
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,040
And more than that, it would be a more pleasant experience for those who are consuming it.

334
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,900
And it really doesn't take that much.

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
So I'll just end with a couple pieces of advice on that front.

336
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,142
The first one, which again I acknowledge is very hypocritical here, 

337
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:18,387
is sound quality actually matters, especially in an era of Zoom where we are all 

338
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:22,578
inundated with this sort of sub-optimal version of the voices of all the people 

339
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:23,260
in our lives.

340
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,912
The learner will appreciate a respite from all that with something that 

341
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:30,460
actually comes from a good microphone that you learned how to use at some point.

342
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,066
On the side of visuals, you know, I'm obviously a big believer in the idea that a 

343
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:42,649
well-chosen illustration or an animation can really make a mathematical idea a lot 

344
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:47,341
more clear and be an example of that concretization and kind of going from the lower 

345
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:52,200
layer of abstraction on upward by just showing exactly what it is on screen in some way.

346
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,160
Now the way I do things is with programmatic animations.

347
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,240
I sort of wrote this custom library called Manum to do that.

348
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,369
And last year, actually, a group of people that called themselves the Manum 

349
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,420
Community created a fork of it with the hope of making it a lot more user-friendly.

350
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,840
And I think they succeeded with that.

351
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,120
There's a lot better documentation, it's better tested, just all around friendlier to use.

352
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,691
So you can use that tool and thanks to them, it's 

353
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:16,620
actually a lot easier than it used to be.

354
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,822
There's some other libraries that I've seen that mention Manum as an inspiration, 

355
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:23,460
you know, one that's written in Julia or one in Haskell.

356
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,860
And it doesn't have to be programmatic either.

357
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,476
I think where programmatic animations make sense for math is if you're 

358
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:34,340
somehow leveraging loops or conditionals or layers of abstraction.

359
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,284
And in the right context, I think it can be a wonderful way to let 

360
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:41,549
the visuals authentically reflect the math that you're describing, 

361
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,960
if the code is essentially just that math as it's illustrating things.

362
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,360
But it doesn't have to be.

363
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,505
And a lot of times people use Manum or other programmatic animations for things that do 

364
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:54,642
not need to be programmatic, that you could have easily done in something like Keynote or 

365
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:58,780
which add flashiness for flashiness's sake that doesn't actually aid with the explanation.

366
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,564
I think one really good example of using traditional 

367
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,960
animation software is the channel Boerbach Tree.

368
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,824
So he really has these friendly handwritten kind of whiteboard lectures, 

369
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:13,080
but uses animation to help those whiteboards come alive.

370
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,360
And he uses Adobe Animate for that.

371
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,394
And I think it's a really nice way to make this friendly hand-drawn environment 

372
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:22,722
come to life, which is different from kind of the platonic, stark, 

373
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,746
this is precisely what the math would draw when you're illustrating a surface or 

374
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:27,740
something like that.

375
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,858
Also, I see a lot of people use Manum to manipulate 

376
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,040
algebraic expressions and things like that.

377
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,013
But if you look at other videos, things like Mathologer, 

378
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,760
he's doing a lot of that in PowerPoint.

379
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,740
And again, content is king.

380
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,084
The first thing is to focus on what are you actually describing and then just showing it, 

381
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:47,000
however, is easiest to show it in that case works totally fine.

382
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,444
You don't need anything extremely precise or that 

383
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:51,800
leverages loops and abstraction for the formulas.

384
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,330
I recognize a kind of hypocrisy here, but you know, 

385
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,920
I have walked myself into a certain corner with the style that I want for the channel.

386
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,797
If you do want to go down that hole of programmatic animations, though, 

387
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:06,644
another tool which has popped up recently is something called smoothstep.io, 

388
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:10,392
which I think is a really nice way for people to get started with shaders, 

389
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:13,740
which are an absurdly powerful way to do absurdly beautiful things.

390
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,608
And it's written by this guy, Matt Henderson, who has a Twitter 

391
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,235
account that everyone should follow because he has some of the 

392
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:21,820
most beautiful math illustrations that I think I've ever seen.

393
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,122
So experimenting with software like that is another rabbit hole that you could go down 

394
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:29,487
if, say, you want to use this competition as an excuse to try something new, 

395
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,979
something that you've always wanted to get started with, 

396
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,640
but never really had the excuse to do.

397
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,390
Now, if you have some pieces of advice that you want to pass along to people, 

398
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,415
or if you want to just engage with the community in some way to see what other people 

399
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:45,784
are thinking of making or propose your own project ideas, get feedback, 

400
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:49,856
talk about software, anything like that, we did set up a Discord space associated with 

401
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,260
the Summer of Math Exposition.

402
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
There's a link in the description.

403
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,815
Just be mindful if you do contribute to that community that you want your comments 

404
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:01,820
to be encouraging to others who are getting started and productive to that goal.

405
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
And, you know, try to avoid anything that is the opposite of that goal.

406
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,182
And again, another source of what will hopefully include 

407
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:14,460
some inspirational or informative things will be the podcast.

408
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,260
The first episode is out now.

409
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,278
It's with the mathematician Alex Kontorovich, who some of you may recognize 

410
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,340
from the video he did with Quanta or the video he did with Veritasium on Pi Day.

411
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,020
The episode after that is going to be with Sal Khan.

412
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,680
And there's just a really interesting lineup of people here.

413
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,700
So I think you'll enjoy it.

414
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,740
You can get it wherever you get your podcasts.

415
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,000
There's a video version of it, which is going to live on 

416
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,760
a second channel that is just my name, Grant Sanderson.

417
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,171
And I figure for all future videos that are a little bit like this one, 

418
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:44,165
that's not really animated math, but other stuff, 

419
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:46,080
that's probably the channel that I'll put it on.

420
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,480
So keep an eye on that channel if that's something that you're interested in.

421
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,333
And I will say this about the podcast, even though the original intent 

422
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,487
was something that was very much tied to this competition and the idea 

423
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,753
of targeting people interested in getting started, 

424
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,906
a lot of the times I would find myself with an interesting guest and I 

425
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:05,193
just have a whole bunch of other things that I want to ask them that have 

426
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:06,260
nothing to do with that.

427
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,100
So maybe the better framing here is to say that the podcast is 20% about that goal.

428
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,312
And the other 80% is just the usual interview 

429
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:17,760
style podcast vibe where you have interesting guests.

430
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
And I just want to ask things that I'm genuinely curious to know about them.

431
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,514
And then I get to grad school and I'm moving into my office in grad school and I have my, 

432
00:23:26,514 --> 00:23:30,120
all my old papers and I just started, you know, for fun leafing through them.

433
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,460
I don't know if you ever look back at the stuff you wrote freshman year.

434
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,580
And I look at it, I'm like, what the hell was I writing?

435
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,960
Oh my God, this is garbage.

436
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,540
This is complete.

437
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,180
The epsilons and deltas are backwards.

438
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,400
You can't have the epsilons and deltas be backwards.

439
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,940
And you only took off three points.

440
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,100
I would have taken off, you know, nine or something like Ramy was so nice.

441
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,900
So if lean was around back then, boy, would it have straightened me out.

442
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,091
It's actually very inspiring to me because I feel one of the common pieces 

443
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:59,120
of advice that I'll give to someone if they like want to learn more math.
