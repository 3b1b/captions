00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
I want to tell you about a contest that I'm running with a friend of mine, James Schloss,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
who some of you might recognize from the YouTube channel LeosOS and his Twitch stream and things

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,360
like that. Also, now there's a 3b1b podcast, but more on that in just a moment.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,680
Basically, we want there to be more math explanation online, and we want to encourage

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
more people to get started actually doing it. We're calling it the Summer of Math Exposition,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,360
where essentially we're just inviting anyone who wants to to submit some kind of math explainer,

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,840
whether that's a video or a blog post or an interactive game or whatever it is that

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,000
explains math online in some way, to the link that's on screen now by August 22nd. And then,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,560
once we... Yes, I see you. Would you like to sniff at the microphone? Oh yes, that's very sweet.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Very sweet. You're a very affectionate creature. Alright, where was I? Anyway, after August 22nd,

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,920
we're going to have a selection process to choose some winners from among them, and then I'll

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,640
feature them in a 3b1b video. And then for the rest, I'll probably also put together a playlist

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
of all of the videos and a list of links on the website somewhere to all the project submissions.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
And then I was also thinking maybe I would send something to the winners, like creating some

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
custom gold plushie pie creatures or something like that. But the main prize is to have your

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,160
work featured and hopefully get it out to a few more people. The reason I'm interested in doing

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,040
this is I think there's a lot of people out there who would be really good at doing this, would have

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
some excellent explanation that would genuinely help a lot of people, or show a topic that's not

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
really covered very well elsewhere, and who might even be thinking about doing it. You know, there's

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,920
that back of your mind spot that says, maybe one day I'll try my hand at a video or just write this

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,400
up as a blog post. But you just never really got around to it. You know, life's busy, you're not

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,720
sure where to start, seems like there's a lot of other things out there. And my hope is that by

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,760
dangling the tiniest carrot that I can provide, just mentioning good work when it exists, then

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,400
maybe that gets a couple more people over this hump who might otherwise not have made something

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,080
and then actually make it. So one of the very few constraints on entries for this particular contest

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
is that it has to be something new. It can't be a thing that you made a while ago and you're just

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,040
submitting a link to it now, but something that you make between now and August 22nd.

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,920
And the real spirit of this all is to encourage people who have never tried it before to get

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,120
started in it somehow. The other constraint is that it does have to be about math, but math in

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
the broadest possible sense of the term. So that could include physics or computer science, as long

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
as it's got some mathy components to it. So if you're doing physics and there's formulas that

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
are relevant, don't shy away from those formulas. Or if you're doing some computer science and

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,040
there's some, you know, algorithmic complexity or something mathematical to it, try to lean into

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,080
that a little bit more. Other than that, the topic matter is completely up to you. So maybe

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,600
you have some topics that you've seen or that you've learned about, but what you really feel

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,240
aren't covered well online anywhere. And it would really be adding something new to the space. Maybe

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,040
you're a physics buff who is interested in the philosophical side of things, and you've learned

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,440
about Conway's free will theorem, and you want to talk about it and whether that's an appropriate

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
name, whether it's actually philosophically interesting or not, or just share with people

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,200
what it is. Or maybe you're someone who's into information theory and things like that,

41
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,440
and you've learned about how Kolmogorov complexity can be used to describe some things about the

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,360
distributions of primes, and you think that's actually an interesting angle for how to introduce

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Kolmogorov complexity in the first place. Or anything like this where it's something kind

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,160
of new to the space, if that's you, you should definitely consider submitting. But it doesn't

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,960
have to be a topic that no one has ever covered or that's severely under covered online, even if

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,720
it's something that's very standard, and especially if it's something that a lot of students have to

47
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,000
reach at some point, coming up with a better way to explain it, kind of thinking about what's the

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,880
state-of-the-art explanation on any particular thing, that could also add a lot to the space.

49
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,200
Say, for example, you've taught students about partial fraction decomposition in tutoring or

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,880
teaching or something like that, and you feel like you've come across a way of explaining it that

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,440
makes it a little bit more memorable, you should definitely submit. Or maybe you have some really

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,840
pretty way to visualize certain trig identities that students run into that keeps them from

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,400
writing and instead sheds a light on how beautiful math can be and all that kind of thing.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
If that's you and you feel passionate about it, you should definitely submit that.

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,520
One set of people who I'm particularly interested in for this competition are the teachers and the

56
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,480
lecturers, and basically anyone with a lot of boots-to-the-ground experience seeing people

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,040
learn and seeing what actually works, because I think there's a lot of outstanding explanations

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,400
out there that stay largely confined to the classroom or otherwise stay offline, whereas

59
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,200
if just a little bit of effort was put into producing it or sharing it online in some way,

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,320
those lessons might actually reach and benefit one to two orders of magnitude more people.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,040
And I get it, teachers are absurdly busy, they don't have time for extra things on the side,

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,680
and it's kind of hard to know where to get started. So maybe one potential partnership here would be

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,560
the teachers who have really good instincts for what works in education, and then a student who

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,320
maybe has a lot of energy or desire to get started on YouTube or otherwise just has more free time on

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,880
their hands, and pairing something together like that might actually make for a good partnership.

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,200
In either case, whatever category you fall into, I do know there's a lot of people who do want to

67
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,680
get started with this, because they write to me a lot, and one of the most common sentiments out

68
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
there is, well I don't know where to get started, right, I want to make a video but I don't really

69
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,320
have any experience with video making, things like that. And I have a couple things to say for

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:37,040
someone who feels like they're in that boat. In a kind of loose conjunction with this contest,

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,080
I decided to start a podcast where for the first many conversations I'll be interviewing people

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,800
who have some kind of experience in the space of putting out explanations. So that could be

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
other YouTubers, but it could also include mathematicians who are really engaged with

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,920
outreach, or the founder of Khan Academy, things like this, and essentially have conversations

75
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,360
which act to either inspire or otherwise inform anyone who might be getting started with this.

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,160
After doing several of these interviews, one of the most useful pieces of information that I think

77
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,520
comes out from them is just how ramshackle and unprofessional the setup for a lot of people is

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,280
in the very beginning. And as a result, it should come as no surprise that one of the

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
most common pieces of advice, one of the most universal answers to the question of what advice

80
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,880
would you give to someone getting started with this, is to just start. The things that differentiate

81
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,120
the people who actually put stuff out there versus the ones who don't is not a matter of

82
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
having a lot more experience with it beforehand. It's a matter of having a kind of generative

83
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,960
spirit that just wants to make stuff. Because my, I say persona, but this is, you know me,

84
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,880
this is genuinely me, is give it a go. You're probably going to fail, but it's worth a try.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,480
I get a lot of people kind of saying, oh, like you make YouTube videos. I've always

86
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,360
wanted to make YouTube videos. And I'm like, great, just do it. And they're like, no, no,

87
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
but I need to buy a nice camera and I need to get a good set. And I'm like, no, no, no,

88
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,040
like just do it. There's always this temptation. Oh wait, am I ready yet? Am I ready yet? And I

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,480
just say, Sal, press record and start, see what happens. If I take the example, which I know best,

90
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,600
which is my own, there are so many really embarrassing things about the early videos

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,560
on this channel or my process in creating them. I mean, the sound quality was pretty terrible for

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,280
a long time is that's one big thing. Uh, I edited in iMovie for way longer than I care to admit,

93
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,880
also, despite being now a like professional YouTuber when it comes to cameras and actually

94
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
filming things like this, I really have no idea what I'm doing. Like right now I'm just using a

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,280
phone, which I guess is fine. I find the process of being alone in a room and just talking to a

96
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,320
camera incredibly awkward. Uh, this is actually my second time recording this whole video because the

97
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,320
first time I thought I would be really clever and have some notes to like guide what I wanted to say.

98
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,120
And I'd put them on the monitor next to the camera. But what the result was is that I would

99
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,840
just kind of have my eyes darting back and forth between the two without me consciously realizing

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,880
it. It was just this reminder that I really don't know what I'm doing, but this isn't a self-effacing

101
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,600
thing. The point here is that if you find yourself with a potentially good explainer that you want to

102
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,360
make, but you're a little self-conscious about how to start, or you're worried that you're going to

103
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,560
make a mistake, just don't worry about it. Just dive right in. So many of us have no idea what

104
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,720
we're doing when we begin. All that said, sometimes this just do it advice is a little

105
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,680
bit frustrating because I mean it's not actionable. You say, okay, I'm going to start, but then upon

106
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,800
starting it tells you nothing. So in the spirit of some more concrete advice, I do have a couple

107
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,080
things that I might want to pass along that are specific to the case of math explainers. The first

108
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,400
one, and I do actually find this quite important, is when you're putting together the explanation,

109
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,440
whatever form, whatever medium, whatever genre you choose, try to be aware of the layers of

110
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
abstraction that are relevant to your topic. So like if you're teaching a young child about

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
fractions and you're talking about two-thirds plus one-fifth, there's two different layers

112
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
of abstraction that that expression lives in. There's one where you have a very concrete example

113
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,240
of two-thirds of something, two-thirds of a cake, and then one-fifth of a cake, and trying to get a

114
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
sense of what that means. And then there's the symbols, and a big part of the lesson at play here

115
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,320
is understanding how the symbols relate to the actual case and why the rules that we apply to

116
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,520
the symbols make sense in light of the concrete case. And also why we opt to do the more abstract

117
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,880
thing because it takes much less thinking than actually trying to reason about, you know,

118
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,600
two-thirds of a cake plus one-fifth of a cake. And this happens at all levels. If you're teaching

119
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,360
a calculus class and you're talking about optimizing functions, you know, there's the idea

120
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
of a function as a very abstract thing that could be any particular function or any differentiable

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,880
function or what have you. And then there's lots of specific examples, or maybe specific cases

122
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,880
where they come up, like a function defining the profit of a company, and that's the thing you want

123
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,760
to optimize. I made a whole video about group theory where in the middle I went on for a while

124
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,160
about the difference between thinking of group actions as these abstract entities versus as

125
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,040
something concrete like asymmetry, and why there exists the two and what the benefits and trade-offs

126
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,160
are. But my point in this first piece of advice is not merely to address the layers of abstraction.

127
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,880
You don't even have to. But if you're clear in your own head, try very hard to structure your

128
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,640
explanation to go from the concrete to the abstract. I think almost always when you

129
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,360
understand something, the natural inclination is to go the other way around. I find myself doing

130
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,280
this in pretty much any first draft of a script that I have. It seems like all the textbook

131
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,160
authors that I ever read tend to do this. You start with the abstract idea, you put the examples later.

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,440
But I really do think that in the case of learning, first trying to populate the learner's mind with

133
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,760
a bunch of examples of things that have a similar pattern between them, and letting their brain do

134
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,320
the abstraction, see that similar pattern between things, such that when you bring in that higher

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
layer, you start defining an abstract vector space, or you're doing some symbolic manipulations

136
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,400
with particular rules. Once that happens, you're articulating something in the brain of the learner

137
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,080
that was already sitting there in the first place. It wasn't just handed to them in a vacuum.

138
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,080
Otherwise, it's a little bit like trying to build a building from the top floor down.

139
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,000
So that's one, and that's very specific to math. As a more generic idea, piece of advice number two

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,600
would be keep in the very forefront of your mind the fact that content is king, that the thing that

141
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,000
you're explaining, the choice of the topic or how you're explaining it, determines the majority of

142
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
the value and the quality of the thing that you make. All the things about production quality, or

143
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
you know, how fancy the animations are, or the lighting, or whatever it is, all of that is secondary

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,960
to making sure you've chosen an actually good topic, and it's something that people would want

145
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,120
to consume. They haven't seen it elsewhere, it's offering something fresh. Now that's so easy to

146
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,320
nod along with and say like, yes, yes, of course, content is king. But the thing is, you end up

147
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
spending about 1% of your time, if that, choosing what you're going to explain and how you're going

148
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,000
to explain it, and then like 99% of the time just carrying it out in some way. And as a result,

149
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,880
it can be easy to lose sight of that important part. So my encouragement to you would be spend

150
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,920
more time than you would otherwise tend to on choosing that topic. So maybe workshop a couple

151
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
different things by doing sample lessons with people, or try to write out a list of all the

152
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,840
different things that you could and ask, are they actually fresh? Are they actually adding something

153
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,400
to the space? Is there a reason someone would want to consume this? Spending that extra little bit of

154
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,520
time on the thing that determines the majority of the value is almost certainly worth it. And the

155
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,560
third piece of advice, which maybe plays into this a little bit, is when you're beginning, if you're

156
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,640
just starting something fresh, and there's no presence online at this point, try to choose

157
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,920
something much more esoteric and specific than you might be inclined to. I've seen a lot of people who

158
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,000
want to get started on YouTube, for example. And the way that they try to go about it is to choose

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
a topic that will appeal to the most people. After all, they want their video to blow up, they want a

160
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,800
lot of subscribers and things like that. But there's a couple issues with this. First of all, it's a

161
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
much more competitive space if you're going to try to describe something that a lot of people might

162
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,120
be searching for. So if you go in saying, I'm going to do a series about quantum mechanics,

163
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,280
well, there's a billion others out there, and yours is going to have to stand out for some reason,

164
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,560
and you don't have a foothold at that point. But another one is that the very specific and niche

165
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,200
things build a much more loyal audience in that beginning, because you're offering something which

166
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,760
they could not find anywhere else. And sometimes to be the consumer of something very specific is

167
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,160
such a good feeling that you want to pay it back and you find yourself rooting for the creator.

168
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,280
So you're much more likely to get very good faith feedback, just a warmer community. And also,

169
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,200
oftentimes we tend to overestimate just how niche things are. Like sometimes something that's so

170
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,800
weirdly specific, some very esoteric bit of engineering, actually appeals to hundreds of

171
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
thousands or millions of people, especially if you yourself are enthusiastic about it and people can

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,880
index on that. So by doing that, you find yourself often with a topic that actually does have a

173
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
broader appeal, but it's not competitive with the things that everyone thinks will have broader

174
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,840
appeal. And you potentially get that audience loyalty. When I started this channel, I really

175
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,680
was thinking of it as a very niche thing. I did not think it would be a thing that a lot of people

176
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,000
would want to watch. I actually specifically wanted to find topics in math that no one would

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
think to search for. That was kind of the original conception that I wavered from a little bit

178
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,720
afterward. The fourth piece of advice is to pick a genre that your piece falls into. So the other

179
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,400
day I was giving this talk to a group of people and one of them wanted to get started making

180
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,080
online explainers. And they asked whether it was ethical for someone who's just barely learning a

181
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,400
topic, just starting to learn it, to also make explainers of it online. I mean, after all,

182
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,320
they're more likely to make mistakes. They don't know the broader context. And there's so many

183
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,040
things I like about that question. It's already demonstrating a kind of care and consideration

184
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,320
for factual accuracy and doing right by the student that more people who are making online

185
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,280
explanations should consider. So that very fact suggested to me that this person probably should

186
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,080
be doing it. But one of the things I suggested is to acknowledge there are different types of

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,400
explainers out there. There's the type where the narrator is a little bit more distanced. They're

188
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,120
kind of standing on top of a hill and explaining the way that things are. And to do that, you

189
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,760
really have to research the topic very deeply. You should probably know 10 times as much about

190
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,000
the topic as what you're actually saying in the content so that you know that you're teeing things

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,320
up for where it actually leads or you're being cognizant of whatever nuances there are, things

192
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,720
like that. But another genre entirely is the discovery journalism, where the person who is

193
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,600
learning the topic kind of just admits that fact or is open about the fact that they're just

194
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
starting with it and taking the viewer along a journey with them. And many times that's actually

195
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,240
a better piece of content. It's actually better for learning the topic. And it comes with this

196
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,120
inbuilt piece of humility that a lot of online content lacks. But there's lots of other genres

197
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
like this. There's the worked example where you're explicitly helping people with homework.

198
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,560
There's the try to find an interesting demo and serve mainly to inspire. And basically just before

199
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,880
you get started, decide which one of those you feel like you're the best fit for. And then when

200
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,680
you're looking at other pieces out there, other explainers, and trying to index off of what seems

201
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,320
to work, what doesn't, be aware of which ones are in the lane that you intend to be in and don't

202
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,600
necessarily pattern match off of the ones that aren't. One of the mistakes I think I made with my

203
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,720
very first video is I had this conception that sometimes if you talk faster than is comfortable

204
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,280
on the internet, that sort of works. That's like a satisfying thing to consume because there are

205
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,080
videos out there that are this fire hose of information and something about that scratches

206
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,960
an itch and I think people like it. But what I didn't really appreciate was the fact that math

207
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,440
should fall into a completely different category than that. It is not fun at all to have math come

208
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
at you at this fire hose rate. And basically I was just pattern matching off of things that I should

209
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,160
not have been pattern matching off of. As point number five, or I don't actually know where I am

210
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,560
at the list at this point, especially in the case of math, if you're bringing up definitions of

211
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,160
things, try not to let them feel too arbitrary. Try to let them be well motivated. Explain why

212
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,760
that's the definition, what else it could have been. Try to make it something that the learner

213
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,880
feels like they discovered themselves. Because too often we hand these things down on high as

214
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,720
the starting point and it's not really clear why or where that came from. So all of that is just on

215
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
the content side. What exactly are you explaining independent of the multimedia component of it?

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,080
The sound and the video and all that. And like I said, content is king. That definitely determines

217
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,080
the majority of quality. But it does actually matter a little bit beyond that to have at least

218
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,480
a little bit of production quality, I think. And I'll give a really good example. So I was watching

219
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,240
this lecture the other day by Tadashi Tokieda on just a really interesting set of ideas about

220
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,520
applying physical intuition to solving math problems. And he had in there maybe seven or eight

221
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,360
outstanding little arguments that each one of which could have been just a beautiful video in

222
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,520
its own right. But the talk was over Zoom and the intro was really long and the sound quality is

223
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,160
everything that you assume from Zoom and the lighting of his shot was weird. And the talk was

224
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,800
really good. And I do think it's great that it's online and a lot of people will be consuming it.

225
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,840
But it's probably fair to say that if all of that content, the actual set of ideas, was instead, say,

226
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,320
a Numberphile video, it would reach 100 times as many people. And more than that, it would be a

227
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,480
more pleasant experience for those who are consuming it. And it really doesn't take that

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,360
much. So I'll just end with a couple pieces of advice on that front. The first one, which,

229
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,720
again, I acknowledge is very hypocritical here, is sound quality actually matters, especially in

230
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,000
an era of Zoom where we are all inundated with this sort of suboptimal version of the voices of

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,480
all the people in our lives. The learner will appreciate a respite from all that with something

232
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
that actually comes from a good microphone that you learned how to use at some point.

233
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,640
On the side of visuals, you know, I'm obviously a big believer in the idea that a well-chosen

234
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,240
illustration or an animation can really make a mathematical idea a lot more clear and be an

235
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,280
example of that concretization and kind of going from the lower layer of abstraction on upward by

236
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,560
just showing exactly what it is on screen in some way. Now, the way I do things is with programmatic

237
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,680
animations. I sort of wrote this custom library called Manum to do that. And last year, actually,

238
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,560
a group of people that called themselves the Manum community created a fork of it with the hope of

239
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,480
making it a lot more user-friendly. And I think they succeeded with that. There's a lot better

240
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,080
documentation. It's better tested, just all around friendlier to use. So you can use that tool. And

241
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,240
thanks to them, it's actually a lot easier than it used to be. There's some other libraries that

242
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,560
I've seen that mention Manum as an inspiration, you know, one that's written in Julia or one

243
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,680
that's in Haskell. And it doesn't have to be programmatic either. I think where programmatic

244
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,280
animations make sense for math is if you're somehow leveraging loops or conditionals or

245
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,080
layers of abstraction. And in the right context, I think it can be a wonderful way to let the

246
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,280
visuals authentically reflect the math that you're describing. If the code is essentially just that

247
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,920
math as it's illustrating things, but it doesn't have to be. And a lot of times people use Manum

248
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,000
or other programmatic animations for things that do not need to be programmatic, that you could

249
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,960
have easily done in something like Keynote or which add flashiness for flashiness's sake that

250
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,240
doesn't actually aid with the explanation. I think one really good example of using traditional

251
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,800
animation software is the channel Boerbach Tree. So he really has these friendly handwritten

252
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,160
kind of whiteboard lectures, but uses animation to help those whiteboards come alive. And he uses

253
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,920
Adobe Animate for that. And I think it's a really nice way to make this friendly hand-drawn

254
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,080
environment come to life, which is different from kind of the platonic stark, this is precisely what

255
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,800
the math would draw when you're illustrating a surface or something like that. Also, I see a lot

256
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,600
of people use Manum to manipulate algebraic expressions and things like that. But if you

257
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,400
look at other videos, things like Mathologer, you know, he's doing a lot of that in PowerPoint. And

258
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,200
again, content is king. The first thing is to focus on what are you actually describing, and then just

259
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,240
showing it however is easiest to show it in that case works totally fine. You don't need anything

260
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,720
extremely precise or that leverages loops and abstraction for the formulas. I recognize a kind

261
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,960
of hypocrisy here, but you know, I have walked myself into a certain corner with the style that

262
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,560
I want for the channel. If you do want to go down that hole of programmatic animations, though, another

263
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,000
tool which has popped up recently is something called smoothstep.io, which I think is a really

264
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,880
nice way for people to get started with shaders, which are an absurdly powerful way to do absurdly

265
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,360
beautiful things. And it's written by this guy, Matt Henderson, who has a Twitter account that

266
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,040
everyone should follow because he has some of the most beautiful math illustrations that I think

267
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,080
I've ever seen. So experimenting with software like that is another rabbit hole that you could go down

268
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,160
if, say, you want to use this competition as an excuse to try something new, something that you've

269
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,160
always wanted to get started with but never really had the excuse to do. Now, if you have some pieces

270
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,400
of advice that you want to pass along to people, or if you want to just engage with the community

271
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
in some way to see what other people are thinking of making, or propose your own project ideas,

272
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,680
get feedback, talk about software, anything like that, we did set up a Discord space associated

273
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,560
with the Summer of Math Exposition. There's a link in the description. Just be mindful if you do

274
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,920
contribute to that community that you want your comments to be encouraging to others who are

275
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,880
getting started and productive to that goal, and you know, try to avoid anything that is the opposite

276
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,320
of that goal. And again, another source of what will hopefully include some inspirational or

277
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,280
informative things will be the podcast. The first episode is out now. It's with the mathematician

278
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Alex Kontorovich, who some of you may recognize from the video he did with Quanta, or the video

279
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,920
he did with Veritasium on Pi Day. The episode after that is going to be with Sal Khan, and there's just

280
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,760
a really interesting lineup of people here, so I think you'll enjoy it. You can get it wherever you

281
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,120
get your podcasts. There's a video version of it, which is going to live on a second channel that

282
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,520
is just my name, Grant Sanderson, and I figure for all future videos that are a little bit like this

283
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
one that's not really animated math but other stuff, that's probably the channel that I'll put

284
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,480
it on, so keep an eye on that channel if that's something that you're interested in. And I will

285
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,880
say this about the podcast, even though the original intent was something that was very much

286
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,000
tied to this competition and the idea of targeting people interested in getting started, a lot of the

287
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,360
times I would find myself with an interesting guest, and I just have a whole bunch of other

288
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,600
things that I want to ask them that have nothing to do with that. So maybe the better framing here

289
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:15,040
is to say that the podcast is 20% about that goal, and the other 80% is just the usual interview-style

290
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,840
podcast vibe where you have interesting guests, and I just want to ask things that I'm genuinely

291
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,600
curious to know about them. And then I get to grad school, and I'm moving into my office in grad

292
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,240
school, and I have all my old papers, and I just started for fun leafing through them. I don't know

293
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,080
if you ever look back at the stuff you wrote freshman year. And I look at it, I'm like,

294
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,320
what the hell was I writing? Oh my god, this is garbage. This is complete. The epsilons and

295
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,400
deltas are backwards. You can't have the epsilons and deltas be backwards. And you only took off

296
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,680
three points. I would have taken off nine or something. Rami was so nice. So if Lean was

297
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,640
around back then, boy, would it have straightened me out. It's actually very inspiring to me because

298
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:05,680
one of the common pieces of advice that I'll give to someone if they want to learn more math is...
