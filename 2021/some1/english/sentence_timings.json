  531.34

 [

 [
  "There's one where you have a very concrete example of two-thirds of something, two-thirds of a cake, and then one-fifth of a cake, and trying to get a sense of what that means.",

  547.28
 ],
 [
  "And then there's the symbols, and a big part of the lesson at play here is understanding how the symbols relate to the actual case and why the rules that we apply to the symbols make sense in light of the concrete case.",
  547.52,
  558.7
 ],
 [
  "And also why we opt to do the more abstract thing because it takes much less thinking than actually trying to reason about you know two-thirds of a cake plus one-fifth of a cake.",

  567.1
 ],
 [
  "And this happens at all levels.",
  568.04,
  569.22

 [
  "If you're teaching a calculus class and you're talking about optimizing functions, you know there's the idea of a function as a very abstract thing that could be any particular function or any differentiable function or what have you.",
  569.22,
  579.3
 ],
 [

  601.54
 ],
 [
  "But my point in this first piece of advice is not merely to address the layers of abstraction, you don't even have to, but if you're clear in your own head try very hard to structure your explanation to go from the concrete to the abstract.",

  624.38,
  627.28
 ],
 [
  "You start with the abstract idea, you put the examples later, but I really do think that in the case of learning first trying to populate the learner's mind with a bunch of examples of things that have a similar pattern between them and letting their brain do the abstraction, see that similar pattern between things such that when you bring in that higher layer you start defining you know an abstract vector space or you're doing some symbolic manipulations with particular rules.",
  627.32,
  650.0
 ],
 [
  "That once that happens you're articulating something in the brain of the learner that was already sitting there in the first place, it wasn't just handed to them in a vacuum.",
  650.54,
  658.12
 ],
 [
  "Otherwise it's a little bit like trying to build a building from the top floor down.",
  658.92,
  662.24
 ],
 [
  "So that's one and that's very specific to math.",
  662.96,
  664.84
 ],
 [
  "As a more generic idea, piece of advice number two would be keep in the very forefront of your mind the fact that content is king, that the thing that you're explaining, the choice of the topic or how you're explaining it, determines the majority of the value and the quality of the thing that you make.",
  665.34,
  680.04
 ],
 [
  "All the things about production quality or you know how fancy the animations are or the lighting or whatever it is, all of that is secondary to making sure you've chosen an actually good topic and it's something that people would want to consume.",
  680.28,
  693.54
 ],
 [
  "They haven't seen it elsewhere, it's offering something fresh.",
  693.74,
  695.84
 ],
 [
  "Now that's so easy to nod along with and say like yes yes of course content is king, but the thing is you end up spending about one percent of your time if that choosing what you're going to explain and how you're going to explain it and then like 99% of the time just carrying it out in some way and as a result it can be easy to lose sight of that important part.",
  696.54,

 [
  "So my encouragement to you would be spend more time than you would otherwise tend to on choosing that topic.",
  714.88,
  720.44

 [
  "Spending that extra little bit of time on the thing that determines the majority of the value is almost certainly worth it.",
  733.28,
  739.06

 [
  "And the third piece of advice which maybe plays into this a little bit is when you're beginning if you're starting something fresh and there's no presence online at this point, try to choose something much more esoteric and specific than you might be inclined to.",
  739.56,
  752.2

  "First of all it's a much more competitive space if you're going to try to describe something that a lot of people might be searching for.",

  771.62

 [
  "So if you go in saying I'm going to do a series about quantum mechanics, well there's a billion others out there and yours is going to have to stand out for some reason and you don't have a foothold at that point.",
  771.78,
  781.2
 ],
 [
  "But another one is that the very specific and niche things build a much more loyal audience in that beginning because you're offering something which they could not find anywhere else and sometimes to be the consumer of something very specific is such a good feeling that you want to pay it back and you find yourself rooting for the creator.",
  781.9,
  797.92
 ],
 [
  "So you're more likely to get very good faith feedback, just a warmer community.",
  798.46,

  802.64,
