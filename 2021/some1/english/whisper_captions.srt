00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
I want to tell you about a contest that I'm running with a friend of mine, James Schloss,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,840
who some of you might recognize from the YouTube channel LeosOS and his Twitch stream and things

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,360
like that. Also, now there's a 3b1b podcast, but more on that in just a moment.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,620
Basically, we want there to be more math explanation online, and we want to encourage

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,140
more people to get started actually doing it. We're calling it the Summer of Math Exposition,

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,400
where essentially we're just inviting anyone who wants to to submit some kind of math explainer,

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,940
whether that's a video or a blog post or an interactive game or whatever it is that

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,720
explains math online in some way, to the link that's on screen now by August 22nd. And then

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:52,620
once we... Yes, I see you. Would you like to sniff at the microphone? Oh yes, that's very sweet.

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,960
Very sweet. You're a very affectionate creature. All right, where was I? Anyway, after August 22nd,

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,100
we're going to have a selection process to choose some winners from among them, and then I'll

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,660
feature them in a 3b1b video. And then for the rest, I'll probably also put together a playlist

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,880
of all of the videos and a list of links on the website somewhere to all the project submissions.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,200
And then I was also thinking maybe I would send something to the winners, like creating some

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,160
custom gold plushie pie creatures or something like that. But the main prize is to have your

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,220
work featured and hopefully get it out to a few more people. The reason I'm interested in doing

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,140
this is I think there's a lot of people out there who would be really good at doing this, would have

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,380
some excellent explanation that would genuinely help a lot of people or show a topic that's not

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,500
really covered very well elsewhere. And who might even be thinking about doing it. You know, there's

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,040
that back of your mind spot that says maybe one day I'll try my hand at a video or just write this

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,560
up as a blog post. But you just never really got around to it. You know, life's busy. You're not

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,800
sure where to start. It seems like there's a lot of other things out there. And my hope is that by

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,880
dangling the tiniest carrot that I can provide, just mentioning good work when it exists, then

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,400
maybe that gets a couple more people over this hump who might otherwise not have made something

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,920
and then actually make it. So one of the very few constraints on entries for this particular contest

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,500
is that it has to be something new. It can't be a thing that you made a while ago and you're just

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,840
submitting a link to it now, but something that you make between now and August 22nd.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,020
And the real spirit of this all is to encourage people who have never tried it before to get

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,280
started in it somehow. The other constraint is that it does have to be about math, but math in

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,820
the broadest possible sense of the term. So that could include physics or computer science, as long

31
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,200
as it's got some mathy components to it. So if you're doing physics and there's formulas that

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,700
are relevant, don't shy away from those formulas. Or if you're doing some computer science and

33
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,180
there's some, you know, algorithmic complexity or something mathematical to it, try to lean into

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,220
that a little bit more. Other than that, the topic matter is completely up to you. So maybe

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,620
you have some topics that you've seen or that you've learned about, but what you really feel

36
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,340
aren't covered well online anywhere. And it would really be adding something new to the space. Maybe

37
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,180
you're a physics buff who is interested in the philosophical side of things, and you've learned

38
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,440
about Conway's freewheel theorem, and you want to talk about it and whether that's an appropriate

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,940
name, whether it's actually philosophically interesting or not, or just share with people

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,240
what it is. Or maybe you're someone who's into information theory and things like that,

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,580
and you've learned about how Kolmogorov complexity can be used to describe some things about the

42
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,460
distributions of primes, and you think that's actually an interesting angle for how to introduce

43
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,580
Kolmogorov complexity in the first place. Or anything like this where it's something kind of

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,240
new to the space, if that's you, you should definitely consider submitting. But it doesn't

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,020
have to be a topic that no one has ever covered or that's severely under covered online. Even if

46
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,860
it's something that's very standard, and especially if it's something that a lot of students have to

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,440
reach at some point, coming up with a better way to explain it, kind of thinking about what's the

48
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,000
state-of-the-art explanation on any particular thing, that could also add a lot to the space.

49
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,700
Say for example you've taught students about partial fraction decomposition and tutoring or

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,360
teaching or something like that, and you feel like you've come across a way of explaining it that

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,800
makes it a little bit more memorable, you should definitely submit. Or maybe you have some really

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,320
pretty way to visualize certain trig identities that students run into that keeps them from

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,080
very rote and instead sheds a light on how beautiful math can be and all that kind of thing.

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,880
If that's you and you feel passionate about it, you should definitely submit that.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,660
One set of people who I'm particularly interested in for this competition are the teachers and the

56
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,540
lecturers, and basically anyone with a lot of boots-to-the-ground experience seeing people

57
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,960
learn and seeing what actually works. Because I think there's a lot of outstanding explanations

58
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,340
out there that stay largely confined to the classroom or otherwise stay offline, whereas

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,980
if just a little bit of effort was put into producing it or sharing it online in some way,

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,960
those lessons might actually reach and benefit one to two orders of magnitude more people.

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,960
And I get it, teachers are absurdly busy, they don't have time for extra things on the side,

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,560
and it's kind of hard to know where to get started. So maybe one potential partnership here would be

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,680
the teachers who have really good instincts for what works in education, and then a student who

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,320
maybe has a lot of energy or desire to get started on YouTube or otherwise just has more free time

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,640
and pairing something together like that might actually make for a good partnership.

66
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,300
In either case, whatever category you fall into, I do know there's a lot of people who do want to

67
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,740
get started with this, because they write to me a lot, and one of the most common sentiments out

68
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,720
there is, well I don't know where to get started, I want to make a video but I don't really have

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,440
any experience with video making, things like that. And I have a couple things to say for

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,980
who feels like they're in that boat.

71
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,600
In a kind of loose conjunction with this contest, I decided to start a podcast where for the first

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,620
many conversations I'll be interviewing people who have some kind of experience in the space

73
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,100
of putting out explanations. So that could be other YouTubers, but it could also include

74
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,920
mathematicians who are really engaged with outreach, or the founder of Khan Academy,

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,020
like this, and essentially have conversations which act to either inspire or otherwise inform

76
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,060
anyone who might be getting started with this. After doing several of these interviews,

77
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,540
one of the most useful pieces of information that I think comes out from them is just how

78
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,940
ramshackle and unprofessional the setup for a lot of people is in the very beginning. And as a

79
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,380
result, it should come as no surprise that one of the most common pieces of advice, one of the most

80
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,300
universal answers to the question of what advice would you give to someone getting started with

81
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,840
this is to just start. The things that differentiate the people who actually put stuff out there

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,180
versus the ones who don't is not a matter of having a lot more experience with it beforehand.

83
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,560
It's a matter of having a kind of generative spirit that just wants to make stuff.

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Because my, I say persona, but this is, you know, me, this is genuinely me is give it a go.

85
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,840
You're probably going to fail, but it's worth a try.

86
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,620
I get a lot of people kind of saying, oh, like you make YouTube videos. I've always

87
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,500
wanted to make YouTube videos. And I'm like, great, just do it. And they're like, no, no,

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,040
but I need to buy a nice camera and I need to get a good set. And I'm like, no, no, no,

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,340
like, just do it. There's always this temptation. Wait, am I ready yet? Am I ready yet? And I just

90
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,960
say, Sal, press record and start, see what happens. If I take the example, which I know best, which is

91
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,300
my own, there are so many really embarrassing things about the early videos on this channel

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,400
or my process in creating them. I mean, the sound quality was pretty terrible for a long time is

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:23,520
one big thing. I edited in iMovie for way longer than I care to admit. Also, despite being now a

94
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
like professional YouTuber, when it comes to cameras and actually filming things like this,

95
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
I really have no idea what I'm doing. Like right now, I'm just using a phone, which I guess is

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,900
fine. I find the process of being alone in a room and just talking to a camera incredibly awkward.

97
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,240
This is actually my second time recording this whole video because the first time I thought I

98
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,020
had a phone, I thought I would be really clever and have some notes to like guide what I wanted

99
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,100
to say and I'd put them on the monitor next to the camera. But what the result was is that I

100
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,340
would just kind of have my eyes darting back and forth between the two without me consciously

101
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,180
realizing it. It was just this reminder that I really don't know what I'm doing. But this isn't

102
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,200
a self-effacing thing. The point here is that if you find yourself with a potentially good explainer

103
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,760
that you want to make, but you're a little self-conscious about how to start or you're

104
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,620
just don't worry about it, just dive right in. So many of us have no idea what we're doing when we begin.

105
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,860
All that said, sometimes this just do it advice is a little bit frustrating because I mean it's not

106
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,720
actionable. You say okay I'm gonna start, but then upon starting it tells you nothing. So in the

107
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,240
spirit of some more concrete advice, I do have a couple things that I might want to pass along

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,460
that are specific to the case of math explainers. The first one, and I do actually find this quite

109
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,100
important, is when you're putting together the explanation, whatever form, whatever medium, whatever

110
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,340
genre you choose, try to be aware of the layers of abstraction that are relevant to your topic.

111
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,600
So like if you're teaching a young child about fractions and you're talking about two-thirds plus

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,460
one-fifth, there's two different layers of abstraction that that expression lives in.

113
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,800
There's one where you have a very concrete example of two-thirds of something, two-thirds of a cake,

114
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,480
and then one-fifth of a cake, and trying to get a sense of what that means. And then there's the

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,240
symbols, and a big part of the lesson at play here is understanding how the symbols relate to the

116
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,700
actual case and why the rules that we apply to the symbols make sense in light of the concrete case.

117
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,900
And also why we opt to do the more abstract thing because it takes much less thinking than actually

118
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,640
trying to reason about you know two-thirds of a cake plus one-fifth of a cake. And this happens

119
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,420
at all levels. If you're teaching a calculus class and you're talking about optimizing functions,

120
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,820
you know there's the idea of a function as a very abstract thing that could be any particular

121
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,660
function or any differentiable function or what have you. And then there's lots of specific

122
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,840
examples or maybe specific cases where they come up like a function defining the profit of a

123
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,540
company and that's the thing you want to optimize. I made a whole video about group theory where in

124
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,100
the middle I went on for a while about the difference between thinking of group actions

125
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,440
as these abstract entities versus as something concrete like asymmetry and why there exists the

126
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,060
two and what the benefits and trade-offs are. But my point in this first piece of advice is not

127
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,360
merely to address the layers of abstraction, you don't even have to, but if you're clear in your

128
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,060
own head try very hard to structure your explanation to go from the concrete to the abstract.

129
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,500
I think almost always when you understand something the natural inclination is to go the

130
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,960
other way around. I find myself doing this in pretty much any first draft of a script that I have.

131
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,140
It seems like all the textbook authors that I ever read tend to do this. You start with the abstract

132
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,860
idea, you put the examples later, but I really do think that in the case of learning first trying to

133
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,480
populate the learner's mind with a bunch of examples of things that have a similar pattern between them

134
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,400
and letting their brain do the abstraction, see that similar pattern between things such that when

135
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,500
you bring in that higher layer you start defining you know an abstract vector space or you're doing

136
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,900
some symbolic manipulations with particular rules. That once that happens you're articulating something

137
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,960
in the brain of the learner that was already sitting there in the first place, it wasn't just

138
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,540
handed to them in a vacuum. Otherwise it's a little bit like trying to build a building from the top

139
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,180
floor down. So that's one and that's very specific to math. As a more generic idea, piece of advice

140
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,200
number two would be keep in the very forefront of your mind the fact that content is king, that the

141
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
thing that you're explaining, the choice of the topic or how you're explaining it, determines the

142
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,600
majority of the value and the quality of the thing that you make. All the things about production

143
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,640
quality or you know how fancy the animations are or the lighting or whatever it is, all of that is

144
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,840
secondary to making sure you've chosen an actually good topic and it's something that people would

145
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,080
want to consume. They haven't seen it elsewhere, it's offering something fresh. Now that's so easy

146
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,440
to nod along with and say like yes yes of course content is king, but the thing is you end up

147
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,320
spending about one percent of your time if that choosing what you're going to explain and how

148
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,800
you're going to explain it and then like 99% of the time just carrying it out in some way and as a

149
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,300
result it can be easy to lose sight of that important part. So my encouragement to you would be

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,960
spend more time than you would otherwise tend to on choosing that topic. So maybe workshop a couple

151
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,860
different things by doing sample lessons with people or try to write out a list of all the

152
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,860
different things that you could and ask are they actually fresh, are they actually adding something

153
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,460
to the space, is there a reason someone would want to consume this. Spending that extra little bit of

154
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,700
time on the thing that determines the majority of the value is almost certainly worth it. And the

155
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,680
third piece of advice which maybe plays into this a little bit is when you're beginning if you're

156
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,400
starting something fresh and there's no presence online at this point, try to choose something much

157
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,280
more esoteric and specific than you might be inclined to. I've seen a lot of people who want

158
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,520
to get started on YouTube for example and the way that they try to go about it is to choose a topic

159
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,460
that will appeal to the most people. After all they want their video to blow up, they want a lot

160
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,040
of subscribers and things like that. But there's a couple issues with this. First of all it's a much

161
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,820
more competitive space if you're going to try to describe something that a lot of people might be

162
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,640
searching for. So if you go in saying I'm going to do a series about quantum mechanics, well there's

163
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,840
a billion others out there and yours is going to have to stand out for some reason and you don't

164
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,160
have a foothold at that point. But another one is that the very specific and niche things build a

165
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
much more loyal audience in that beginning because you're offering something which they could not

166
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,160
find anywhere else and sometimes to be the consumer of something very specific is such a

167
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,700
good feeling that you want to pay it back and you find yourself rooting for the creator. So you're

168
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:25,540
more likely to get very good faith feedback, just a warmer community. And also oftentimes we tend to

169
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,380
overestimate just how niche things are. Like sometimes something that's so weirdly specific, some

170
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,220
very esoteric bit of engineering actually appeals to hundreds of thousands or millions of people,

171
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,960
especially if you yourself are enthusiastic about it and people can index on that. So by doing that

172
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,020
you find yourself often with a topic that actually does have a broader appeal but it's not competitive

173
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,260
with the things that everyone thinks will have broader appeal and you potentially get that

174
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,760
audience loyalty. When I started this channel I really was thinking of it as a very niche thing,

175
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,800
I did not think it would be a thing that a lot of people would want to watch. I actually specifically

176
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,880
wanted to find topics in math that no one would think to search for, that was kind of the original

177
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,700
conception that I wavered from a little bit afterward. The fourth piece of advice is to

178
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,300
pick a genre that your piece falls into. So the other day I was giving this talk to a group of

179
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,760
people and one of them wanted to get started making online explainers and they asked whether

180
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,400
it was ethical for someone who's just barely learning a topic, just starting to learn it,

181
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,820
to also make explainers of it online. I mean after all they're more likely to make mistakes,

182
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,180
they don't know the broader context, and there's so many things I like about that question. It's

183
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,520
already demonstrating a kind of care and consideration for factual accuracy and doing

184
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,260
right by the student that more people who are making online explanations should consider. So

185
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,120
that very fact suggested to me that this person probably should be doing it. But one of the things

186
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,980
I suggested is to acknowledge there are different types of explainers out there. There's the type

187
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,280
where the narrator is a little bit more distanced, they're kind of standing on top of a hill and

188
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,180
explaining the way that things are, and to do that you really have to research the topic very deeply.

189
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,700
You should probably know 10 times as much about the topic as what you're actually saying in the

190
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,340
content so that you know that you're teeing things up for where it actually leads or you're being

191
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,600
cognizant of whatever nuances there are, things like that. But another genre entirely is the

192
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,800
discovery journalism, where the person who is learning the topic kind of just admits that fact

193
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,660
or is open about the fact that they're just starting with it and taking the viewer along

194
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,620
a journey with them. And many times that's actually a better piece of content, it's actually

195
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,520
better for learning the topic, and it comes with this inbuilt piece of humility that a lot of

196
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,260
online content lacks. But there's lots of other genres like this. There's the worked example where

197
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,900
you're explicitly helping people with homework, there's the try to find an interesting demo and

198
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,200
serve mainly to inspire, and basically just before you get started, decide which one of those you feel

199
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,560
like you're the best fit for, and then when you're looking at other pieces out there, other explainers

200
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,480
and trying to index off of what seems to work, what doesn't, be aware of which ones are in the

201
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,240
lane that you intend to be in and don't necessarily pattern match off of the ones that aren't.

202
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,580
You know, one of the mistakes I think I made with my very first video is I had this conception that

203
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,080
sometimes if you talk faster than is comfortable on the internet, that sort of works, that's like

204
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,400
a satisfying thing to consume. Because there are videos out there that are this fire hose of

205
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,420
information, and something about that scratches a niche and I think people like it, but what I

206
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,980
didn't really appreciate was the fact that math should fall into a completely different category

207
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,820
than that. It is not fun at all to have math come at you at this fire hose rate, and basically I was

208
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,000
just pattern matching off of things that I should not have been pattern matching off of. As point

209
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,380
number five, or I don't actually know where I am at the list at this point, especially in the case

210
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,760
of math, if you're bringing up definitions of things, try not to let them feel too arbitrary.

211
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,000
Try to let them be well motivated. Explain why that's the definition, what else it could have

212
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,360
been. Try to make it something that the learner feels like they discovered themselves, because too

213
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,500
often we hand these things down on high as the starting point, and it's not really clear why or

214
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,080
where that came from. So all of that is just on the content side, you know, what exactly are you

215
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,360
explaining independent of the multimedia component of it, you know, the sound and the video and all

216
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,200
that. And like I said, content is king, that definitely determines the majority of quality,

217
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,380
but it does actually matter a little bit beyond that to have at least a little bit of production

218
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,360
quality, I think. And I'll give a really good example. So I was watching this lecture the other

219
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,820
day by Tadashi Tokieda on just a really interesting set of ideas about applying physical intuition to

220
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,060
solving math problems, and he had in there maybe seven or eight outstanding little arguments that

221
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,860
could have been just a beautiful video in its own right. But the talk was over Zoom, and the intro

222
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,120
was really long, and the sound quality is everything that you assume from Zoom, and the lighting of his

223
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,900
shot was weird, and the talk was really good. And I do think, you know, it's great that it's online

224
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,540
and a lot of people will be consuming it, but it's probably fair to say that if all of that content,

225
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,340
the actual set of ideas, was instead, say, a Numberphile video, it would reach a hundred times

226
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,820
as many people. And more than that, it would be a more pleasant experience for those who are consuming

227
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,540
it. And it really doesn't take that much. So I'll just end with a couple pieces of advice on that

228
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,540
front. The first one, which again I acknowledge is very hypocritical here, is sound quality actually

229
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,020
matters, especially in an era of Zoom where we are all inundated with this sort of sub-optimal

230
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,760
version of the voices of all the people in our lives. The learner will appreciate a respite from

231
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,020
all that with something that actually comes from a good microphone that you learned how to use at

232
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,460
some point.

233
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,660
On the side of visuals, you know, I'm obviously a big believer in the idea that a well-chosen

234
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,340
illustration or an animation can really make a mathematical idea a lot more clear and be an

235
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,420
example of that concretization and kind of going from the lower layer of abstraction on upward by

236
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,600
just showing exactly what it is on screen in some way. Now the way I do things is with programmatic

237
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,700
animations. I sort of wrote this custom library called Manum to do that. And last year, actually,

238
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,540
a group of people that called themselves the Manum Community created a fork of it with the hope of

239
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,540
making it a lot more user-friendly. And I think they succeeded with that. There's a lot better

240
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,880
documentation, it's better tested, just all around friendlier to use. So you can use that tool and

241
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,380
thanks to them, it's actually a lot easier than it used to be. There's some other libraries that

242
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,680
I've seen that mention Manum as an inspiration, you know, one that's written in Julia or one

243
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,500
in Haskell. And it doesn't have to be programmatic either. I think where programmatic animations make

244
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,340
sense for math is if you're somehow leveraging loops or conditionals or layers of abstraction.

245
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,220
And in the right context, I think it can be a wonderful way to let the visuals authentically

246
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,160
reflect the math that you're describing, if the code is essentially just that math as it's

247
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,440
illustrating things. But it doesn't have to be. And a lot of times people use Manum or other

248
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,580
programmatic animations for things that do not need to be programmatic, that you could have easily

249
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,340
done in something like Keynote or which add flashiness for flashiness's sake that doesn't

250
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,740
actually aid with the explanation. I think one really good example of using traditional animation

251
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,280
software is the channel Boerbach Tree. So he really has these friendly handwritten kind of

252
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,600
whiteboard lectures, but uses animation to help those whiteboards come alive. And he uses Adobe

253
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,540
Animate for that. And I think it's a really nice way to make this friendly hand-drawn environment

254
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:24,520
come to life, which is different from kind of the platonic, stark, this is precisely what the math

255
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,180
would draw when you're illustrating a surface or something like that. Also, I see a lot of people

256
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,140
use Manum to manipulate algebraic expressions and things like that. But if you look at other

257
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,740
videos, things like Mathologer, he's doing a lot of that in PowerPoint. And again, content is king.

258
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,760
The first thing is to focus on what are you actually describing and then just showing it,

259
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,020
however, is easiest to show it in that case works totally fine. You don't need anything

260
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,820
extremely precise or that leverages loops and abstraction for the formulas. I recognize a kind

261
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,080
of hypocrisy here, but you know, I have walked myself into a certain corner with the style that

262
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,240
I want for the channel. If you do want to go down that hole of programmatic animations, though,

263
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,680
another tool which has popped up recently is something called smoothstep.io, which I think

264
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,960
is a really nice way for people to get started with shaders, which are an absurdly powerful way

265
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,960
to do absurdly beautiful things. And it's written by this guy, Matt Henderson, who has a Twitter

266
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,640
account that everyone should follow because he has some of the most beautiful math illustrations

267
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,100
that I think I've ever seen. So experimenting with software like that is another rabbit hole that you

268
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,640
could go down if, say, you want to use this competition as an excuse to try something new,

269
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,640
something that you've always wanted to get started with, but never really had the excuse to do.

270
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,200
Now, if you have some pieces of advice that you want to pass along to people,

271
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,460
or if you want to just engage with the community in some way to see what other people are thinking

272
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,460
of making or propose your own project ideas, get feedback, talk about software, anything like that,

273
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,480
we did set up a Discord space associated with the Summer of Math Exposition. There's a link in the

274
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,500
description. Just be mindful if you do contribute to that community that you want your comments to

275
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,720
be encouraging to others who are getting started and productive to that goal. And, you know,

276
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:10,100
try to avoid anything that is the opposite of that goal. And again, another source of what will

277
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,460
hopefully include some inspirational or informative things will be the podcast.

278
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,140
The first episode is out now. It's with the mathematician Alex Kontorovich, who some of you

279
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,340
may recognize from the video he did with Quanta or the video he did with Veritasium on Pi Day.

280
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
The episode after that is going to be with Sal Khan. And there's just a really interesting lineup

281
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,740
of people here. So I think you'll enjoy it. You can get it wherever you get your podcasts.

282
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,980
There's a video version of it, which is going to live on a second channel that is just my name,

283
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,860
Grant Sanderson. And I figure for all future videos that are a little bit like this one,

284
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,080
that's not really animated math, but other stuff, that's probably the channel that I'll put it on.

285
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,480
So keep an eye on that channel if that's something that you're interested in.

286
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,680
And I will say this about the podcast, even though the original intent was something that was very

287
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,040
much tied to this competition and the idea of targeting people interested in getting started,

288
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,100
a lot of the times I would find myself with an interesting guest and I just have a whole bunch

289
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,160
of other things that I want to ask them that have nothing to do with that. So maybe the better

290
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,700
framing here is to say that the podcast is 20% about that goal. And the other 80% is just the

291
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,160
usual interview style podcast vibe where you have interesting guests. And I just want to ask things

292
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,720
that I'm genuinely curious to know about them. And then I get to grad school and I'm moving into my

293
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
office in grad school and I have my, all my old papers and I just started, you know, for fun

294
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,460
leafing through them. I don't know if you ever look back at the stuff you wrote freshman year.

295
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,280
And I look at it, I'm like, what the hell was I writing? Oh my God, this is garbage. This is

296
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,020
complete. The epsilons and deltas are backwards. You can't have the epsilons and deltas be

297
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,700
backwards. And you only took off three points. I would have taken off, you know, nine or something

298
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,900
like Ramy was so nice. So if lean was around back then, boy, would it have straightened me out.

299
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,240
It's actually very inspiring to me because I feel one of the common

300
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,380
pieces of advice that I'll give to someone if they like want to learn more math.
