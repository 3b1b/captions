00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
Today I'd like to tell you about a piece of math known as holomorphic dynamics.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,712
This is the field which studies things like the Mandelbrot set, 

3
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:11,649
and in fact one of my main goals today is to show you how this iconic shape, 

4
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:15,944
the poster child of math, pops up in a more general way than the initial definition 

5
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:16,660
might suggest.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,289
Now this field is also intimately tied to what we talked about in the last video, 

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,722
with Newton's fractal, and another goal of ours towards the end of this 

8
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,060
video will be to help tie up some of the loose ends that we had there.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,540
So first of all, this word holomorphic might seem a little weird.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,201
It refers to functions that have complex number inputs and complex number outputs, 

11
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:44,620
and which you can also take a derivative of.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,270
Basically what it means to have a derivative in this context is that when you zoom 

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,361
in to how the function behaves near a given point, to the point and its neighbors, 

14
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:57,600
it looks roughly like scaling and rotating, like multiplying by some complex constant.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,015
We'll talk more about that in just a bit, but for now know that 

16
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,834
it includes most of the ordinary functions you could write down, 

17
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,740
things like polynomials, exponentials, trig functions, all of that.

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,965
The relevant dynamics in the title here comes from asking what happens when 

19
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:15,525
you repeatedly apply one of these functions over and over, 

20
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:20,110
in the sense of evaluating on some input, then evaluating the same function 

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,360
on whatever you just got out, and then doing that again, and again and again and again.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,885
Sometimes the pattern of points emerging from this gets trapped in a cycle, 

23
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:34,700
other times the sequence will just approach some kind of limiting point.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,228
Or maybe the sequence gets bigger and bigger and it flies off to infinity, 

25
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:42,624
which mathematicians also kind of think of as approaching a limit point, 

26
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:43,880
just the point at infinity.

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,860
And other times still they have no pattern at all, and they behave chaotically.

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,628
What's surprising is that for all sorts of functions that you might write down, 

29
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:59,198
when you try to do something to visualize when these different possible behaviors arise, 

30
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:02,280
it often results in some insanely intricate fractal pattern.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,900
Those of you who watched the last video have already seen one neat example of this.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,986
There's this algorithm called Newton's method, which finds the root of some polynomial p, 

33
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:15,705
and the way it works is to basically repeatedly iterate the expression x 

34
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:19,120
minus p of x divided by p prime of x, p prime being the derivative.

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,126
When your initial seed value is in the loose vicinity of a root to that polynomial, 

36
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:27,663
a value where p of x equals zero, this procedure produces a sequence 

37
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:30,380
of values that really quickly converges to that root.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,620
This is what makes it a useful algorithm in practice.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,134
But then we tried to do this in the complex plane, 

40
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:39,108
looking at the many possible seed values and asking which 

41
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,800
root in the complex plane each one of these seed values might end up on.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,024
Then we associated a color with one of the roots, 

43
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:50,744
and then colored each pixel of the plane based on which root a seed value starting at 

44
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,720
that pixel would ultimately land on.

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,804
The results we got were some of these insanely intricate pictures, 

46
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:59,320
with these rough fractal boundaries between the colors.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,196
Now in this example, if you look at the function that we're actually iterating, 

48
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:09,797
say for some specific choice of a polynomial, like z cubed minus one, 

49
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:14,120
you can rewrite the whole expression to look like one polynomial divided by another.

50
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,040
Mathematicians call these kinds of functions rational functions.

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,635
And if you forget the fact that this arose from Newton's method, 

52
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:25,460
you could reasonably ask what happens when you iterate any other rational function.

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,370
And in fact, this is exactly what the mathematicians Pierre Fatou 

54
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,720
and Gaston Julia did in the years immediately following World War I.

55
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,590
And they built up a surprisingly rich theory of what happens when you 

56
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,230
iterate these rational functions, which is particularly impressive given 

57
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,920
that they had no computers to visualize any of this the way you and I can.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,380
Remember those two names, they'll come up a bit later.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,097
By far the most popularized example of a rational function that you 

60
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,340
might study like this, and the fractals that can ensue, 

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,800
is one of the simplest functions, z squared plus c, where c is some constant.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,164
I'm going to guess that this is at least somewhat familiar to many of you, 

63
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:06,098
but it certainly doesn't hurt to quickly summarize the story here, 

64
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,420
since it can help set the stage for what comes later.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,680
For this game, we're going to think of c as a value that can be changed.

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,560
It'll be visible as this movable yellow dot.

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,087
For the actual iterative process, we will always 

68
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:21,740
start with an initial value of z equals zero.

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,240
So after iterating this function once, doing z squared plus c, you get c.

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,923
If you iterate a second time, plugging in that value to the function, 

71
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,360
you get c squared plus c.

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,679
And as I change around the value c here, you can kind of see how the third 

73
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:47,400
value to get z4 and continue on like this, visualizing our chain of values.

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,914
So if I keep doing this many different times for the first many values, 

75
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:56,800
for some choices of c, this process remains bounded.

76
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,560
You can still see it all on the screen.

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,836
And other times, it looks like it blows up, and you can actually 

78
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:04,400
show that if it gets as big as 2, it'll blow up to infinity.

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,693
If you color the points of the plane where it stays bounded black, 

80
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:16,897
and you assign some other gradient of colors to the divergent values based on how quickly 

81
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:22,101
the process rushes off to infinity, you get one of the most iconic images in all of math, 

82
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:23,200
the Mandelbrot set.

83
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,695
Now this interactive dots and stick visualization of the trajectory, 

84
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,786
by the way, is heavily inspired by Ben Sparks' illustration and the 

85
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,740
Numberphile video he did about the Mandelbrot set, which is great, you should watch it.

86
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,734
I honestly thought it was just too fun not to read about all of this 

87
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:44,640
stuff for any of you who haven't had the pleasure of reading that yet.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,292
What's nice about the Ben Sparks illustration is how it illuminates 

89
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,300
what each different part of the Mandelbrot set actually represents.

90
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,100
This largest cardioid section includes the values of c 

91
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,140
so that the process eventually converges to some limit.

92
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,700
The big circle on the left represents the values where 

93
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,460
the process gets trapped in a cycle between two values.

94
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,450
And then the top and bottom circles show values where the process 

95
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,380
gets trapped in a cycle of three values, and so on like this.

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,720
Each one of these little islands kind of has its own meaning.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,240
Also notice there's an important difference between how this 

98
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,291
Mandelbrot set and the Newton fractals we were looking at before are each constructed, 

99
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,340
beyond just a different underlying function.

100
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,026
For the Mandelbrot set we have a consistent seed value, z equals zero, 

101
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:34,340
but the thing we're tweaking is the parameter c, changing the function itself.

102
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,500
So what you're looking at is a parameter space.

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,683
But with Newton's fractal, we have a single unchanging function, 

104
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:46,020
but what we associate with each pixel is a different seed value for the process.

105
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,560
Of course, we could play the same game with the map z squared plus c.

106
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,905
We could fix c at some constant, and then let the pixels 

107
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:56,800
represent the different possible initial values, z naught.

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,439
So whereas each pixel of the Mandelbrot set corresponds to a unique function, 

109
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,620
the images on the right each just correspond to a single function.

110
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,220
As we change the parameter c, it changes the entire image on the right.

111
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,937
And again, just to be clear, the rule being applied is that we color pixels 

112
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:17,958
black if the process remains bounded, and then apply some kind of gradient to 

113
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:22,340
the ones that diverge away to infinity based on how quickly they diverge to infinity.

114
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,475
In principle, and it's kind of mind-warping to think about, 

115
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:30,395
there is some four-dimensional space of all combinations of c and z naught, 

116
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:34,883
and what we're doing here is kind of looking through individual two-dimensional slices 

117
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:36,380
of that unimaginable pattern.

118
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,276
You'll often hear or read the images on the right being referred to as 

119
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:45,111
Julia sets or Julia fractals, and when I first learned about all this stuff, 

120
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,647
I'll admit that I kind of was left with the misconception that this is 

121
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:52,382
what the term Julia set refers to, specifically the z squared plus c case, 

122
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:55,720
and moreover that it's referring to the black region on the inside.

123
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,399
However, the term Julia set has a much more general definition, 

124
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,960
and it would refer just to the boundaries of these regions, not the interior.

125
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,121
To set the stage for a more specific definition, 

126
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,930
and to also make some headway towards the first goal that I mentioned at the start, 

127
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,011
it's worth stepping back and really just picturing yourself as a mathematician right now, 

128
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:15,100
discovering all of this.

129
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,880
What would you actually do to construct a theory around this?

130
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,680
It's one thing to look at some pretty pictures, 

131
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,060
but what sorts of questions would you ask if you understand it all?

132
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,800
In general, if you want to understand something complicated, 

133
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,946
a good place to start is to ask if there are any parts of the system 

134
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:35,320
that have some simple behavior, preferably the simplest possible behavior.

135
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,400
In our example, that might mean asking when does the process just stay fixed in place, 

136
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,140
meaning f of z is equal to z.

137
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,880
That's a pretty boring set of dynamics, I think you'd agree.

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,680
We call a value with this property a fixed point of the function.

139
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,033
In the case of the functions arising from Newton's method, 

140
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,240
by design they have a fixed point at the roots of the relevant polynomial.

141
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,140
You can verify for yourself, if p of z is equal to zero, 

142
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,920
then the entire expression is simply equal to z.

143
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,660
That's what it means to be a fixed point.

144
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,264
If you're into exercises, you may enjoy pausing for a moment and computing the 

145
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:19,800
fixed points of this Mandelbrot set since asking when this expression equals 

146
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,420
z can always be rearranged as finding the roots of some polynomial expression.

147
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,430
From the fundamental theorem of algebra, this must have solutions, 

148
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,820
typically as many solutions as the highest degree in this expression.

149
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,438
Incidentally, this means you could also find those fixed points using Newton's method, 

150
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:41,600
but maybe that's a little too meta for us.

151
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,152
Just asking about fixed points is easy, but a key idea for understanding the full 

152
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:51,720
dynamics, and hence the diagrams that we're looking at, is to understand stability.

153
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,698
We say that a fixed point is attracting if nearby points tend to get drawn in towards it, 

154
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,680
and repelling if they're pushed away.

155
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,803
And this is something that you can actually compute 

156
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,040
explicitly using the derivative of the function.

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,099
Symbolically, when you take derivatives of complex functions, 

158
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,960
it looks exactly the same as it would for real functions, 

159
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,020
though something like z squared has a derivative of 2 times z.

160
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,020
But geometrically, there's a really lovely way to interpret what this means.

161
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,505
For example, at the input 1, the derivative of this particular function evaluates to be 

162
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:29,162
2, and what that's telling us is that if you look at a very small neighborhood around 

163
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:33,981
that input, and you follow what happens to all the points in that little neighborhood as 

164
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:36,580
you apply the function, in this case z squared, 

165
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,180
then it looks just like you're multiplying by 2.

166
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,400
This is what a derivative of 2 means.

167
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,900
To take another example, let's look at the input i.

168
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,860
We know that this function moves that input to the value negative 1, that's i squared.

169
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,323
But the added information that its derivative at this value is 2 times i gives us the 

170
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,356
added picture that when you zoom in around that point, 

171
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:03,217
and you look at the action of the function on this tiny neighborhood, 

172
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:07,850
it looks like multiplication by 2i, which in this case is saying it looks like a 90 

173
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,160
degree rotation combined with an expansion by a factor of 2.

174
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,594
For the purposes of analyzing stability, the only thing 

175
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,280
we care about here is the growing and shrinking factor.

176
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,040
The rotational part doesn't matter.

177
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,049
So if you compute the derivative of a function at its fixed point, 

178
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:28,894
and the absolute value of this result is less than 1, 

179
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:31,476
it tells you that the fixed point is attracting, 

180
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:33,900
that nearby points tend to come in towards it.

181
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,985
If that derivative has an absolute value bigger than 1, 

182
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:40,360
it tells you the fixed point is repelling, it pushes away its neighbors.

183
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,474
For example, if you work out the derivative of our Newton's map expression, 

184
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:49,360
and you simplify a couple things a little bit, here's what you would get out.

185
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,020
So if z is a fixed point, which in this context means that it's one of the roots 

186
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,660
of the polynomial p, this derivative is not only smaller than 1, it's equal to 0.

187
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,470
These are sometimes called super-attracting fixed points, 

188
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,008
since it means that a neighborhood around these points doesn't merely shrink, 

189
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:07,780
it shrinks a lot.

190
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,868
And again, this is kind of by design, since the intent of Newton's method 

191
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:17,020
is to produce iterations that fall towards a root as quickly as they can.

192
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,147
Pulling up our z squared plus c example, if you did the first 

193
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:24,476
exercise to find its fixed points, the next step would be to ask, 

194
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:27,200
when is at least one of those fixed points attracting?

195
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,100
For what values of c is this going to be true?

196
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,519
And then, if that's not enough of a challenge, 

197
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,108
try using the result that you find to show that this condition corresponds to the main 

198
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,060
cardioid shape of the Mandelbrot set.

199
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,400
This is something you can compute explicitly, it's pretty cool.

200
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,469
A natural next step would be to ask about cycles, 

201
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,920
and this is where things really start to get interesting.

202
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,691
If f of z is not z but some other value, and then that value comes back to z, 

203
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,560
it means that you've fallen into a two cycle.

204
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,842
You could explicitly find these kinds of two cycles by 

205
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:06,300
evaluating f of f of z and then setting it equal to z.

206
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,700
For example, with the z squared plus c map, f of f of z expands out to look like this.

207
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,080
A little messy, but you know, it's not too terrible.

208
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,380
The main thing to highlight is that it boils down to solving some degree four equation.

209
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,282
You should note though that the fixed points will also be solutions to this equation, 

210
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:27,446
so technically the two cycles are the solutions to this minus the 

211
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:29,700
solutions to the original fixed point equation.

212
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,936
And likewise you can use the same idea to look for 

213
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:36,960
n cycles by composing f with itself n different times.

214
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,922
The explicit expressions that you would get quickly become insanely messy, 

215
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:46,288
but it's still elucidating to ask how many cycles would you expect based on this 

216
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:47,420
hypothetical process.

217
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,538
If we stick with our simple z squared plus c example, as you compose it with itself, 

218
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:56,847
you'd get a polynomial with degree four and then one with degree eight and then 

219
00:13:56,847 --> 00:14:01,480
degree sixteen and so on and so on, exponentially growing the order of the polynomial.

220
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,984
So in principle, if I asked you how many cycles are there with a period of one million, 

221
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:10,821
you can know that it's equivalent to solving some just absolutely insane 

222
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:14,080
polynomial expression with a degree of two to the one million.

223
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,870
So again, fundamental theorem of algebra, you would expect to find something on the order 

224
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,640
of two to the one million points in the complex plane which cycle in exactly this way.

225
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,780
And more generally, for any rational map you'll always be able 

226
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,860
to find values whose behavior falls into a cycle with period n.

227
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,480
It ultimately boils down to solving some probably insane polynomial expression.

228
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,791
And just like with this example, the number of 

229
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,680
such periodic points will grow exponentially with n.

230
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,294
I didn't really talk about this in the last video about Newton's fractal, 

231
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:50,518
but it's sort of strange to think that there are infinitely many points 

232
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:53,340
that fall into some kind of cycle even for a process like this.

233
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,403
In almost all cases though, these points are somewhere on the boundary 

234
00:14:57,403 --> 00:15:00,406
between those colored regions and they don't really come up in 

235
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:03,600
practice because the probability of landing on one of them is zero.

236
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,830
What matters for actually falling into one of these is if one of the 

237
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,525
cycles is attracting in the sense that a neighborhood of points around 

238
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:15,220
a value from that cycle would tend to get pulled in towards that cycle.

239
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,971
A highly relevant question for someone interested in numerical methods 

240
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,631
is whether or not this Newton's map process ever has an attracting cycle, 

241
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,846
because if there is it means there's a non-zero chance that your 

242
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:30,160
initial guess gets trapped in that cycle and it never finds a root.

243
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,800
The answer here is actually yes.

244
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,908
More explicitly, if you try to find the roots of z cubed minus 2z plus 

245
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:42,053
2 and you're using Newton's method, watch what happens to a cluster 

246
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:46,260
that starts around the value zero and sort of bounces back and forth.

247
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,914
And well okay, in this case the cluster we started with was a 

248
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,697
little bit too big so some of the outer points get sprayed away, 

249
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:55,480
but here's what it looks like if we start with a smaller cluster.

250
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,715
Notice how all of the points genuinely do shrink 

251
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:00,940
in towards the cycle between zero and one.

252
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,040
It's not likely that you hit this with a random seed, but it definitely is possible.

253
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,532
The exercise that you could do to verify that a cycle like this is attracting, 

254
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:14,082
by the way, would be to compute the derivative of f of f of z, 

255
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:18,760
and you check that at the input zero this derivative has a magnitude less than one.

256
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,124
The thing that blew my mind a little is what happens when you try 

257
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,540
to visualize which cubic polynomials have attracting cycles at all.

258
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,873
Hopefully if Newton's method is going to be at all decent at finding roots, 

259
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,820
those attracting cycles should be rare.

260
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,349
First of all, to better visualize the one example we're looking at, 

261
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:39,891
we could draw the same fractal that we had before, 

262
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:43,728
coloring each point based on what root the seed value starting at that point 

263
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:47,566
will tend to, but this time we'll have an added condition of coloring points 

264
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:51,304
that says that if the seed value never gets close enough to a root at all, 

265
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:52,800
we will color the pixel black.

266
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,520
Notice if I tweak the roots, meaning that we're trying out different cubic polynomials, 

267
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,712
it's actually really hard to find any place to put them so 

268
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,660
that we see any black pixels at all.

269
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,660
I can find this one little sweet spot here, but it's definitely rare.

270
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,132
Now what I want is some kind of way to visualize every possible cubic polynomial 

271
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,640
at once with a single image in a way that shows which ones have attracting cycles.

272
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,618
Luckily it turns out that there is a really simple way to test 

273
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:24,400
whether or not one of these polynomials has an attracting cycle.

274
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,031
All you have to do is look at the seed value which sits at average of the three roots, 

275
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:31,460
this center of mass here.

276
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,741
Turns out, this is not at all obvious, if there's an attracting cycle, 

277
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:39,640
you can guarantee that this seed value will fall into that attracting cycle.

278
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,420
In other words, if there are any black points, this will be one of them.

279
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,102
If you want to know where this magical fact comes from, 

280
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:50,520
it stems from a theorem of our good friend Fatou.

281
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,610
He showed that if one of these rational maps has an attracting cycle, 

282
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,196
you can look at the values where the derivative of your iterated function equals zero, 

283
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:02,360
and at least one of those values has to fall into the cycle.

284
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,933
That might seem like a little bit of a weird fact, 

285
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:09,356
but the loose intuition is that if a cycle is going to be attracting, 

286
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,486
at least one of its values should have a very small derivative, 

287
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,540
that's where the shrinking will come from.

288
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,443
And this in turn means that that value in the cycle sits near some 

289
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:21,736
point where the derivative is not merely small but equal to zero, 

290
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:25,280
and that point ends up being close enough to get sucked into the cycle.

291
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,256
This fact also justifies why with the Mandelbrot set, 

292
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:31,903
where we're only using one seed value z equals zero, 

293
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,100
it's still enough to get us a very full and interesting picture.

294
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,600
If there's a stable cycle to be found, that one seed value is definitely going to find it.

295
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,730
I feel like maybe I'm assigning a little too much homework and exercises today, 

296
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,696
but if you're into that, yet another pleasing one would be to look back at 

297
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:54,349
derivative expression that we found with our function that arises from Newton's method, 

298
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:58,579
and use this wonderful theorem of Vateau's to show our magical fact about cubic 

299
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:02,440
polynomials, that it suffices to just check this midpoint over the roots.

300
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,540
Honestly though, all of those are details that you don't really have to worry about.

301
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,026
The upshot is that we can perform a test for whether or not one of these polynomials 

302
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,720
has an attracting cycle by looking at just a single point, not all of them.

303
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,600
And because of this, we can actually generate a really cool diagram.

304
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,005
The way this will work is to fix two roots in place, 

305
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:25,720
let's say putting them at z equals negative one and z equals positive one, 

306
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,040
and then we'll move around that third root, which I'll call lambda.

307
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,820
Remember, the key feature that we're looking for 

308
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,160
is when the point at the center of mass is black.

309
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,188
So what I'll do is draw a second diagram on the right, 

310
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:42,940
where each pixel corresponds to one possible choice of lambda.

311
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,230
What we're going to do is color that pixel based 

312
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,600
on the color of this midpoint of the three roots.

313
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,160
If this feels a little bit confusing, that's totally okay.

314
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,440
There are kind of a lot of layers at play here.

315
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,138
Just remember, each pixel on the right corresponds to a unique polynomial, 

316
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,280
as determined by this parameter lambda.

317
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,740
In fact, you might call this a parameter space.

318
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,580
Sound familiar?

319
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,801
Points in this parameter space are colored black if, and only if, 

320
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:23,340
the Newton's method process for the corresponding polynomial produces an attracting cycle.

321
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,400
Again, don't worry if that takes a little moment to digest.

322
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,277
Now, at first glance, it might not look like there 

323
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,380
are any black points at all on this diagram.

324
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,780
And this is good news.

325
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,300
It means that in most cases Newton's method will not get sucked into cycles like this.

326
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,810
But, and I think I've previewed this enough that you know exactly where this is going, 

327
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,349
if we zoom in we can find a black region, and that black region 

328
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,340
looks exactly like a Mandelbrot set.

329
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,562
Yet again, asking a question where we tweak a parameter for one 

330
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:57,160
of these functions yields this iconic cardioid and bubbles shape.

331
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,411
The upshot is that this shape is not as specific 

332
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:02,900
to the z squared plus c example as you might think.

333
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,165
It seems to relate to something more general and 

334
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,440
universal about parameter spaces with processes like this.

335
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,520
Still, one pressing question is why we get fractals at all.

336
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,460
In the last video, I talked about how the diagrams for Newton's method have this 

337
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,753
very peculiar property, where if you draw a small circle around the boundary of a 

338
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:29,360
colored region, that circle must actually include all available colors from the picture.

339
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,740
And this is true more generally for any rational map.

340
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,141
If you were to assign colors to regions based on which limiting behavior 

341
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:41,143
points fall into, like which limit point or which limit cycle or does it 

342
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:45,364
tend to infinity, then tiny circles that you draw either contain points with 

343
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:49,640
just one of those limiting behaviors, or they contain points with all of them.

344
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,200
It's never anything in between.

345
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,578
So in the case where there's at least three colors, 

346
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:57,750
this property implies that our boundary could never be smooth, 

347
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,678
since along a smooth segment, you can draw a small enough circle that touches 

348
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:03,340
just two colors, not all of them.

349
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
And empirically, this is what we see.

350
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,360
No matter how far you zoom in, these boundaries are always rough.

351
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,623
And furthermore, you might notice that as we zoom in, 

352
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,520
you can always see all available colors within the frame.

353
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,409
This doesn't explain rough boundaries in the context where there's only two limiting 

354
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:24,460
behaviors, but still, it's a loose end that I left in that video worth tying up, 

355
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,960
and it's a nice excuse to bring in two important bits of terminology, 

356
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,260
Julia sets and Fatou sets.

357
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,571
If a point eventually falls into some stable, predictable pattern, 

358
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:37,040
we say that it's part of the Fatou set of our iterated function.

359
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,860
And for all the maps that we've seen, this includes almost everything.

360
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,062
The Julia set is everything else, which in the pictures we've 

361
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:48,540
seen would be the rough boundaries between the colored regions.

362
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,340
What happens as you transition from one stable attractor to another?

363
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,554
For example, the Julia set will include all of 

364
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:58,160
the repelling cycles and the repelling fixed points.

365
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,800
A typical point from the Julia set though, will not be a cycle.

366
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,340
It'll bounce around forever with no clear pattern.

367
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,867
Now, if you look at a point in the Fatou set, and you draw a small enough disc around it, 

368
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:13,124
as you follow the process, that small disc will eventually shrink as 

369
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,720
you fall into whatever the relevant stable behavior is.

370
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,110
Unless you're going to infinity, but you could kind of think of that as 

371
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,020
the disc shrinking around infinity, but maybe that just confuses matters.

372
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,318
By contrast, if you draw a small disc around a point on the Julia set, 

373
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:33,105
it tends to expand over time as the points from within that circle go off and kind of do 

374
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:34,020
their own things.

375
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
In other words, points of the Julia set tend to behave chaotically.

376
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,466
Their nearby neighbors, even very nearby, will 

377
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:45,260
eventually fall into qualitatively different behaviors.

378
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,840
But it's not merely that this disc expands.

379
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,458
A pretty surprising result, key to the multicolor property mentioned before, 

380
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:57,769
is that if you let this process play out, that little disc eventually expands so 

381
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,400
much that it hits every single point on the complex plane, with at most two exceptions.

382
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,880
This is known as the stuff-goes-everywhere principle of Julia sets.

383
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,360
Okay, it's not actually called that.

384
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,769
In the source I was reading from, it's mentioned as 

385
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,800
a corollary to something known as Montel's theorem.

386
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,700
But it should be called that.

387
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,170
In some sense, what this is telling us is that the points of the Julia set 

388
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,220
are not merely chaotic, they're kind of as chaotic as they possibly can be.

389
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,333
Here, let me show you a little simulation using the Newton's map, 

390
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,701
with a cluster of a few thousand points, all starting from within a tiny distance, 

391
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:36,280
one one-millionth, from a point on the Julia set.

392
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,175
Of course, the stuff-goes-everywhere principle is about the uncountably 

393
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,088
infinitely many points that would lie within that distance, 

394
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,389
and that they eventually expand out to hit everything on the plane, 

395
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:53,700
except possibly two points.

396
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,780
But this little cluster should still give the general idea.

397
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,585
A small, finite sample from that tiny disk gets 

398
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:02,800
sprayed all over the place in seemingly all directions.

399
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,704
What this means for our purposes is that if there's some attractive behavior of our map, 

400
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:11,848
something like an attracting fixed point or an attracting cycle, 

401
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:15,815
you can be guaranteed that the values from that tiny disk around the point on the 

402
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:20,120
Julia set, no matter how tiny it was, will eventually fall into that attracting behavior.

403
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,832
If we have a case with three or more attracting behaviors, 

404
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:27,258
this gives us some explanation for why the Julia set is not smooth, 

405
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,720
why it has to be complicated.

406
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,739
Even still, this might not be entirely satisfying because it kicks 

407
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,571
the can one more step down the road, raising the question of why 

408
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,360
this stuff-goes-everywhere principle is true in the first place.

409
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,237
Like I mentioned, it comes from something called Montel's theorem, 

410
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:46,300
and I'm choosing not to go into the details there, because honestly, it's a lot to cover.

411
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,288
The proof I could find ends up leaning on something known as the J function, 

412
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:52,540
which is a whole intricate story in its own right.

413
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,667
I will of course leave links and resources in the 

414
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,760
description for any of you who are hungry to learn more.

415
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,513
And if you know of a simpler way to see why this principle is true, 

416
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:01,640
I'm definitely all ears.

417
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,175
I should also say as a brief side note that even though the pictures we've seen 

418
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:08,582
so far have a Julia set which has an area of zero, 

419
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,895
it's kind of the boundary between these regions, 

420
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:13,680
there are examples where the Julia set is the entire plane.

421
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,800
Everything behaves chaotically, which is kind of wild.

422
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,750
The main takeaway for this particular section 

423
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,320
is the link between the chaos and the fractal.

424
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,680
At first it seems like these are merely analogous to each other.

425
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,248
Newton's method turns out to be a kind of messy process for some seed values, 

426
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:35,935
and this messiness is visible one way by following the trajectory of a particular point, 

427
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:38,621
and another way by the complexity of our diagrams, 

428
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:41,940
but those feel like qualitatively different kinds of messiness.

429
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,640
Maybe it makes for a nice metaphor, but nothing more.

430
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,068
However, what's neat here is that when you quantify just how chaotic 

431
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:52,980
some of the points are, well, that quantification leads us to an actual 

432
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,620
explanation for the rough fractal shape via this boundary property.

433
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,224
Quite often you see chaos and fractals sort of married together in math, 

434
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:04,710
and to me at least it's satisfying whenever that marriage comes with a 

435
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,540
logical link to it, rather than as two phenomena that just happen to coincide.
