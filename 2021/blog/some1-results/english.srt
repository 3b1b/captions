00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
This summer, James Schloss and I ran a contest that's meant to encourage more people to make

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,080
online math explainers, and here I want to share with you some of my favorites.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,960
I wrote up a much fuller blog post about the event and the process for selecting winners,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,520
but let's open here with some of the key points.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,240
First of all, it was extremely open-ended. It's meant for math explainers of any kind,

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
any medium, any target audience, any topic, pretty much just as long as it's about math.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,640
The promise was to select around 4-5 to be winners, which I would then feature in a video,

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,280
here we are now, and after I made the initial announcement, Brilliant came in and kindly

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,360
offered cash prizes to those winners. Before anything, let me just emphasize

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
this notion of a winner should really be taken with a heavy grain of salt.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,520
The spirit of the event, and hopefully this is obvious, is to get more people sharing

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,400
their knowledge, and preferably to have them do so in a way that's as engaging and empathetic

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,200
and novel as possible. The way I see it, there's some benefits to framing it as a contest,

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,000
like we have a clear deadline, and that can be a great cure for perfectionism and stagnation.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Also, having some small stakes involved hopefully means that the lessons are put together with a

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,800
little bit more care, and with a little bit more attention to the kind of principles that

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,840
I wanted to emphasize with the whole event. The downside, which is not to be taken lightly,

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,360
is that it gives the false impression that success looks like winning, but it does not.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,920
Success means having more material out there that explains math and inspires people to engage with

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,400
it. Ten years from now, no one is going to remember my arbitrary selections, but every

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
one of the pieces made will still exist and will still potentially help someone trying to learn.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,320
We received over 1200 submissions, and as a first pass for the judgment we had a peer review process

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,520
to help filter that down to a little over 100 that James and I could give a really close look at.

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
We also had around half a dozen guest judges, people in the space of Math Exposition,

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,400
to help us narrow down those final judgments. Many, many thanks to those guests for being

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,480
willing to volunteer some of their time, and generally helping to ensure that any of my

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,720
subjective quirks weren't leaking too much into the final decision. Also, a million thanks to James.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,280
He really was the core organizer behind everything here, and if you participated in the event and

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,160
found it helpful, he is absolutely the one you should be thanking. As I said, there's a blog post

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,200
with more details for any of you who are curious, but right now, without further ado, let me tell you

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,600
about some outstanding math explainers made this summer that I really think you're going to enjoy.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,080
This entry, from a channel called Paralogical, opens by asking why the light reflected at the

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,160
bottom of a mug seems to form this characteristic cardioid shape. The core mathematical idea that

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
this video teaches is that of envelopes, which in short is a way to describe one curve using a

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,320
family of other curves, and what really makes the video special is not just how clearly he explains

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,680
that subject, but how tangible and well-chosen the examples are, all delivered with a tone that's

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
just plain friendly and enjoyable to listen to. The key formula he builds up to is really well

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,960
motivated, and one of those things that would not be obvious if you just saw it out of context,

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,120
and he gives the tools for any curious viewer to pause and work through for themselves a more

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,600
detailed understanding, while still leaving room for someone watching to get the general idea and

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,760
the core points without necessarily being bogged down into that algebra. On the topic of fun ways

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,720
that light gets redirected, another one of my picks is just an absolutely mind-blowing piece

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,160
of engineering wizardry. This one is a blog post, it's written by Matt Ferraro, where he explains

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,960
how he made this acrylic square. It might look innocent at first, like nothing more than a

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,240
transparent square, maybe suspiciously wavy, but when you look at its shadow you can see that it's

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,480
been carefully crafted to redirect light in such a way as to form a highly deliberate image. The

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
post walks through all of the math and the algorithms involved in pulling this off,

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
including certain false starts in the discovery process, which I love, and the author skillfully

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,520
draws the reader's attention to which details are important and deserve more of your focus,

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,400
and which ones are more side notes and minutiae. I found myself a little surprised about what parts

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
of the process turned out to be hard and which ones were easy, and by the end the whole task

52
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,120
felt a lot less mysterious while still commanding no shortage of respect for the fact that someone

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,440
was actually able to pull it off. The next pick I have on my list here I'll be honest I felt a

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,160
little torn about. I wouldn't be surprised if many of you have already seen this video, it's called

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,320
The Beauty of BÃ©zier Curves by Freya Homare. Now, given the spirit of the contest, which is to

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
encourage people to share their knowledge without necessarily getting intimidated by a need for high

57
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
production quality, you know, focus on the quality of the lesson more so than the medium used to

58
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,240
express it, this video was so beautifully produced I almost felt like choosing it risks

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,000
sending the wrong message. Also, part of the goal here is to shine a light on comparatively unknown

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,920
creators, and by the time I was watching this one it had around 400,000 views. But the thing is,

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,560
Freya's video really is a fantastic piece of exposition, and it would be a little bit silly

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,520
of me to fault it for also being beautiful and evidently also being appreciated by many people

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,400
in both respects. I do want to be clear, the reason that I'm choosing it is not because of

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,240
the smooth graphics, it's that here we have someone who uses a certain mathematical tool regularly in

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,200
her work, and she has the ability to clearly motivate why you should care too, and to go into

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,080
the details of how it works, the many different facets of how she uses it, how she thinks about it,

67
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
and what makes it visually great is not so much the smoothness of the graphics or the aesthetic

68
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
appeal, it's that they're clean and to the point, serving to aid what's the core value in the whole

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,280
a series of well-chosen intuitions and applications of a topic in math that deserves to be known by

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,520
more people. After that one I really did think that with my other picks I could help direct the

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
audience of this channel to some excellent lessons that you might not have seen yet,

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,400
like with the next one I chose. When I saw it, it had a couple hundred views, and I really loved it,

73
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
and I was excited to share it with you all. But then it looks like the internet kind of beat me

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,080
to it. This thing is quickly going on a million views, well deserved by the way. If you haven't

75
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,480
seen it, it really is delightful. It's not a traditional math lesson in the sense of explaining

76
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,960
some topic that you might need to learn for a course, or even one that exists in a clear field,

77
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,600
for that matter, but it absolutely captures the spirit of mathematical discovery.

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,520
The question posed in the video seems a little bit silly at first, which is what's the most

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,160
complicated passcode for those sorts of swipey swipey pattern passcodes that some phones have.

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
The video opens by making that question rigorous, giving it a solid definition,

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,000
and then proceeds with a really engaging story of problem solving that involves very real math

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,040
lessons along the way, things about number theory, about induction, about generalizing a result even

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,320
after you've solved a sub-problem. Definitely take a look. The final pick I have on my list here,

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,120
which again is in no particular order, is one that multiple different guest judges singled out

85
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,960
as being especially good, and also easily underappreciated. The video describes a really

86
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,080
clever and memorable proof of this cute fact from geometry known as Pick's Theorem. And more than

87
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,320
that, the author has some really nice thoughts about the role of different kinds of proofs in

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,720
math, thoughts which more students, and for that matter more teachers, would really benefit from

89
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,720
hearing and thinking about. It's no fancier than it needs to be, but the core idea is just so good

90
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,040
that to me at least the video has a lot more staying power than many of the professionally

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,640
produced educational videos that I've seen from established channels out there.

92
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,440
So there you go, those are my five picks for this summer of Math Exposition. But the thing is,

93
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,320
if you had seen the submissions that I have seen, you would agree that choosing just five winners

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,800
is ridiculous, to the point of absurdity. Again, you know, the point is not the winners,

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
the event is about encouraging people to follow through with projects, things about

96
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,880
Math Exposition they might have been thinking about doing, all of that. But just reiterating

97
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,840
that point feels a little bit hollow, because there are at least, I don't know, 20 in here,

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,680
where I feel like it is a genuine crime not to have chosen them. And, well you know, it's my contest,

99
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,400
my rules, so if you'll indulge me, let me quickly tell you about some others that I just loved.

100
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,360
One that I think viewers of this channel would especially enjoy is almost an hour. It's about

101
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,320
Duroc's belt trick by Noah Miller. In a recent event that I was doing with Stephen Strogatz for

102
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,880
the MoMath Museum, we had a call that was ostensibly meant to prepare for that event,

103
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,760
but instead we spent much of it just both gushing over how much we liked this one particular video.

104
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,080
Any of you who have flirted with this topic will probably know how tricky it can be to understand

105
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,000
the link between points on a 4D sphere and rotations in 3D space, and why any of that has

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,120
to do with quantum mechanics, but this animated hour-long lecture does a really good job laying

107
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,360
out the full story. Another one which is long but good is about the unsolvability of the quintic by

108
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Carl Turner. For me it was a bit bizarre seeing it, because when I did I was actively working on

109
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,080
a video that was not just about the same theorem, but about the same comparatively esoteric proof

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,640
that it describes there. I thought the video did such a wonderful job I just kind of set aside the

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,800
project. I'll still probably cover it at some point, but now I'm motivated to do it in a

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,520
different way, but in the meantime any of you curious about why quintic polynomials are in

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,880
a certain sense unsolvable will absolutely love this video. So many entries here were just really

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,000
solid explainers, plain and simple. This includes the best overview I've seen of the two-envelope

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,880
problem, a great explanation for how fonts get turned into pixels, a wonderful article on

116
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,320
spinners, a comic style blog post about E, a video about an ancient Babylonian algorithm for

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
multiplying numbers which has unexpected usefulness for certain programming tasks.

118
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,600
There were a number of videos in Chinese on the site Bilibili, including one I really liked about

119
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,080
a fundamental theorem for symmetric polynomials, perfectly understandable with the English subtitles.

120
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,480
And one absolutely fantastic video in here was about lemur factor stencils, which I had never

121
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,840
heard of, and I learned a ton watching this and found it absolutely fascinating. Many of the

122
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,440
entries I saw had excellent aha moments, like this one here with a mildly clickbaity title

123
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
about a graph that will blow your mind, but the thing is, at least in my experience, that title

124
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,440
is 100% accurate. There's a video explaining why pi shows up in the bouffant needle problem with

125
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,400
a really elegant shift in perspective, and what I especially appreciate is that the author also has

126
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,480
an appendix video going through some of the more technical details not covered in the main video.

127
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,200
A few entries were highly interesting if for no other reason, just from a technological

128
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,880
standpoint alone, including a very well-executed interactive video by Rob Schlub, which let me tell

129
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,000
you is not easy to pull off, as well as a great interactive article introducing complex numbers

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
and the fundamental theorem of algebra on the site Trina. And then some of the entries,

131
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,440
setting aside all the explanatory value, were just plain beautiful. Like if I had a category here for

132
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,480
greatest style, I think my pick would be this one about recreating curves from a children's toy.

133
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,640
But setting aside style, or the core point of all of this, which is the explanatory quality,

134
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,960
there's one feature of online explainers that can easily be underappreciated, which is the role of

135
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,240
narrative and storylines. And a couple entries I think did a great job exemplifying that component.

136
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,320
This includes not one, but two entries on this game called Hackenbush, a story about how a

137
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
lights-out puzzle can lead you to Gaussian elimination, a nice exploration of the most

138
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,680
efficient way to choose a random point in a circle uniformly, a great puzzle about tiles,

139
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,560
which carries with it explanations of core facts from Fibonacci numbers, and one really nicely done

140
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,560
video about why the Sierpinski triangle shows up in three seemingly completely unrelated contexts.

141
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,840
Again, the list goes on for quite a while. As I look at some of these now, I'm really pleased to

142
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,520
see that a lot of them have picked up some traction on YouTube, but there still remain

143
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,560
many which are very underappreciated. I highly encourage you to go to the playlist, including

144
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
all the video submissions, and to check out the blog post featuring all other submissions.

145
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,320
As you look at that playlist, I would not read into the order of it too much,

146
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,560
it was generated programmatically, but I did try to go through and curate the first few ones with

147
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,880

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,080

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,960
do, I can almost guarantee that you have hours of edification waiting ahead of you, not to mention

150
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,840
hours of just pure delight. Thanks again to everyone who participated. Let me just say

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,360
one more time, I really was blown away by the quality here.
