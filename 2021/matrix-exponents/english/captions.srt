00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,874
Let me pull out an old differential equations textbook that I learned from in college, 

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:09,188
and let's turn to this funny little exercise in here that asks the reader to 

3
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:13,222
compute E to the power a t, where a we're told is going to be a matrix, 

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:17,200
and the insinuation seems to be that the results will also be a matrix.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,280
It then offers several examples for what you might plug in for a.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,746
Now, taking out a context, putting a matrix into an exponent like this 

7
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:29,400
probably seems like total nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely 

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,400
beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up in this book is that it's useful.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,080
It's used to solve a very important class of differential equations.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,709
In turn, given that the universe is often written in the language of differential 

11
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,569
equations, you see this pop up in physics all the time too, 

12
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:48,860
especially in quantum mechanics, where matrix exponents are littered throughout the place.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,800
They play a particularly prominent role.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,128
This has a lot to do with Schrodinger's equation, which we'll touch on a bit later, 

15
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:58,739
and it may also help in understanding your romantic relationships, but again, 

16
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,480
all in due time.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,967
A big part of the reason I want to cover this topic is that there is an 

18
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,563
extremely nice way to visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing 

19
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:15,322
using flow that not a lot of people seem to talk about, 

20
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,919
but for the bulk of this chapter, let's start by laying out what exactly 

21
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:22,565
the operation is, and see if we can get a feel for what kinds of problems 

22
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:23,600
it helps us to solve.

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,990
The first thing you should know is that this is not some 

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,280
bizarre way to multiply the constant e by itself multiple times.

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,260
You would be right to call that nonsense.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,401
The actual definition is related to a certain infinite polynomial 

27
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:40,040
for describing real number powers of e, what we call its Taylor series.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,850
For example, if I took the number 2 and plugged it into this polynomial, 

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,787
then as you add more and more terms, each of which looks like some power of 2 divided by 

30
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:50,620
some factorial.

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,260
The sum approaches a number near 7.389, and this number is precisely e times e.

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,408
If you increment this input by one, then somewhat miraculously, 

33
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:09,907
no matter where you started from, the effect on the output is always to multiply it 

34
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:11,140
by another factor of e.

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,617
For reasons that you're going to see in a bit, 

36
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:18,980
mathematicians became interested in plugging all kinds of things into this polynomial, 

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,339
things like complex numbers, and for our purposes today, matrices, 

38
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:25,700
even when those objects do not immediately make sense as exponents.

39
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,470
What some authors do is give this infinite polynomial 

40
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,020
the name exp when you plug in more exotic inputs.

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,275
It's a gentle nod to the connection that this has to exponential functions in the 

42
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:40,260
case of real numbers, even though obviously these inputs don't make sense as exponents.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,593
However, an equally common convention is to give a much less gentle nod to the connection 

44
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:50,175
and just abbreviate the whole thing as e to the power of whatever object you're plugging 

45
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:54,500
in, whether that's a complex number or a matrix or all sorts of more exotic objects.

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,084
So while this equation is a theorem for real numbers, 

47
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:00,260
it's a definition for more exotic inputs.

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,900
Cynically, you could call this a blatant abuse of notation.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,220
More charitably, you might view it as an example of the 

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,720
beautiful cycle between discovery and invention in math.

51
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,635
In either case, plugging in a matrix even to a polynomial might seem a little strange, 

52
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,400
so let's be clear on what we mean here.

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,940
The matrix has to have the same number of rows and columns.

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,683
That way you can multiply it by itself according 

55
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:24,680
to the usual rules of matrix multiplication.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
This is what we mean by squaring it.

57
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,863
Similarly, if you were to take that result and then multiply it by 

58
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:35,740
the original matrix again, this is what we mean by cubing the matrix.

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,576
If you carry on like this, you can take any whole number power of a matrix, 

60
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:42,820
it's perfectly sensible.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,520
In this context, powers still mean exactly what you would expect, repeated multiplication.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,813
Each term in this polynomial is scaled by one divided by some factorial, 

63
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:02,440
and with matrices, all that means is that you multiply each component by that number.

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,520
Likewise, it always makes sense to add together two matrices, 

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,820
this is something you again do term by term.

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,305
The astute among you might ask how sensible it is to take this out to infinity, 

67
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:17,399
which would be a great question, one that I'm largely going to postpone the answer to, 

68
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,800
but I can show you one pretty fun example here now.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,220
Take this 2x2 matrix that has negative pi and pi sitting off its diagonal entries.

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,640
Let's see what the sum gives.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,449
The first term is the identity matrix, this is actually what we 

72
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,520
mean by definition when we raise a matrix to the zeroth power.

73
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,445
Then we add the matrix itself, which gives us the pi off the diagonal terms, 

74
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,224
and then add half of the matrix squared, and continuing on I'll have the 

75
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:46,158
computer keep adding more and more terms, each of which requires taking one 

76
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:50,300
more matrix product to get the new power, and then adding it to a running tally.

77
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,000
And as it keeps going, it seems to be approaching a stable value, 

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,200
which is around negative one times the identity matrix.

79
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,100
In this sense, we say the infinite sum equals that negative identity.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,233
By the end of this video, my hope is that this 

81
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,520
particular fact comes to make total sense to you.

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,315
For any of you familiar with Euler's famous identity, 

83
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:12,400
this is essentially the matrix version of that.

84
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,666
It turns out that in general, no matter what matrix you start with, 

85
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,688
as you add more and more terms, you eventually approach some stable value, 

86
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:24,120
though sometimes it can take quite a while before you get there.

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,239
Just seeing the definition like this in isolation raises all kinds of questions, 

88
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:35,134
most notably, why would mathematicians and physicists be interested 

89
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,540
in torturing their poor matrices this way?

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,500
What problems are they trying to solve?

91
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,778
And if you're anything like me, a new operation is only satisfying when 

92
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:46,119
you have a clear view of what it's trying to do, 

93
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:49,462
some sense of how to predict the output based on the input before you 

94
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:50,800
actually crunch the numbers.

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,610
How on earth could you have predicted that the matrix with pi 

96
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,900
off the diagonals results in a negative identity matrix like this?

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,380
Often in math you should view the definition not as a starting point, but as a target.

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,977
Contrary to the structure of textbooks, mathematicians do not start by making definitions 

99
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:11,720
and then listing a lot of theorems and proving them and then showing some examples.

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,220
The process of discovering math typically goes the other way around.

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,016
They start by chewing on specific problems, and then generalizing those problems, 

102
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:24,294
then coming up with constructs that might be helpful in those general cases, 

103
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:28,240
and only then do you write down a new definition, or extend an old one.

104
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,040
As to what sorts of specific examples might motivate matrix exponents, two come to mind.

105
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,500
One involving relationships, and the other quantum mechanics.

106
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,240
Let's start with relationships.

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,950
Suppose we have two lovers, let's call them Romeo and Juliet, 

108
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,134
and let's let x represent Juliet's love for Romeo, 

109
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:54,566
and y represent his love for her, both of which are going to be values 

110
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,940
that change with time.

111
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,608
This is an example we actually touched on in chapter 1, 

112
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:03,140
based on a Steven Strogatz article, but it's okay if you didn't see that.

113
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,801
The way their relationship works is that the rate at Juliet's love for Romeo changes, 

114
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:13,780
the derivative of this value, is equal to negative one times Romeo's love for her.

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,067
So in other words, when Romeo is expressing cool disinterest, 

116
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,839
that's when Juliet's feelings actually increase, 

117
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,800
whereas if he becomes too infatuated, her interest will start to fade.

118
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
Romeo, on the other hand, is the opposite.

119
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,501
The rate of change of his love is equal to the of Juliet's love, 

120
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:37,873
so while Juliet is mad at him, his affections tend to decrease, 

121
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:41,700
whereas if she loves him, that's when his feelings grow.

122
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,240
Of course, neither one of these numbers is holding still.

123
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,767
As Romeo's love increases in response to Juliet, 

124
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:52,360
her equation continues to apply and drives her love down.

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,284
Both of these equations always apply, from each infinitesimal point in time to the next, 

126
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:02,988
so every slight change to one value immediately influences the rate of change of the 

127
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:03,320
other.

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,560
This is a system of differential equations.

129
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,759
It's a puzzle, where your challenge is to find explicit functions 

130
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,520
for x of t and y of t that make both of these expressions true.

131
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,741
Now, as systems of differential equations go, this one is on the simpler side, 

132
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:23,740
enough so that many calculus students could probably just guess at an answer.

133
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,500
But keep in mind, it's not enough to find some pair of functions that makes this true.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,708
If you want to actually predict where Romeo and Juliet end up after some starting point, 

135
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,882
you have to make sure that your functions match the initial 

136
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,840
set of conditions at time t equals 0.

137
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,840
More to the point, our actual goal today is to systematically 

138
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,689
solve more general versions of this equation, without guessing and checking, 

139
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,540
and it's that question that leads us to matrix exponents.

140
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,519
Very often when you have multiple changing values like this, 

141
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,382
it's helpful to package them together as coordinates of a single point in a higher 

142
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:58,220
dimensional space.

143
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,638
So for Romeo and Juliet, think of their relationship as a point in a 2D space, 

144
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:10,920
the x-coordinate capturing Juliet's feelings, and the y-coordinate capturing Romeo's.

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,770
Sometimes it's helpful to picture this as an arrow from the origin, 

146
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,240
other times just as a point.

147
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,586
All that really matters is that it encodes two numbers, 

148
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:24,680
and moving forward we'll be writing that as a column vector.

149
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,480
And of course, this is all a function of time.

150
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,110
You might picture the rate of change of this state, 

151
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,026
the thing that packages together the derivative of x and the derivative of y, 

152
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,536
as a kind of velocity vector in this state space, 

153
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,301
something that tugs at our point in some direction and with some magnitude 

154
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,360
that indicates how quickly it's changing.

155
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,243
Remember, the rule here is that the rate of change of x is negative y, 

156
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:52,420
and the rate of change of y is x.

157
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,340
Set up as vectors like this, we could rewrite the right hand side of 

158
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,440
this equation as a product of this matrix with the original vector xy.

159
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,940
The top row encodes Juliet's rule, and the bottom row encodes Romeo's rule.

160
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,724
So what we have here is a differential equation telling us that the 

161
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:15,880
rate of change of some vector is equal to a certain matrix times itself.

162
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,338
In a moment we'll talk about how matrix exponentiation solves this kind of equation, 

163
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:27,706
but before that let me show you a simpler way that we can solve this particular system, 

164
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:31,280
one that uses pure geometry, and it helps set the stage for visualizing 

165
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,720
matrix exponents a bit later.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,380
This matrix from our system is a 90 degree rotation matrix.

167
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,437
For any of you rusty on how to think about matrices as transformations, 

168
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:45,760
there's a video all about it on this channel, a series really.

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,190
The basic idea is that when you multiply a matrix by the vector 1 0, 

170
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,188
it pulls out the first column, and similarly if you multiply it by 0 1, 

171
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,480
that pulls out the second column.

172
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,505
What this means is that when you look at a matrix, 

173
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:06,338
you can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors, 

174
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,360
known as the matrix.

175
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,812
The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling 

176
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:16,620
and adding these two basis results by that vector's coordinates.

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,241
So looking back at the matrix from our system, 

178
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:24,532
notice how from its columns we can tell it takes the first basis vector to 0 1, 

179
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:29,200
and the second to negative 1 0, hence why I'm calling it the 90 degree rotation matrix.

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,389
What it means for our equation is that it's saying wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this 

181
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,960
space, their rate of change has to look like a 90 degree rotation of this position vector.

182
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,626
The only way velocity can permanently be perpendicular to position like this is 

183
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,276
when you rotate around the origin in circular motion, 

184
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:53,104
never growing or shrinking because the rate of change has no component in the 

185
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,380
direction of the position.

186
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,434
More specifically, since the length of this velocity vector equals the 

187
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:05,069
length of the position vector, then for each unit of time, 

188
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:09,690
the distance that this covers is equal to one radius's worth of arc length 

189
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,800
along that circle.

190
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,716
In other words, it rotates at one radian per unit time, 

191
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:20,680
so in particular it would take 2 pi units of time to make a full revolution.

192
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,017
If you want to describe this kind of rotation with a formula, 

193
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:29,580
we can use a more general rotation matrix, which looks like this.

194
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,280
Again, we can read it in terms of the columns.

195
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,951
Notice how the first column tells us that it takes that first basis vector to 

196
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:43,389
cos t sin t, and the second column tells us that it takes the second basis vector 

197
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:48,760
to negative sin t cos t, both of which are consistent with rotating by t radians.

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,239
So, to solve the system, if you want to predict where Romeo and Juliet end 

199
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:58,960
up after t units of time, you can multiply this matrix by their initial state.

200
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,008
The active viewers among you might also enjoy taking a moment to pause and 

201
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:07,896
confirm that the explicit formulas you get out of this for x of t and y of 

202
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:11,940
t really do satisfy the system of differential equations that we started with.

203
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,069
The mathematician in you might wonder if it's possible to solve not just this specific 

204
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:26,000
system, but equations like it for any other matrix, no matter its coefficients.

205
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,160
To ask this question is to set yourself up to rediscover matrix exponents.

206
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,507
The main goal for today is for you to understand how this equation lets you intuitively 

207
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:41,020
picture the operation which we write as e raised to a matrix, and on the flip side, 

208
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,480
how being able to compute matrix exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation.

209
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,917
A much less whimsical example is Schrodinger's famous equation, 

210
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:54,057
which is the fundamental equation describing how systems in quantum mechanics 

211
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:54,960
change over time.

212
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,461
It looks pretty intimidating, and I mean it's quantum mechanics so of course it will, 

213
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:02,320
but it's actually not that different from the Romeo-Juliet setup.

214
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,280
This symbol here refers to a certain vector.

215
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,047
It's a vector that packages together all the information you might care 

216
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,160
about in a system, like the various particles' positions and momenta.

217
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,812
It's analogous to our simpler 2D vector that encoded 

218
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,900
all the information about Romeo and Juliet.

219
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,613
The equation says that the rate at which this state 

220
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:23,600
vector changes looks like a certain matrix times itself.

221
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,775
There are a number of things that make Schrodinger's equation notably more complicated, 

222
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:32,080
but in the back of your mind you might think of it as a target point 

223
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,385
that you and I can build up to, with simpler examples like Romeo and 

224
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:38,260
Juliet offering more friendly stepping stones along the way.

225
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,610
Actually the simplest example, which is tied to ordinary real number powers of e, 

226
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,000
is the one-dimensional case.

227
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,740
This is when you have a single changing value, 

228
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,580
and its rate of change equals some constant times itself.

229
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,440
So the bigger the value, the faster it grows.

230
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,188
Most people are more comfortable visualizing this with a graph, 

231
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,297
where the higher the value of the graph, the steeper its slope, 

232
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,580
resulting in this ever-steepening upward curve.

233
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,830
Just keep in mind that when we get to higher dimensional variance, 

234
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,080
graphs are a lot less helpful.

235
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,500
This is a highly important equation in its own right.

236
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,138
It's a very powerful concept when the rate of change 

237
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,300
of a value is proportional to the value itself.

238
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,050
This is the equation governing things like compound interest, 

239
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,827
or the early stages of population growth before the effects of limited resources kick in, 

240
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:29,020
or the early stages of an epidemic while most of the population is susceptible.

241
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,360
Calculus students all learn about how the derivative of e to the rt is r times itself.

242
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,418
In other words, this self-reinforcing growth phenomenon is the same 

243
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:46,280
thing as exponential growth, and e to the rt solves this equation.

244
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,490
Actually, a better way to think about it is that there are many different 

245
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,482
solutions to this equation, one for each initial condition, 

246
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:58,873
something like an initial investment size or an initial population, 

247
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:00,120
which we'll just call x0.

248
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,889
Notice, by the way, how the higher the value for x0, 

249
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:06,985
the higher the initial slope of the resulting solution, 

250
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:09,860
which should make complete sense given the equation.

251
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,930
The function e to the rt is just a solution when the initial condition is 1, 

252
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,110
but if you multiply by any other initial condition, 

253
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,720
you get a new function which still satisfies this property.

254
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,476
It still has a derivative which is r times itself, 

255
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:29,960
but this time it starts at x0 since e to the 0 is 1.

256
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,300
This is worth highlighting before we generalize to more dimensions.

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,320
Do not think of the exponential part as being a solution in and of itself.

258
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,380
Think of it as something that acts on an initial condition in order to give a solution.

259
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,189
You see, up in the two-dimensional case, when we have a changing vector whose rate of 

260
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:54,171
change is constrained to be some matrix times itself, 

261
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:58,755
what the solution looks like is also an exponential term acting on a given initial 

262
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:03,670
condition, but the exponential part in that case will produce a matrix that changes with 

263
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,099
time, and the initial condition is a vector.

264
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,525
In fact, you should think of the definition of matrix exponentiation 

265
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:13,940
as being heavily motivated by making sure that this fact is true.

266
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,061
For example, if we look back at the system that popped up with Romeo and Juliet, 

267
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:24,757
the claim now is that solutions look like e raised to this 0, negative 1, 

268
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:28,820
1, 0 matrix all times time multiplied by some initial condition.

269
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,687
But we've already seen the solution in this case, 

270
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:34,580
we know it looks like a rotation matrix times the initial condition.

271
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,066
So let's take a moment to roll up our sleeves and compute the exponential term 

272
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:42,680
using the definition that I mentioned at the start, and see if it lines up.

273
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,643
Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is a shorthand, 

274
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:50,249
a shorthand for plugging it in to this long infinite polynomial, 

275
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,080
the Taylor series for e to the x.

276
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,580
I know it might seem pretty complicated to do this, but trust me, 

277
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,480
it's very satisfying how this particular one turns out.

278
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,949
If you actually sit down and you compute successive powers of this matrix, 

279
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:08,020
what you'd notice is that they fall into a cycling pattern every four iterations.

280
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,940
This should make sense given that we know it's a 90 degree rotation matrix.

281
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,517
So when you add together all infinitely many matrices term by term, 

282
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:39,872
each term in the result looks like a polynomial in t with some nice cycling 

283
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:44,400
pattern in its coefficients, all of them scaled by the relevant factorial term.

284
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,567
Those of you who are savvy with Taylor series might be able to recognize 

285
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:53,845
that each one of these components is the Taylor series for either sine or cosine, 

286
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:57,340
though in that top right corner's case it's actually negative sine.

287
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,380
So what we get from the computation is exactly the rotation matrix we had from before.

288
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,220
To me, this is extremely beautiful.

289
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,220
We have two completely different ways of reasoning about the same system, 

290
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,800
and they give us the same answer.

291
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,099
It's reassuring that they do, but it's wild just how different the mode of 

292
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,718
thought is when you're chugging through this polynomial versus when you're 

293
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:26,820
geometrically reasoning about what a velocity perpendicular to a position must imply.

294
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,971
Hopefully the fact that these line up inspires a little confidence 

295
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:34,320
in the claim that matrix exponents really do solve systems like this.

296
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,306
This explains the computation we saw at the start, by the way, 

297
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:41,273
with the matrix that had negative pi and pi off the diagonals, 

298
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:42,780
producing the negative identity.

299
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,987
This expression is exponentiating a 90 degree rotation matrix times pi, 

300
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:53,460
which is another way to describe what the Romeo-Juliet setup does after pi units of time.

301
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,942
As we now know, that has the effect of rotating everything 180 degrees 

302
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:01,680
in this state space, which is the same as multiplying by negative 1.

303
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,360
Also, for any of you familiar with imaginary number exponents, 

304
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,980
this particular example is ringing a ton of bells.

305
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
It is 100% analogous.

306
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,341
In fact, we could have framed the entire example where Romeo and Juliet's feelings were 

307
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,638
packaged into a complex number, and the rate of change of that complex number would 

308
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:25,140
have been i times itself, since multiplication by i also acts like a 90 degree rotation.

309
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,368
The same exact line of reasoning, both analytic and geometric, 

310
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:33,680
would have led to this whole idea that e to the power i t describes rotation.

311
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,840
These are actually two of many different examples throughout math and physics when you 

312
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,220
find yourself exponentiating some object which acts as a 90 degree rotation times time.

313
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,020
It shows up with quaternions or many of the matrices that pop up in quantum mechanics.

314
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,318
In all of these cases, we have this really neat general idea that if you take some 

315
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,033
operation that rotates 90 degrees in some plane, 

316
00:20:56,033 --> 00:21:00,188
often it's a plane in some high dimensional space that we can't visualize, 

317
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:04,565
then what we get by exponentiating that operation times time is something that 

318
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,280
generates all other rotations in that same plane.

319
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,240
One of the more complicated variations on this same theme is Schrodinger's equation.

320
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,232
It's not just that this has the derivative of 

321
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,780
a state equals some matrix times that state form.

322
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,450
The nature of the relevant matrix here is such that the equation 

323
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,933
also describes a kind of rotation, though in many applications of 

324
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:29,680
Schrodinger's equation it'll be a rotation in a kind of function space.

325
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,722
It's a little more involved though because typically 

326
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,800
there's a combination of many different rotations.

327
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,890
It takes time to really dig into this equation and I would love to do that in a later 

328
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,179
chapter, but right now I cannot help but at least allude to the fact that this 

329
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,795
imaginary unit i that sits so impishly in such a fundamental equation for all of the 

330
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:53,520
universe is playing basically the same role as the matrix from our Romeo-Julia example.

331
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,849
What this i communicates is that the rate of change of a certain state is, 

332
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:03,288
in a sense, perpendicular to that state, and hence that the way things 

333
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,040
have to evolve over time will involve a kind of oscillation.

334
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,480
But matrix exponentiation can do so much more than just rotation.

335
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,040
You can always visualize these sorts of differential equations using a vector field.

336
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,060
The idea is that this equation tells us the velocity of a state is entirely determined 

337
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,659
by its position, so what we do is go to every point in the space and draw a little 

338
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:34,480
vector indicating what the velocity of a state must be if it passes through that point.

339
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,482
For our type of equation, this means that we go to each 

340
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,400
point v in space and we attach the vector m times v.

341
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,784
To intuitively understand how any given initial condition will evolve, 

342
00:22:57,784 --> 00:23:01,231
you let it flow along this field with a velocity always matching 

343
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,360
whatever vector it's sitting on at any given point in time.

344
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,993
So if the claim is that solutions to this equation look like e to the m t times some 

345
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:16,006
initial condition, it means you can visualize what the matrix e to the m t does by 

346
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:21,020
letting every possible initial condition flow along this field for t units of time.

347
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,846
The transition from start to finish is described by whatever 

348
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:32,180
matrix pops out from the computation for e to the m t.

349
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,689
In our main example with the 90 degree rotation matrix, 

350
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:40,121
the vector field looks like this, and as we saw e to the m t 

351
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:44,340
describes rotation in that case, which lines up with flow along this field.

352
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,859
As another example, the more Shakespearean Romeo and Juliet might have equations 

353
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,969
that look a little more like this, where Juliet's rule is symmetric with Romeo's, 

354
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:58,380
and both of them are inclined to get carried away in response to one another's feelings.

355
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,057
Again, the way the vector field you're looking at has been defined 

356
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:06,700
is to go to each point v in space and attach the vector m times v.

357
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,105
This is the pictorial way of saying that the rate of 

358
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:12,940
change of a state must always equal m times itself.

359
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,600
But for this example, flow along the field looks a lot different from how it did before.

360
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,114
If Romeo and Juliet start off anywhere in this upper right half of the plane, 

361
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:27,080
their feelings will feed off of each other and they both tend towards infinity.

362
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,705
If they're in the other half of the plane, well let's just say 

363
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,880
that they stay more true to their in Montague family traditions.

364
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,854
So even before you try calculating the exponential of this particular matrix, 

365
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:45,640
you can already have an intuitive sense for what the answer should look like.

366
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,473
The resulting matrix should describe the transition from time 0 to time t, 

367
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:54,786
which if you look at the field seems to indicate that it will squish along 

368
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:59,560
one diagonal while stretching along another, getting more extreme as t gets larger.

369
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,669
Of course, all of this is presuming that e to the m t 

370
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,720
times an initial condition actually solves these systems.

371
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,320
This is one of those facts that's easiest to believe when you just work it out yourself.

372
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
But I'll run through a quick rough sketch.

373
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,224
Write out the full polynomial that defines e to the m t 

374
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:22,600
and multiply by some initial condition vector on the right.

375
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,420
And then take the derivative of this with respect to t.

376
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,412
Because the matrix m is constant, this just means 

377
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:34,600
applying the power rule to each one of the terms.

378
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,000
And that power rule really nicely cancels out with the factorial terms.

379
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,089
So what we're left with is an expression that looks almost 

380
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:00,817
identical to what we had before, except that each term has an extra m hanging on to it, 

381
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:03,020
but this can be factored out to the left.

382
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,215
So the derivative of the expression is m times the original expression, 

383
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:10,340
and hence it solves the equation.

384
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,524
This actually sweeps under the rug some details required for rigor, 

385
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:18,404
mostly centered around the question of whether or not this thing actually converges, 

386
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:19,820
but it does give the main idea.

387
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,484
In the next chapter I would like to talk more about the properties that 

388
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:28,573
this operation has, most notably its relationship with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, 

389
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:32,037
which leads us to more concrete ways of thinking about how you actually 

390
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,780
carry out this computation, which otherwise seems insane.

391
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,783
Also, time permitting, it might be fun to talk about what 

392
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:41,600
it means to raise e to the power of the derivative operator.

393
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:06,920
Thank you.
