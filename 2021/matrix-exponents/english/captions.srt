1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Let me pull out an old differential equations textbook that I learned from in college,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,520
and let's turn to this funny little exercise in here that asks the reader to compute E to the power

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,600
a t, where a we're told is going to be a matrix, and the insinuation seems to be that the results

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,200
will also be a matrix. It then offers several examples for what you might plug in for a.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,560
Now, taking out a context, putting a matrix into an exponent like this probably seems like total

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,760
nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,480
in this book is that it's useful. It's used to solve a very important class of differential

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,440
equations. In turn, given that the universe is often written in the language of differential

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,400
equations, you see this pop up in physics all the time too, especially in quantum mechanics,

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,120
where matrix exponents are littered throughout the place. They play a particularly prominent role.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,720
This has a lot to do with Schrodinger's equation, which we'll touch on a bit later,

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,440
and it may also help in understanding your romantic relationships, but again, all in due time.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,520
A big part of the reason I want to cover this topic is that there is an extremely nice way

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,480
to visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing using flow that not a lot of people seem

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,800
to talk about, but for the bulk of this chapter, let's start by laying out what exactly the

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,520
operation is, and see if we can get a feel for what kinds of problems it helps us to solve.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,320
The first thing you should know is that this is not some bizarre way to multiply the constant

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,080
e by itself multiple times. You would be right to call that nonsense. The actual definition is

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,880
related to a certain infinite polynomial for describing real number powers of e, what we call

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,240
its Taylor series. For example, if I took the number 2 and plugged it into this polynomial,

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,480
then as you add more and more terms, each of which looks like some power of 2 divided by some factorial,

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,120
the sum approaches a number near 7.389, and this number is precisely e times e.

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,040
If you increment this input by one, then somewhat miraculously, no matter where you started from,

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,040
the effect on the output is always to multiply it by another factor of e.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
For reasons that you're going to see in a bit, mathematicians became interested in plugging

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
all kinds of things into this polynomial, things like complex numbers and, for our purposes today,

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,680
matrices, even when those objects do not immediately make sense as exponents.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
What some authors do is give this infinite polynomial the name exp when you plug in more

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,640
exotic inputs. It's a gentle nod to the connection that this has to exponential functions in the case

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,600
of real numbers, even though obviously these inputs don't make sense as exponents. However,

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,080
an equally common convention is to give a much less gentle nod to the connection and just

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,800
abbreviate the whole thing as e to the power of whatever object you're plugging in, whether that's

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,240
a complex number or a matrix, or all sorts of more exotic objects. So while this equation is

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,320
a theorem for real numbers, it's a definition for more exotic inputs. Cynically, you could call this

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,360
a blatant abuse of notation. More charitably, you might view it as an example of the beautiful

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,640
cycle between discovery and invention in math. In either case, plugging in a matrix even to

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,440
a polynomial might seem a little strange, so let's be clear on what we mean here. The matrix

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,560
has to have the same number of rows and columns. That way you can multiply it by itself according

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,560
to the usual rules of matrix multiplication. This is what we mean by squaring it. Similarly,

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,640
if you were to take that result and then multiply it by the original matrix again,

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,720
this is what we mean by cubing the matrix. If you carry on like this, you can take any whole number

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,600
power of a matrix, it's perfectly sensible. In this context, powers still mean exactly what you

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:57,280
would expect, repeated multiplication. Each term in this polynomial is scaled by 1 divided by some

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,240
factorial, and with matrices, all that means is that you multiply each component by that number.

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
Likewise, it always makes sense to add together two matrices, this is something that you again

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,280
do term by term. The astute among you might ask how sensible it is to take this out to infinity,

47
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,200
which would be a great question, one that I'm largely going to postpone the answer to,

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,040
but I can show you one pretty fun example here now. Take this 2x2 matrix that has negative pi

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,120
and pi sitting off its diagonal entries. Let's see what the sum gives. The first term is the identity

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,440
matrix, this is actually what we mean by definition when we raise a matrix to the zeroth power.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,760
Then we add the matrix itself, which gives us the pi off the diagonal terms, and then add half of

52
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,960
the matrix squared, and continuing on I'll have the computer keep adding more and more terms,

53
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,280
each of which requires taking one more matrix product to get the new power, and then adding

54
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,120
it to a running tally. And as it keeps going, it seems to be approaching a stable value,

55
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,480
which is around negative 1 times the identity matrix. In this sense, we say the infinite sum

56
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,080
equals that negative identity. By the end of this video, my hope is that this particular fact comes

57
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,720
to make total sense to you. For any of you familiar with Euler's famous identity, this is

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,000
essentially the matrix version of that. It turns out that in general, no matter what matrix you

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,040
start with, as you add more and more terms, you eventually approach some stable value,

60
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,680
though sometimes it can take quite a while before you get there.

61
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Just seeing the definition like this in isolation raises all kinds of questions,

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,240
most notably, why would mathematicians and physicists be interested in torturing their

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,360
poor matrices this way? What problems are they trying to solve? And if you're anything like me,

64
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
a new operation is only satisfying when you have a clear view of what it's trying to do,

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,720
some sense of how to predict the output based on the input before you actually crunch the numbers.

66
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,360
How on earth could you have predicted that the matrix with pi off the diagonals

67
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
results in a negative identity matrix like this?

68
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Often in math you should view the definition not as a starting point, but as a target.

69
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
Contrary to the structure of textbooks, mathematicians do not start by making

70
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
definitions and then listing a lot of theorems and proving them and then showing some examples.

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,920
The process of discovering math typically goes the other way around. They start by chewing on

72
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,880
specific problems, and then generalizing those problems, then coming up with constructs that

73
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,840
might be helpful in those general cases, and only then do you write down a new definition,

74
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,960
or extend an old one. As to what sorts of specific examples might motivate matrix exponents,

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
two come to mind. One involving relationships, and the other quantum mechanics.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
Let's start with relationships.

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,000
Suppose we have two lovers, let's call them Romeo and Juliet, and let's let x represent

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,880
Juliet's love for Romeo, and y represent his love for her, both of which are going to be values that

79
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,320
change with time. This is an example we actually touched on in chapter 1, based on a Steven

80
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Strogatz article, but it's okay if you didn't see that. The way their relationship works is that the

81
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,080
rate at which Juliet's love for Romeo changes, the derivative of this value, is equal to negative 1

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,160
times Romeo's love for her. In other words, when Romeo is expressing cool disinterest,

83
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
that's when Juliet's feelings increase, whereas if he becomes too infatuated,

84
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,640
her interest will start to fade.

85
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,680
Romeo, on the other hand, is the opposite. The rate of change of his love is equal to the size

86
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,320
of Juliet's love. So while Juliet is mad at him, his affections tend to decrease,

87
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,400
whereas if she loves him, that's when his feelings grow. Of course, neither one of these numbers is

88
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,240
holding still. As Romeo's love increases in response to Juliet, her equation continues to

89
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,720
apply and drives her love down. Both of these equations always apply, from each infinitesimal

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,240
point in time to the next, so every slight change to one value immediately influences the rate of

91
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,240
change of the other. This is a system of differential equations. It's a puzzle, where your

92
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,080
challenge is to find explicit functions for x of t and y of t that make both of these expressions

93
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,480
true. Now, as systems of differential equations go, this one is on the simpler side, enough so

94
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,600
that many calculus students could probably just guess at an answer. But keep in mind, it's not

95
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,720
enough to find some pair of functions that makes this true. If you want to actually predict where

96
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Romeo and Juliet end up after some starting point, you have to make sure that your functions match

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,840
the initial set of conditions at time t equals zero. More to the point, our actual goal today is

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,880
to systematically solve more general versions of this equation, without guessing and checking,

99
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
and it's that question that leads us to matrix exponents. Very often when you have multiple

100
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,880
changing values like this, it's helpful to package them together as coordinates of a single point in

101
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
a higher dimensional space. So for Romeo and Juliet, think of their relationship as a point

102
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:10,240
in a 2D space, the x-coordinate capturing Juliet's feelings, and the y-coordinate capturing Romeo's.

103
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,920
Sometimes it's helpful to picture this state as an arrow from the origin, other times just as a

104
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,280
point. All that really matters is that it encodes two numbers, and moving forward we'll be writing

105
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,440
that as a column vector. And of course, this is all a function of time. You might picture the rate

106
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
of change of this state, the thing that packages together the derivative of x and the derivative

107
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,600
of y, as a kind of velocity vector in this state space, something that tugs at our point in some

108
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
direction and with some magnitude that indicates how quickly it's changing.

109
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,000
Remember, the rule here is that the rate of change of x is negative y, and the rate of change of y is

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,240
x. Set up as vectors like this, we could rewrite the right-hand side of this equation as a product

111
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,600
of this matrix with the original vector xy. The top row encodes Juliet's rule, and the bottom row

112
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,280
encodes Romeo's rule. So what we have here is a differential equation telling us that the rate

113
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:20,000
of change of some vector is equal to a certain matrix times itself. In a moment we'll talk about

114
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
how matrix exponentiation solves this kind of equation, but before that let me show you a

115
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,760
simpler way that we can solve this particular system, one that uses pure geometry, and it helps

116
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,000
set the stage for visualizing matrix exponents a bit later. This matrix from our system is a 90

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,480
degree rotation matrix. For any of you rusty on how to think about matrices as transformations,

118
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,680
there's a video all about it on this channel, a series really. The basic idea is that when you

119
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,680
multiply a matrix by the vector 1 0, it pulls out the first column, and similarly if you multiply it

120
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,480
by 0 1, that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you look at a matrix,

121
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,920
you can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors, known as the basis

122
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,080
vectors. The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding these two basis

123
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,920
results by that vector's coordinates. So looking back at the matrix from our system, notice how

124
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,520
from its columns we can tell it takes the first basis vector to 0 1, and the second to negative 1

125
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:33,040
0, hence why I'm calling it the 90 degree rotation matrix. What it means for our equation is that

126
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,800
it's saying wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this state space, their rate of change has to look like

127
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,360
a 90 degree rotation of this position vector. The only way velocity can permanently be perpendicular

128
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,640
to position like this is when you rotate around the origin in circular motion, never growing or

129
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,320
shrinking because the rate of change has no component in the direction of the position.

130
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,640
More specifically, since the length of this velocity vector equals the length of the position

131
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,880
vector, then for each unit of time, the distance that this covers is equal to one radius's worth

132
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,440
of arc length along that circle. In other words, it rotates at one radian per unit time,

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,640
so in particular it would take 2 pi units of time to make a full revolution.

134
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,840
If you want to describe this kind of rotation with a formula, we can use a more general rotation

135
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,440
matrix, which looks like this. Again, we can read it in terms of the columns. Notice how the first

136
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,880
column tells us that it takes that first basis vector to cos t sin t, and the second column

137
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,800
tells us that it takes the second basis vector to negative sin t cos t, both of which are consistent

138
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,560
with rotating by t radians. So, to solve the system, if you want to predict where Romeo and

139
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,880
Juliet end up after t units of time, you can multiply this matrix by their initial state.

140
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,520
The active viewers among you might also enjoy taking a moment to pause and confirm that the

141
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,400
explicit formulas you get out of this for x of t and y of t really do satisfy the system

142
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:18,800
of differential equations that we started with. The mathematician in you might wonder if it's

143
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,840
possible to solve not just this specific system, but equations like it for any other matrix,

144
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,080
no matter what its coefficients. To ask this question is to set yourself up to rediscover

145
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,440
matrix exponents. The main goal for today is for you to understand how this equation lets you

146
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,880
intuitively picture the operation which we write as e raised to a matrix, and on the flip side,

147
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,440
how being able to compute matrix exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation.

148
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,880
A much less whimsical example is Schrodinger's famous equation, which is the fundamental

149
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,320
equation describing how systems in quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty

150
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
intimidating, and I mean it's quantum mechanics, so of course it will, but it's actually not that

151
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,840
different from the Romeo and Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a

152
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,160
vector that packages together all the information you might care about in a system, like the various

153
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,040
particles' positions and momenta. It's analogous to our simpler 2D vector that encoded all the

154
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,480
information about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that the rate at which this state vector

155
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,400
looks like a certain matrix times itself. There are a number of things that make Schrodinger's

156
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,960
equation notably more complicated, but in the back of your mind you might think of it as a target

157
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,160
point that you and I can build up to, with simpler examples like Romeo and Juliet offering more

158
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,240
friendly stepping stones along the way. Actually, the simplest example which is tied to ordinary

159
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,680
real-number powers of e is the one-dimensional case. This is when you have a single changing value,

160
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,960
and its rate of change equals some constant times itself. So the bigger the value, the faster it

161
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,360
grows. Most people are more comfortable visualizing this with a graph, where the higher the value of

162
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,320
the graph, the steeper its slope, resulting in this ever-steepening upward curve. Just keep in

163
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
mind that when we get to higher dimensional variance, graphs are a lot less helpful.

164
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,440
This is a highly important equation in its own right. It's a very powerful concept when the rate

165
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
of change of a value is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing things like

166
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,440
compound interest, or the early stages of population growth before the effects of limited

167
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,960
resources kick in, or the early stages of an epidemic while most of the population is susceptible.

168
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,280
Calculus students all learn about how the derivative of e to the rt is r times itself.

169
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,880
In other words, this self-reinforcing growth phenomenon is the same thing as exponential

170
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,720
growth, and e to the rt solves this equation. Actually, a better way to think about it is that

171
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,200
there are many different solutions to this equation, one for each initial condition,

172
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,080
something like an initial investment size or an initial population, which we'll just call x0.

173
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,160
Notice, by the way, how the higher the value for x0, the higher the initial slope of the resulting

174
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,440
solution, which should make complete sense given the equation. The function e to the rt is just

175
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,000
a solution when the initial condition is 1, but if you multiply by any other initial condition,

176
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,640
you get a new function which still satisfies this property. It still has a derivative which is r

177
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,840
times itself, but this time it starts at x0 since e to the 0 is 1. This is worth highlighting before

178
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,560
we generalize to more dimensions. Do not think of the exponential part as being a solution in

179
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,320
and of itself. Think of it as something that acts on an initial condition in order to give a solution.

180
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,960
You see, up in the two-dimensional case, when we have a changing vector whose rate of change

181
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,040
is constrained to be some matrix times itself, what the solution looks like is also an exponential

182
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,320
term acting on a given initial condition, but the exponential part, in that case, will produce

183
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,920
a matrix that changes with time, and the initial condition is a vector. In fact, you should think

184
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,120
of the definition of matrix exponentiation as being heavily motivated by making sure that this

185
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,200
fact is true. For example, if we look back at the system that popped up with Romeo and Juliet,

186
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,800
the claim now is that solutions look like e raised to this 0, negative 1, 1, 0 matrix all times time,

187
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,520
multiplied by some initial condition. But we've already seen the solution in this case,

188
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,240
we know it looks like a rotation matrix times the initial condition. So let's take a moment to roll

189
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,200
up our sleeves and compute the exponential term using the definition that I mentioned at the start

190
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,800
and see if it lines up. Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is a shorthand,

191
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,600
a shorthand for plugging it in to this long infinite polynomial, the Taylor series for e to

192
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,760
the x. I know it might seem pretty complicated to do this, but trust me, it's very satisfying

193
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,280
how this particular one turns out. If you actually sit down and you compute successive powers of this

194
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:17,040
matrix, what you'd notice is that they fall into a cycling pattern every four iterations.

195
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:31,360
This should make sense given that we know it's a 90 degree rotation matrix.

196
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,800
So when you add together all infinitely many matrices term by term, each term in the result

197
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,920
looks like a polynomial in t with some nice cycling pattern in its coefficients,

198
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,000
all of them scaled by the relevant factorial term. Those of you who are savvy with Taylor series might

199
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,560
be able to recognize that each one of these components is the Taylor series for either

200
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,800
sine or cosine, though in that top right corner's case it's actually negative sine.

201
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,280
So what we get from the computation is exactly the rotation matrix we had from before.

202
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,400
To me, this is extremely beautiful. We have two completely different ways of reasoning about the

203
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
same system, and they give us the same answer. I mean, it's reassuring that they do, but it is

204
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
wild just how different the mode of thought is when you're chugging through this polynomial

205
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,240
versus when you're geometrically reasoning about what a velocity perpendicular to a position must

206
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,200
imply. Hopefully the fact that these line up inspires a little confidence in the claim that

207
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,880
matrix exponents really do solve systems like this. This explains the computation we saw at

208
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,360
the start, by the way, with the matrix that had negative pi and pi off the diagonals,

209
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,200
producing the negative identity. This expression is exponentiating a 90 degree rotation matrix

210
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,000
times pi, which is another way to describe what the Romeo-Juliet setup does after pi units of time.

211
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,440
As we now know, that has the effect of rotating everything 180 degrees in this state space,

212
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,200
which is the same as multiplying by negative 1. Also, for any of you familiar with imaginary

213
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,720
number exponents, this particular example is probably ringing a ton of bells. It is 100%

214
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,600
analogous. In fact, we could have framed the entire example where Romeo and Juliet's feelings

215
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,480
packaged into a complex number, and the rate of change of that complex number would have been i

216
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,880
times itself, since multiplication by i also acts like a 90 degree rotation. The same exact line of

217
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,560
reasoning, both analytic and geometric, would have led to this whole idea that e to the power i t

218
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,920
describes rotation. These are actually two of many different examples throughout math and physics

219
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,480
when you find yourself exponentiating some object which acts as a 90 degree rotation

220
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,000
times time. It shows up with quaternions or many of the matrices that pop up in quantum mechanics.

221
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
In all of these cases, we have this really neat general idea that if you take some operation that

222
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,240
rotates 90 degrees in some plane, often it's a plane in some high dimensional space that we

223
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,000
can't visualize, then what we get by exponentiating that operation times time is something that

224
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,440
generates all other rotations in that same plane. One of the more complicated variations on this

225
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,720
same theme is Schrodinger's equation. It's not just that this has the derivative of a state equals

226
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,880
some matrix times that state form. The nature of the relevant matrix here is such that the equation

227
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,680
also describes a kind of rotation, though in many applications of Schrodinger's equation it'll be a

228
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,800
rotation in a kind of function space. It's a little more involved though because typically there's a

229
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,840
combination of many different rotations. It takes time to really dig into this equation, and I would

230
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,200
love to do that in a later chapter, but right now I cannot help but at least allude to the fact

231
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,160
that this imaginary unit i that sits so impishly in such a fundamental equation for all of the

232
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,520
universe is playing basically the same role as the matrix from our Romeo-Julia example.

233
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,680
What this i communicates is that the rate of change of a certain state is, in a sense,

234
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,520
perpendicular to that state, and hence that the way things have to evolve over time will involve

235
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:15,360
a kind of oscillation. But matrix exponentiation can do so much more than just rotation. You can

236
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,280
always visualize these sorts of differential equations using a vector field. The idea is that

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,880
this equation tells us the velocity of a state is entirely determined by its position, so what we do

238
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,600
is go to every point in the space and draw a little vector indicating what the velocity of a

239
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,600
state must be if it passes through that point. For our type of equation, this means that we go

240
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,600
to each point v in space and we attach the vector m times v.

241
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,200
To intuitively understand how any given initial condition will evolve, you let it flow along this

242
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,160
field with a velocity always matching whatever vector it's sitting on at any given point in time.

243
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,080
So if the claim is that solutions to this equation look like e to the mt times some initial condition,

244
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,600
it means you can visualize what the matrix e to the mt does

245
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,800
by letting every possible initial condition flow along this field for t units of time.

246
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:32,000
The transition from start to finish is described by whatever matrix pops out from the computation for e to the mt.

247
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,480
In our main example with the 90 degree rotation matrix, the vector field looks like this,

248
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,240
and as we saw e to the mt describes rotation in that case, which lines up with flow along this field.

249
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,720
As another example, the more Shakespearean Romeo and Juliet might have equations that look a little

250
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,000
more like this, where Juliet's rule is symmetric with Romeo's, and both of them are inclined to get

251
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,200
carried away in response to one another's feelings. Again, the way the vector field you're looking at

252
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,120
has been defined is to go to each point v in space and attach the vector m times v.

253
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,800
This is the pictorial way of saying that the rate of change of a state must always equal m times itself.

254
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,560
But for this example, flow along the field looks a lot different from how it did before.

255
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,440
If Romeo and Juliet start off anywhere in this upper right half of the plane,

256
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
their feelings will feed off of each other and they both tend towards infinity.

257
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,880
If they're in the other half of the plane, well let's just say that they stay more true to their

258
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,480
Capulet and Montagu family traditions. So even before you try calculating the exponential of

259
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,280
this particular matrix, you can already have an intuitive sense for what the answer should look like.

260
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,200
The resulting matrix should describe the transition from time 0 to time t, which if you

261
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,400
look at the field seems to indicate that it will squish along one diagonal while stretching along

262
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,960
another, getting more extreme as t gets larger. Of course, all of this is presuming that e to the

263
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,800
m t times an initial condition actually solves these systems. This is one of those facts that's

264
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,080
easiest to believe when you just work it out yourself. But I'll run through a quick rough sketch.

265
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Write out the full polynomial that defines e to the m t

266
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,080
and multiply by some initial condition vector on the right.

267
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,920
And then take the derivative of this with respect to t. Because the matrix m is a constant,

268
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,640
this just means applying the power rule to each one of the terms.

269
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:47,040
And that power rule really nicely cancels out with the factorial terms.

270
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,000
So what we're left with is an expression that looks almost identical to what we had before,

271
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,880
except that each term has an extra m hanging onto it. But this can be factored out to the left.

272
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,680
So the derivative of the expression is m times the original expression, and hence it solves

273
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,360
the equation. This actually sweeps under the rug some details required for rigor, mostly centered

274
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,760
around the question of whether or not this thing actually converges, but it does give the main idea.

275
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,120
In the next chapter I would like to talk more about the properties that this operation has,

276
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,080
most notably its relationship with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which leads us to more concrete

277
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,720
ways of thinking about how you actually carry out this computation, which otherwise seems insane.

278
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,160
Also, time permitting, it might be fun to talk about what it means to raise e to the power of

279
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,000
the derivative operator.
