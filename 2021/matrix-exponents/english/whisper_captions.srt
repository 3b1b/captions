1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Let me pull out an old differential equations textbook that I learned from in college,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,500
and let's turn to this funny little exercise in here that asks the reader to compute E to the power

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,680
a t, where a we're told is going to be a matrix, and the insinuation seems to be that the results

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,280
will also be a matrix. It then offers several examples for what you might plug in for a.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,600
Now, taking out a context, putting a matrix into an exponent like this probably seems like total

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,880
nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,520
in this book is that it's useful. It's used to solve a very important class of differential

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,480
equations. In turn, given that the universe is often written in the language of differential

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,420
equations, you see this pop up in physics all the time too, especially in quantum mechanics,

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,800
where matrix exponents are littered throughout the place. They play a particularly prominent role.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
This has a lot to do with Schrodinger's equation, which we'll touch on a bit later,

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,480
and it may also help in understanding your romantic relationships, but again, all in due time.

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,580
A big part of the reason I want to cover this topic is that there is an extremely nice way

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,520
to visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing using flow that not a lot of people seem

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,940
to talk about, but for the bulk of this chapter, let's start by laying out what exactly the

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,600
operation is, and see if we can get a feel for what kinds of problems it helps us to solve.

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,280
The first thing you should know is that this is not some bizarre way to multiply the constant

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,220
e by itself multiple times. You would be right to call that nonsense. The actual definition is

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,060
related to a certain infinite polynomial for describing real number powers of e,

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,120
what we call its Taylor series. For example, if I took the number 2 and plugged it into

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,940
this polynomial, then as you add more and more terms, each of which looks like some power of 2

22
00:01:48,940 --> 00:02:00,280
divided by some factorial. The sum approaches a number near 7.389, and this number is precisely

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,280
e times e. If you increment this input by one, then somewhat miraculously, no matter where you

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,780
started from, the effect on the output is always to multiply it by another factor of e. For reasons

25
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,940
that you're going to see in a bit, mathematicians became interested in plugging all kinds of things

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,640
into this polynomial, things like complex numbers, and for our purposes today, matrices,

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,980
even when those objects do not immediately make sense as exponents. What some authors do is give

28
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,880
this infinite polynomial the name exp when you plug in more exotic inputs. It's a gentle nod to

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,400
the connection that this has to exponential functions in the case of real numbers,

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,660
even though obviously these inputs don't make sense as exponents. However, an equally common

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,080
convention is to give a much less gentle nod to the connection and just abbreviate the whole

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,120
thing as e to the power of whatever object you're plugging in, whether that's a complex number or a

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,740
matrix or all sorts of more exotic objects. So while this equation is a theorem for real numbers,

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,880
it's a definition for more exotic inputs. Cynically, you could call this a blatant

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,720
abuse of notation. More charitably, you might view it as an example of the beautiful cycle

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,640
between discovery and invention in math. In either case, plugging in a matrix even

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,440
to a polynomial might seem a little strange, so let's be clear on what we mean here. The matrix

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,580
has to have the same number of rows and columns. That way you can multiply it by itself according

39
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,480
to the usual rules of matrix multiplication. This is what we mean by squaring it. Similarly,

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
if you were to take that result and then multiply it by the original matrix again,

41
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,040
this is what we mean by cubing the matrix. If you carry on like this, you can take any

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,980
whole number power of a matrix, it's perfectly sensible. In this context, powers still mean

43
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,520
exactly what you would expect, repeated multiplication.

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,040
Each term in this polynomial is scaled by one divided by some factorial, and with matrices,

45
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,440
all that means is that you multiply each component by that number.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,660
Likewise, it always makes sense to add together two matrices, this is something you again do

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,040
term by term. The astute among you might ask how sensible it is to take this out to infinity,

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,060
which would be a great question, one that I'm largely going to postpone the answer to,

49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,020
but I can show you one pretty fun example here now. Take this 2x2 matrix that has negative pi

50
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,820
and pi sitting off its diagonal entries. Let's see what the sum gives. The first term is the

51
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,520
identity matrix, this is what we mean by definition when we raise a matrix to the 0th power.

52
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,280
Then we add the matrix itself, which gives us the pi off the diagonal terms,

53
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,060
and then add half of the matrix squared, and continuing on I'll have the computer keep adding

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,480
more and more terms, each of which requires taking one more matrix product to get the new power,

55
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,080
and then adding it to a running tally. And as it keeps going, it seems to be approaching a

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,380
stable value, which is around negative one times the identity matrix. In this sense,

57
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,420
we say the infinite sum equals that negative identity. By the end of this video, my hope is

58
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,120
that this particular fact comes to make total sense to you. For any of you familiar with

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,320
Euler's famous identity, this is essentially the matrix version of that. It turns out that in

60
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,140
general, no matter what matrix you start with, as you add more and more terms, you eventually

61
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,120
approach some stable value, though sometimes it can take quite a while before you get there.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,440
Just seeing the definition like this in isolation raises all kinds of questions, most notably,

63
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,980
why would mathematicians and physicists be interested in torturing their poor matrices

64
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,320
this way? What problems are they trying to solve? And if you're anything like me,

65
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,140
a new operation is only satisfying when you have a clear view of what it's trying to do,

66
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,800
some sense of how to predict the output based on the input before you actually crunch the numbers.

67
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,180
How on earth could you have predicted that the matrix with pi off the diagonals

68
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,900
results in a negative identity matrix like this?

69
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,380
Often in math you should view the definition not as a starting point, but as a target.

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,040
Contrary to the structure of textbooks, mathematicians do not start by making definitions

71
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,720
and then listing a lot of theorems and proving them and then showing some examples.

72
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,220
The process of discovering math typically goes the other way around.

73
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,880
They start by chewing on specific problems, and then generalizing those problems,

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,520
then coming up with constructs that might be helpful in those general cases,

75
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,240
and only then do you write down a new definition, or extend an old one.

76
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,600
As to what sorts of specific examples might motivate matrix exponents,

77
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,500
two come to mind. One involving relationships, and the other quantum mechanics.

78
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,240
Let's start with relationships.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,420
Let's call two lovers, Romeo and Juliet, and let x represent Juliet's love for Romeo,

80
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,940
and y represent his love for her, both of which are values that change with time.

81
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,280
This is an example we actually touched on in chapter 1, based on a Steven Strogatz article,

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,160
but it's okay if you didn't see that. The way their relationship works is that the rate at

83
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,540
Juliet's love for Romeo changes, the derivative of this value, is equal to negative one times

84
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,760
Romeo's love for her. So in other words, when Romeo is expressing cool disinterest, that's when

85
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,400
Juliet's feelings actually increase, whereas if he becomes too infatuated, her interest will start to

86
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,720
fade. Romeo, on the other hand, is the opposite. The rate of change of his love is equal to the

87
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,480
of Juliet's love, so while Juliet is mad at him, his affections tend to decrease,

88
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,540
whereas if she loves him, that's when his feelings grow. Of course, neither one of these numbers is

89
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,360
holding still. As Romeo's love increases in response to Juliet, her equation continues to

90
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,780
apply and drives her love down. Both of these equations always apply, from each infinitesimal

91
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,280
point in time to the next, so every slight change to one value immediately influences the rate of

92
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,940
change of the other. This is a system of differential equations. It's a puzzle, where your challenge is

93
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,520
to find explicit functions for x of t and y of t that make both of these expressions true.

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Now, as systems of differential equations go, this one is on the simpler side,

95
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,740
enough so that many calculus students could probably just guess at an answer.

96
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,500
But keep in mind, it's not enough to find some pair of functions that makes this true.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,380
If you want to actually predict where Romeo and Juliet end up after some starting point,

98
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,840
you have to make sure that your functions match the initial set of conditions at time t equals 0.

99
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,620
More to the point, our actual goal today is to systematically solve more general versions of

100
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,900
this equation, without guessing and checking, and it's that question that leads us to matrix

101
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,520
exponents. Very often when you have multiple changing values like this, it's helpful to

102
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,400
package them together as coordinates of a single point in a higher dimensional space. So for Romeo

103
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,300
and Juliet, think of their relationship as a point in a 2D space, the x-coordinate capturing

104
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:14,800
Juliet's feelings, and the y-coordinate capturing Romeo's. Sometimes it's helpful to picture this

105
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,540
as an arrow from the origin, other times just as a point. All that really matters is that it encodes

106
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,240
two numbers, and moving forward we'll be writing that as a column vector. And of course, this is

107
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,780
all a function of time. You might picture the rate of change of this state, the thing that packages

108
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,280
together the derivative of x and the derivative of y, as a kind of velocity vector in this state

109
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,120
space, something that tugs at our point in some direction and with some magnitude that indicates

110
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,820
how quickly it's changing. Remember, the rule here is that the rate of change of x is negative y,

111
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,000
and the rate of change of y is x. Set up as vectors like this, we could rewrite the right

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,740
hand side of this equation as a product of this matrix with the original vector xy. The top row

113
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:12,100
encodes Juliet's rule, and the bottom row encodes Romeo's rule. So what we have here is a

114
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,880
vector is equal to a certain matrix times itself.

115
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,920
In a moment we'll talk about how matrix exponentiation solves this kind of equation,

116
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,180
but before that let me show you a simpler way that we can solve this particular system,

117
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,720
one that uses pure geometry, and it helps set the stage for visualizing matrix exponents a bit later.

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,380
This matrix from our system is a 90 degree rotation matrix.

119
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,180
For any of you rusty on how to think about matrices as transformations, there's a video

120
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,600
all about it on this channel, a series really. The basic idea is that when you multiply a matrix

121
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,640
by the vector 1 0, it pulls out the first column, and similarly if you multiply it by 0 1,

122
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,160
that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you look at a matrix,

123
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,360
you can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors, known as the matrix.

124
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:14,580
The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding these two basis results

125
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,400
by that vector's coordinates. So looking back at the matrix from our system, notice how from its

126
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,980
columns we can tell it takes the first basis vector to 0 1, and the second to negative 1 0,

127
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,200
hence why I'm calling it the 90 degree rotation matrix.

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,980
What it means for our equation is that it's saying wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this

129
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,960
space, their rate of change has to look like a 90 degree rotation of this position vector.

130
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,480
The only way velocity can permanently be perpendicular to position like this

131
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,400
is when you rotate around the origin in circular motion, never growing or shrinking because the

132
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,940
rate of change has no component in the direction of the position. More specifically, since the

133
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,140
length of this velocity vector equals the length of the position vector, then for each unit of time,

134
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,800
the distance that this covers is equal to one radius's worth of arc length along that circle.

135
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,520
In other words, it rotates at one radian per unit time,

136
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,680
so in particular it would take 2 pi units of time to make a full revolution.

137
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,840
If you want to describe this kind of rotation with a formula, we can use a more general rotation

138
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,480
matrix, which looks like this. Again, we can read it in terms of the columns. Notice how the first

139
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,920
column tells us that it takes that first basis vector to cos t sin t, and the second column

140
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,800
tells us that it takes the second basis vector to negative sin t cos t, both of which are consistent

141
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,720
with rotating by t radians. So, to solve the system, if you want to predict where Romeo and

142
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,960
Juliet end up after t units of time, you can multiply this matrix by their initial state.

143
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,540
The active viewers among you might also enjoy taking a moment to pause and confirm that the

144
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,620
explicit formulas you get out of this for x of t and y of t really do satisfy the system of

145
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:19,880
differential equations that we started with. The mathematician in you might wonder if it's

146
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,780
possible to solve not just this specific system, but equations like it for any other matrix,

147
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,560
no matter its coefficients. To ask this question is to set yourself up to rediscover matrix

148
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,280
exponents. The main goal for today is for you to understand how this equation lets you intuitively

149
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,640
picture the operation which we write as e raised to a matrix, and on the flip side, how being able

150
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,800
to compute matrix exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation. A much less whimsical example

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,920
is Schrodinger's famous equation, which is the fundamental equation describing how systems in

152
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,120
quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty intimidating, and I mean it's quantum

153
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,320
mechanics so of course it will, but it's actually not that different from the Romeo-Juliet setup.

154
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,460
This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a vector that packages together all the

155
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,160
information you might care about in a system, like the various particles' positions and momenta.

156
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,900
It's analogous to our simpler 2D vector that encoded all the information about Romeo and Juliet.

157
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,740
The equation says that the rate at which this state vector changes looks like a certain matrix

158
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,580
times itself. There are a number of things that make Schrodinger's equation notably more

159
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,720
complicated, but in the back of your mind you might think of it as a target point that you and

160
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,960
I can build up to, with simpler examples like Romeo and Juliet offering more friendly stepping

161
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,760
stones along the way. Actually the simplest example, which is tied to ordinary real number

162
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,280
powers of e, is the one-dimensional case. This is when you have a single changing value, and its rate

163
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,440
of change equals some constant times itself. So the bigger the value, the faster it grows.

164
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,360
Most people are more comfortable visualizing this with a graph, where the higher the value

165
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,300
of the graph, the steeper its slope, resulting in this ever-steepening upward curve. Just keep

166
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,080
in mind that when we get to higher dimensional variance, graphs are a lot less helpful.

167
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,540
This is a highly important equation in its own right. It's a very powerful concept when the rate

168
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,020
of change of a value is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing

169
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,240
compound interest, or the early stages of population growth before the effects of

170
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,480
limited resources kick in, or the early stages of an epidemic while most of the population is

171
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:37,360
susceptible. Calculus students all learn about how the derivative of e to the rt is r times itself.

172
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,880
In other words, this self-reinforcing growth phenomenon is the same thing as exponential

173
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,820
growth, and e to the rt solves this equation. Actually, a better way to think about it is that

174
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,820
there are many different solutions to this equation, one for each initial condition,

175
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,120
something like an initial investment size or an initial population, which we'll just call x0.

176
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,860
Notice, by the way, how the higher the value for x0, the higher the initial slope of the

177
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,860
resulting solution, which should make complete sense given the equation.

178
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,360
The function e to the rt is just a solution when the initial condition is 1, but if you multiply by

179
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,440
any other initial condition, you get a new function which still satisfies this property. It still has

180
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,960
a derivative which is r times itself, but this time it starts at x0 since e to the 0 is 1.

181
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,020
This is worth highlighting before we generalize to more dimensions. Do not think of the exponential

182
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,600
part as being a solution in and of itself. Think of it as something that acts on an initial condition

183
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:49,580
in order to give a solution. You see, up in the two-dimensional case, when we have a changing

184
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:55,160
vector whose rate of change is constrained to be some matrix times itself, what the solution looks

185
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,300
like is also an exponential term acting on a given initial condition, but the exponential part in that

186
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,720
case will produce a matrix that changes with time, and the initial condition is a vector. In fact, you

187
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,000
should think of the definition of matrix exponentiation as being heavily motivated by making sure that

188
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,700
this fact is true. For example, if we look back at the system that popped up with Romeo and Juliet,

189
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:26,560
the claim now is that solutions look like e raised to this 0, negative 1, 1, 0 matrix all times time

190
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,100
multiplied by some initial condition. But we've already seen the solution in this case, we know it

191
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,620
looks like a rotation matrix times the initial condition. So let's take a moment to roll up our

192
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,020
sleeves and compute the exponential term using the definition that I mentioned at the start,

193
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,520
and see if it lines up. Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is a shorthand,

194
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,080
a shorthand for plugging it in to this long infinite polynomial, the Taylor series for e to the x.

195
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,180
I know it might seem pretty complicated to do this, but trust me, it's very satisfying how this

196
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,820
particular one turns out. If you actually sit down and you compute successive powers of this matrix,

197
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,020
what you'd notice is that they fall into a cycling pattern every four iterations.

198
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,940
This should make sense given that we know it's a 90 degree rotation matrix.

199
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,640
So when you add together all infinitely many matrices term by term, each term in the result

200
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,420
looks like a polynomial in t with some nice cycling pattern in its coefficients,

201
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,080
all of them scaled by the relevant factorial term. Those of you who are savvy with Taylor series might

202
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,000
be able to recognize that each one of these components is the Taylor series for either sine

203
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,720
or cosine, though in that top right corner's case it's actually negative sine. So what we get from

204
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:08,800
the computation is exactly the rotation matrix we had from before. To me, this is extremely

205
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,120
beautiful. We have two completely different ways of reasoning about the same system,

206
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,080
and they give us the same answer. It's reassuring that they do, but it's wild just how different the

207
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,880
mode of thought is when you're chugging through this polynomial versus when you're geometrically

208
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,820
reasoning about what a velocity perpendicular to a position must imply. Hopefully the fact that

209
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,320
these line up inspires a little confidence in the claim that matrix exponents really do solve

210
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,540
systems like this. This explains the computation we saw at the start, by the way, with the matrix

211
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,200
that had negative pi and pi off the diagonals, producing the negative identity. This expression

212
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,300
is exponentiating a 90 degree rotation matrix times pi, which is another way to describe what

213
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,820
the Romeo-Juliet setup does after pi units of time. As we now know, that has the effect of

214
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,680
rotating everything 180 degrees in this state space, which is the same as multiplying by negative 1.

215
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,620
Also, for any of you familiar with imaginary number exponents, this particular example is

216
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,700
ringing a ton of bells. It is 100% analogous. In fact, we could have framed the entire example

217
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,480
where Romeo and Juliet's feelings were packaged into a complex number, and the rate of change

218
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,040
of that complex number would have been i times itself, since multiplication by i also acts like

219
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,020
a 90 degree rotation. The same exact line of reasoning, both analytic and geometric,

220
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,060
would have led to this whole idea that e to the power i t describes rotation. These are actually

221
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,560
two of many different examples throughout math and physics when you find yourself exponentiating

222
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,920
some object which acts as a 90 degree rotation times time. It shows up with quaternions or many

223
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,880
of the matrices that pop up in quantum mechanics. In all of these cases, we have this really neat

224
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,620
general idea that if you take some operation that rotates 90 degrees in some plane, often it's a

225
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,720
plane in some high dimensional space that we can't visualize, then what we get by exponentiating that

226
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,280
operation times time is something that generates all other rotations in that same plane.

227
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,240
One of the more complicated variations on this same theme is Schrodinger's equation.

228
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,220
It's not just that this has the derivative of a state equals some matrix times that state

229
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,260
form. The nature of the relevant matrix here is such that the equation also describes a kind of

230
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,900
rotation, though in many applications of Schrodinger's equation it'll be a rotation in a kind of

231
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,400
function space. It's a little more involved though because typically there's a combination

232
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,060
of many different rotations. It takes time to really dig into this equation and I would love

233
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,040
to do that in a later chapter, but right now I cannot help but at least allude to the fact

234
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,280
that this imaginary unit i that sits so impishly in such a fundamental equation for all of the

235
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,520
universe is playing basically the same role as the matrix from our Romeo-Julia example.

236
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,540
What this i communicates is that the rate of change of a certain state is, in a sense,

237
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,760
perpendicular to that state, and hence that the way things have to evolve over time

238
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:13,960
will involve a kind of oscillation. But matrix exponentiation can do so much more than just

239
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,040
rotation. You can always visualize these sorts of differential equations using a vector field.

240
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,100
The idea is that this equation tells us the velocity of a state is entirely determined by

241
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,240
its position, so what we do is go to every point in the space and draw a little vector indicating

242
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,480
what the velocity of a state must be if it passes through that point. For our type of equation,

243
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,400
this means that we go to each point v in space and we attach the vector m times v.

244
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,240
To intuitively understand how any given initial condition will evolve, you let it flow along this

245
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,360
field with a velocity always matching whatever vector it's sitting on at any given point in time.

246
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,140
So if the claim is that solutions to this equation look like e to the m t times some initial

247
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,000
condition, it means you can visualize what the matrix e to the m t does by letting every possible

248
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:27,120
initial condition flow along this field for t units of time. The transition from start to finish

249
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:34,420
is described by whatever matrix pops out from the computation for e to the m t. In our main example

250
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,360
with the 90 degree rotation matrix, the vector field looks like this, and as we saw e to the m t

251
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,340
describes rotation in that case, which lines up with flow along this field.

252
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,780
As another example, the more Shakespearean Romeo and Juliet might have equations that look a little

253
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,040
more like this, where Juliet's rule is symmetric with Romeo's, and both of them are inclined to get

254
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,280
carried away in response to one another's feelings. Again, the way the vector field you're looking at

255
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,720
has been defined is to go to each point v in space and attach the vector m times v. This is the

256
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,940
pictorial way of saying that the rate of change of a state must always equal m times itself.

257
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,600
But for this example, flow along the field looks a lot different from how it did before.

258
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
If Romeo and Juliet start off anywhere in this upper right half of the plane,

259
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,080
their feelings will feed off of each other and they both tend towards infinity.

260
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,080
If they're in the other half of the plane, well let's just say that they stay more true to their

261
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,780
in Montague family traditions. So even before you try calculating the exponential of this

262
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,000
particular matrix, you can already have an intuitive sense for what the answer should

263
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,240
look like. The resulting matrix should describe the transition from time 0 to time t, which if

264
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,080
you look at the field seems to indicate that it will squish along one diagonal while stretching

265
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,540
along another, getting more extreme as t gets larger. Of course, all of this is presuming that

266
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,540
e to the m t times an initial condition actually solves these systems. This is one of those facts

267
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,780
that's easiest to believe when you just work it out yourself. But I'll run through a quick rough

268
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:21,200
sketch. Write out the full polynomial that defines e to the m t and multiply by some initial condition

269
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:31,240
vector on the right. And then take the derivative of this with respect to t. Because the matrix m is

270
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,600
constant, this just means applying the power rule to each one of the terms.

271
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,000
And that power rule really nicely cancels out with the factorial terms.

272
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,700
So what we're left with is an expression that looks almost identical to what we had before,

273
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,020
except that each term has an extra m hanging on to it, but this can be factored out to the left.

274
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,920
So the derivative of the expression is m times the original expression, and hence it solves the

275
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,640
equation. This actually sweeps under the rug some details required for rigor, mostly centered around

276
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,260
the question of whether or not this thing actually converges, but it does give the main idea. In the

277
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,820
next chapter I would like to talk more about the properties that this operation has, most notably

278
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,740
its relationship with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which leads us to more concrete ways of thinking

279
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,980
about how you actually carry out this computation, which otherwise seems insane. Also, time permitting,

280
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,600
it might be fun to talk about what it means to raise e to the power of the derivative operator.

281
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:06,920
Thank you.
