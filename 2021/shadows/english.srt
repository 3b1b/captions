1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
In a moment I'm going to tell you about a certain really nice puzzle involving the shadow of a cube.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,800
But before we get to that, I should say that the point of this video is not exactly the puzzle per se,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,700
it's about two distinct problem-solving styles that are reflected in two different ways that we can tackle this problem.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:23,400
In fact, let's anthropomorphize those two different styles by imagining two students, Alice and Bob, that embody each one of the approaches.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,300
So Bob will be the kind of student who really loves calculation.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,000
As soon as there's a moment when he can dig into the details and get a very concrete view of the concrete situation in front of him, that's where he's the most pleased.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,300
Alice, on the other hand, is more inclined to procrastinate the computations,

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,600
not because she doesn't know how to do them or doesn't want to per se,

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,700
but she prefers to get a nice high-level general overview of the kind of problem she's dealing with,

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,100
the general shape that it has, before she digs into the computations themselves.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,400
She's most pleased if she understands not just the specific question sitting in front of her,

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,000
but also the broadest possible way that you could generalize it,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,800
and especially if the more general view can lend itself to more swift and elegant computations, once she does actually sit down to carry them out.

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,800
Now the puzzle that both of them are going to be faced with is to find the average area for the shadow of a cube.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,900
So if I have a cube kind of sitting here hovering in space, there are a few things that influence the area of its shadow.

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,800
One obvious one would be the size of the cube, smaller cube, smaller shadow.

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,700
But also if it's sitting at different orientations, those orientations correspond to different particular shadows with different areas.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:44,300
And when I say find the average here, what I mean is average over all possible orientations for a particular size of the cube.

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,400
The astute among you might point out that it also matters a lot where the light source is.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,100
If the light source were very low, close to the cube itself, then the shadow ends up larger.

21
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,000
And if the light source were kind of positioned laterally off to the side, this can distort the shadow and give it a very different shape.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Accounting for that light position stands to be highly interesting in its own right, but the puzzle is hard enough as it is,

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,700
so at least initially, let's do the easiest thing we can and say that the light is directly above the cube and really far away,

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,200
effectively infinitely far, so that all we're considering is a flat projection,

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,700
in the sense that if you look at any coordinates, x, y, z, in space, the flat projection would be x, y, 0.

26
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,800
So just to get our bearings, the easiest situation to think about would be if the cube is straight up, with two of its faces parallel to the ground.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:38,700
In that case, this flat projection shadow is simply a square, and if we say the side lengths of the cube are s, then the area of that shadow is s squared.

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,200
And by the way, any time that I have a label up on these animations, like the one down here, I'll be assuming that the relevant cube has a side length of 1.

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,500
Now another special case among all the orientations that's fun to think about is if the long diagonal is parallel to the direction of the light.

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,000
In that case, the shadow actually looks like a regular hexagon, and if you use some of the methods that we will develop in a few minutes,

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,600
you can compute that the area of that shadow is exactly the square root of 3 times the area of one of the square faces.

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,600
But of course, more often, the actual shadow will be not so regular as a square or a hexagon.

33
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,200
It's some harder to think about shape based on some harder to think about orientation for this cube.

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,100
Earlier, I casually threw out this phrase of averaging over all possible orientations, but you could rightly ask, what exactly is that supposed to mean?

35
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,000
I think a lot of us have an intuitive feel for what we want it to mean, at least in the sense of what experiment would you do to verify it.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,500
You might imagine tossing this cube in the air like a dye, freezing it at some arbitrary point, recording the area of the shadow from that position,

37
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,100
and then repeating.

38
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,100
If you do this many many times over and over, you can take the mean of your sample.

39
00:03:49,100 --> 00:04:00,600
The number that we want to get at, the true average here, should be whatever that experimental mean approaches as you do more and more tosses, approaching infinitely many.

40
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:08,300
Even still, the sticklers among you could complain that doesn't really answer the question, because it leaves open the issue of how we're defining a random toss.

41
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,300
The proper way to answer this, if we want it to be more formal, would be to first describe the space of all possible orientations,

42
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:23,100
which mathematicians have actually given a fancy name. They call it SO3, typically defined in terms of a certain family of 3x3 matrices.

43
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,100
And the question we want to answer is, what probability distribution are we putting to this entire space?

44
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,800
It's only when such a probability distribution is well-defined that we can answer a question involving an average.

45
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,200
If you are a stickler for that kind of thing, I want you to hold off on that question until the end of the video.

46
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:49,200
You'll be surprised at how far we can get with the more heuristic, experimental idea of just repeating a bunch of random tosses without really defining the distribution.

47
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:57,900
Once we see Alice and Bob's solutions, it's actually very interesting to ask how exactly each one of them defined this distribution along their way.

48
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,600
And remember, this is not meant to be a lesson about cube shadows per se, but a lesson about problem solving,

49
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,700
told through the lens of two different mindsets that we might bring to the puzzle.

50
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,900
And as with any lesson on problem solving, the goal here is not to get to the answer as quickly as we can,

51
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,900
but hopefully for you to feel like you found the answer yourself.

52
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,700
So if ever there's a point when you feel like you might have an idea, give yourself the freedom to pause and try to think it through.

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,000
As a first step, and this is really independent of any particular problem solving styles, just any time you find a hard question,

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,400
a good thing that you can do is ask, what's the simplest possible, non-trivial variant of the problem that you can try to solve?

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,000
So in our case, what you might say is, okay, let's forget about averaging over all the orientations.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
That's a tricky thing to think about.

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,300
And let's even forget about all the different faces of the cube, because they overlap, and that's also tricky to think about.

58
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,600
Just for one particular face, and one particular orientation, can we compute the area of this shadow?

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,500
Once more, if you want to get your bearings with some special cases, the easiest is when that face is parallel to the ground,

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,200
in which case the area of the shadow is the same as the area of the face.

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,200
And on the other hand, if we were to tilt that face 90 degrees, then its shadow will be a straight line, and it has an area of zero.

62
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,800
So Bob looks at this, and he wants an actual formula for that shadow.

63
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,200
And the way he might think about it is to consider the normal vector perpendicular off of that face.

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:31,100
And what seems relevant is the angle that that normal vector makes with the vertical, with the direction where the light is coming from, which we might call theta.

65
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,700
Now, from the two special cases we just looked at, we know that when theta is equal to zero,

66
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,200
the area of that shadow is the same as the area of the shape itself, which is s squared if the square has side lengths s.

67
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,200
And if theta is equal to 90 degrees, then the area of that shadow is zero.

68
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,900
And it's probably not too hard to guess that trigonometry will be somehow relevant,

69
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,000
so anyone comfortable with their trig functions could probably hazard a guess as to what the right formula is.

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,300
But Bob is more detail-oriented than that.

71
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,700
He wants to properly prove what that area should be, rather than just making a guess based on the endpoints.

72
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,000
And the way you might think about it could be something like this.

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,900
If we consider the plane that passes through the vertical as well as our normal vector,

74
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,700
and then we consider all the different slices of our shape that are in that plane, or parallel to that plane,

75
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,400
then we can focus our attention on a two-dimensional variant of the problem.

76
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,700
If we just look at one of those slices, who has a normal vector, an angle theta away from the vertical,

77
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,200
its shadow might look something like this.

78
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,400
And if we draw a vertical line up to the left here, we have ourselves a right triangle.

79
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,400
And from here we can do a little bit of angle chasing, where we follow around what that angle theta implies about the rest of the diagram.

80
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,400
And this means the lower right angle in this triangle is precisely theta.

81
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,400
So, when we want to understand the size of this shadow in comparison to the original size of the piece,

82
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,600
we can think about the cosine of that angle, theta, which remembers the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

83
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,900
It's literally the ratio between the size of the shadow and the size of the slice.

84
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,100
So, the factor by which the slice gets squished down in this direction is exactly cosine of theta.

85
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,600
And if we broaden our view to the entire square, all the slices in that direction get scaled by the same factor.

86
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,600
But in the other direction, in the one perpendicular to that slice, there is no stretching or squishing,

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
because the face is not at all tilted in that direction.

88
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:26,100
So overall, the two-dimensional shadow of our two-dimensional face should also be scaled down by this factor of a cosine of theta.

89
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,600
It lines up with what you might intuitively guess, given the case where the angle is 0° and the case where it's 90°,

90
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
but it's reassuring to see why it's true.

91
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,100
And actually, as stated so far, this is not quite correct. There is a small problem with the formula that we've written.

92
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,600
In the case where theta is bigger than 90°, the cosine would actually come out to be negative.

93
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,600
But of course, we don't want to consider the shadow to have negative area, at least not in a problem like this.

94
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,100
So there's two different ways you could solve this.

95
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,600
You could say we only ever want to consider the normal vector that is pointing up, that has a positive z component.

96
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,100
Or, more simply, we could say, just take the absolute value of that cosine,

97
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
and that gives us a valid formula.

98
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,100
So Bob's happy because he has a precise formula describing the area of the shadow.

99
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,100
But Alice starts to think about it a little bit differently.

100
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,600
She says, okay, we've got some shape, and then we apply a rotation that sort of situates it into 3D space in some way.

101
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,100
And then we apply a flat projection that shoves that back into two-dimensional space.

102
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
And what stands out to her is that both of these are linear transformations.

103
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,600
That means that in principle you could describe each one of them with a matrix,

104
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
and that the overall transformation would look like the product of those two matrices.

105
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,100
What Alice knows from one of her favorite subjects, linear algebra,

106
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,100
is that if you take some shape and you consider its area, then you apply some linear transformation,

107
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,600
then the area of that output looks like some constant times the original area of the shape.

108
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,100
More specifically, we have a name for that constant. It's called the determinant of the transformation.

109
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,600
If you're not so comfortable with linear algebra, we could give a much more intuitive description and say,

110
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,100
if you uniformly stretch the original shape in some direction,

111
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,600
the output will also uniformly get stretched in some direction.

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,100
So the area of each of them should scale in proportion to each other.

113
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Now in principle, Alice could compute this determinant, but it's not really her style to do that,

114
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
at least not to do so immediately.

115
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Instead, the thing that she writes down is how this proportionality constant between our original shape and its shadow

116
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,100
does not depend on the original shape.

117
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,600
We could be talking about the shadow of this cat outline, or anything else, and the size of it doesn't really matter.

118
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,600
The only thing affecting that proportionality constant is what transformation we're applying,

119
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,100
which in this context means we could write it down as some factor that depends on the rotation being applied to the shape.

120
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,100
In the back of our mind, because of Bob's calculation, we know what that factor looks like.

121
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,600
You know, it's the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the normal vector and the vertical.

122
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,100
But Alice right now is just saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can think about that eventually when I want to.

123
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,600
But she knows we're about to average over all the different orientations anyway,

124
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,100
though she holds out some hope that any specific formula about a specific orientation might get washed away in that average.

125
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,600
Now it's easy to look at this and say, okay, well Alice isn't really doing anything then.

126
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Of course the area of the shadow is proportional to the area of the original shape.

127
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,100
They're both two-dimensional quantities, they should both scale like two-dimensional things.

128
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,600
But keep in mind, this would not at all be true if we were dealing with the harder case that has a closer light source.

129
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,100
In that case, the projection is not linear.

130
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,600
For example, if I rotate this cat so that its tail ends up quite close to the light source,

131
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,100
then if I stretch the original shape uniformly in the x-direction, say by a factor of 1.5,

132
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,600
it might have a very disproportionate effect on the ultimate shadow,

133
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,100
because the tail gets very disproportionately blown up as it gets really close to the light.

134
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Again, Alice is keeping an eye out for what properties of the problem are actually relevant,

135
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
because that helps her know how much she can generalize things.

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Does the fact that we're thinking about a square face and not some other shape matter?

137
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
No, not really.

138
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Does the fact that the transformation is linear matter?

139
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,100
Yes, absolutely.

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Alice can also apply a similar way of thinking about the average shadow for any shape like this.

141
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Say we have some sequence of rotations that we apply to our square face,

142
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
and let's call them R1, R2, R3, and so on.

143
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,600
Then the area of the shadow in each one of those cases looks like some factor times the area of the square,

144
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
and that factor depends on the rotation.

145
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,100
So if we take an empirical average for that shadow across the sample of rotations we're looking at right now,

146
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,600
the way it looks is to add up all of those shadow areas and then divide by the total number that we have.

147
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,100
Now, because of the linearity, this area of the original square can cleanly factor out of all of that,

148
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
and it ends up on the left.

149
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,100
This isn't the exact average that we're looking for, it's just an empirical mean of a sample of rotations,

150
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,100
but in principle what we're looking for is what this approaches as the size of our sample approaches infinity,

151
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
and all the parts that depend on the size of the sample sit cleanly away from the area itself.

152
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,600
So whatever this approaches in the limit, it's just going to be some number.

153
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
It might be a royal pain to compute, we're not sure about that yet,

154
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,600
but the thing that Alice notes is that it's independent of the size and the shape of the particular 2D thing that we're looking at.

155
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
It's a universal proportionality constant,

156
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,600
and her hope is that that universality somehow lends itself to a more elegant way to deduce what it must be.

157
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,600
Now Bob would be eager to compute this constant here and now,

158
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
and in a few minutes I'll show you how he does it.

159
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
But before that I do want to stay in Alice's world for a little bit more,

160
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
because this is where things start to really get fun.

161
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,600
In her desire to understand the overall structure of the question before diving into the details,

162
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,600
she's curious now about how the area of the shadow of the cube relates to the area of its individual faces.

163
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Now if we can say something about the average area of a particular face,

164
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
does that tell us anything about the average area of the cube as a whole?

165
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,600
For example, a simple thing we could say is that that area is definitely less than the sum of the areas across all the faces,

166
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
because there's a meaningful amount of overlap between those shadows.

167
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
But it's not entirely clear how to think about that overlap,

168
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
because if we focus our attention just on two particular faces,

169
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,600
in some orientations they don't overlap at all,

170
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
but in other orientations they do have some overlap,

171
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,600
and the specific shape and area of that overlap seems a little bit tricky to think about,

172
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,600
much less how on Earth we would average that across all of the different orientations.

173
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,600
But Alice has about three clever insights through this whole problem, and this is the first one of them.

174
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,600
She says, actually, if we think about the whole cube, not just a pair of faces,

175
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:48,600
we can conclude that the area of the shadow for a given orientation is exactly one half the sum of the areas of all of the faces.

176
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Intuitively you can maybe guess that half of them are bathed in the light and half of them are not,

177
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
but here's the way that she justifies it.

178
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,600
She says for a particular ray of light, they would go from the sky and eventually hit a point in the shadow.

179
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
That ray passes through the cube at exactly two points.

180
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
There's one moment when it enters and one moment when it exits.

181
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,600
So every point in that shadow corresponds to exactly two faces above it.

182
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Well, okay, that's not exactly true if that beam of light happened to go through the edge of one of the squares.

183
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,600
There's a little bit of ambiguity on how many faces it's passing,

184
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,600
but those account for zero area inside the shadow, so we're safe to ignore them if the thing we're trying to do is compute the area.

185
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,600
If Alice is pressed and she needs to justify why exactly this is true,

186
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,600
which is important for understanding how the problem might generalize,

187
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,600
she can appeal to the idea of convexity.

188
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Convexity is one of those properties where a lot of us have an intuitive sense for what it should mean,

189
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
you know, it's shapes that just bulge out, they never dent inward.

190
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,600
But mathematicians have a pretty clever way of formalizing it that's helpful for actual proofs.

191
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,600
They say that a set is convex if the line that connects any two points inside that set is entirely contained within the set itself.

192
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,600
So a square is convex because no matter where you put two points inside that square,

193
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
the line connecting them is entirely contained inside the square.

194
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
But something like the symbol pi is not convex.

195
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I can easily find two different points so that the line connecting them has to peak outside of the set itself.

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
None of the letters in the word convex are themselves convex.

197
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You can find two points so that the line connecting them has to pass outside of the set.

198
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
It's a really clever way to formalize this idea of a shape that only bulges out,

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
because any time that it dents inward, you can find these counterexample lines.

200
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Our cube, because it's convex, between the first point of entry and the last point of exit,

201
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,600
it has to stay entirely inside the cube by definition of convexity.

202
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,600
But if we were dealing with some other non-convex shape, like a donut,

203
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
you could find a ray of light that enters, then exits, then enters, then exits again,

204
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
so you wouldn't have a clean two-to-one cover from the shadows.

205
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,600
The shadows of all of its different parts, if you were to cover this in a bunch of faces,

206
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
would not be precisely two times the area of the shadow itself.

207
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,600
So, that's the first key insight, the face shadows double cover the cube shadow.

208
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,600
And the next one is a little bit more symbolic, so let's start things off by abbreviating our notation a little to make room on the screen.

209
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Instead of writing the area of the shadow of the cube, I'm just going to write s of the cube.

210
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,600
And similarly, instead of the area of the shadow of a particular face, I'm just going to write s of f,

211
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
where that subscript j indicates which face I'm talking about.

212
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,600
But of course, we should really be talking about the shadow of a particular rotation applied to the cube.

213
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
So I might write this as s of some rotation applied to the cube,

214
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,600
and likewise on the right, it's the area of the shadow of that same rotation applied to a given one of the faces.

215
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,600
With the more compact notation at hand, let's think about the average of this shadow area across many different rotations,

216
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
some sample of r1, r2, r3, and so on.

217
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Again, that average just involves adding up all of those shadow areas and then dividing them by n.

218
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,600
And in principle, if we were to look at this for larger and larger samples, let n approach infinity,

219
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
that would give us the average area of the shadow of the cube.

220
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Some of you might be thinking, yes, we know this, you've said this already,

221
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,600
but it's beneficial to write it out so that we can understand why it is that expressing the shadow area for a particular rotation of the cube

222
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,600
as a sum across all of its faces, or one half times that sum at least,

223
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
why is that beneficial? What is it going to do for us?

224
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Well, let's just write it out, where for each one of these rotations of the cube,

225
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,600
we could break down that shadow as a sum across that same rotation applied across all of the faces.

226
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
And when it's written as a grid like this, we can get to Alice's second insight,

227
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,600
which is to shift the way that we're thinking about the sum from going row by row to instead going column by column.

228
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
For example, if we focused our attention just on the first column,

229
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,600
what it's telling us is to add up the area of the shadow of the first face across many different orientations.

230
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,600
So if we were to take that sum and divide it by the size of our sample,

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,600
that gives us an empirical average for the area of the shadow of this face.

232
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
So if we take larger and larger samples, letting that size go to infinity,

233
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
this will approach the average shadow area for a square.

234
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Likewise, the second column can be thought of as telling us the average area for the second face of the cube,

235
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
which should of course be the same number.

236
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,600
And same deal for any other column, it's telling us the average area for a particular face.

237
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
So that gives us a very different way of thinking about our whole expression.

238
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Instead of saying add up the areas of the cubes at all the different orientations,

239
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,600
we could say just add up the average shadows for the six different faces and divide the total by one half.

240
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
The term on the left here is thinking about adding up rows first,

241
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
and the term on the right is thinking about adding up columns first.

242
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,600
In short, the average of the sum of the face shadows is the same as the sum of the average of the face shadows.

243
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Maybe that swap seems simple, maybe it doesn't,

244
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,600
but I can tell you that there is actually a little bit more than meets the eye to the step that we just took,

245
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
but we'll get to that later.

246
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
And remember, we know that the average area for a particular face

247
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,600
looks like some universal proportionality constant times the area of that face.

248
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
So if we're adding this up across all the faces of the cube,

249
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,600
we could think of this as equaling some constant times the surface area of the cube.

250
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
And that's pretty interesting.

251
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,600
The average area for the shadow of this cube is going to be proportional to its surface area.

252
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
But at the same time, you might complain,

253
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
well Alice is just pushing around a bunch of symbols here,

254
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,600
because none of this matters if we don't know what that proportionality constant is.

255
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
I mean, it almost seems obvious.

256
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Like, of course the average shadow area should be proportional to the surface area.

257
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
They're both two-dimensional quantities, so they should scale in lockstep with each other.

258
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I mean, it's not obvious.

259
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
After all, for a closer light source, it simply wouldn't be true.

260
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,600
And also, this business where we added up the grid column by column versus row by row

261
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
is a little more nuanced than it might look at first.

262
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
There's a subtle, hidden assumption underlying all of this,

263
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
which carries a special significance when we choose to revisit the question

264
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,600
of what probability distribution is being taken across the space of all orientations.

265
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
But more than anything, the reason that it's not obvious

266
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
is that the significance of this result right here

267
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
is not merely that these two values are proportional.

268
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
It's that an analogous fact will hold true for any convex solids,

269
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,600
and, crucially, the actual content of what Alice has built up so far

270
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,600
is that it'll be the same proportionality constant across all of them.

271
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Now if you really mull over that, some of you may be able to predict

272
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
the way that Alice is able to finish things off from here.

273
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,600
It's really delightful. It's honestly my main reason for covering this topic.

274
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
But before we get into it, I think it's easy to underappreciate her result

275
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
unless we dig into the details of what it is that she manages to avoid.

276
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
So let's take a moment to turn our attention back into Bob's world,

277
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
because while Alice has been doing all of this,

278
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
he's been busy doing some computations.

279
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,600
In fact, what he's been working on is finding exactly what Alice has yet to figure out,

280
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
which is how to take the formula that he found for the area of a square's shadow

281
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
and taking the natural next step of trying to find the average of that square's shadow

282
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,600
averaged over all possible orientations.

283
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,600
So the way Bob starts, if he's thinking about all the different possible orientations for this square,

284
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,600
is to ask, what are all the different normal vectors that that square can have in all these orientations,

285
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
because everything about its shadow comes down to that normal vector.

286
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,600
It's not too hard to see that all those possible normal vectors trace out the surface of a sphere.

287
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
If we assume it's a unit normal vector, it's a sphere with radius 1.

288
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,600
And furthermore, Bob figures that each point of this sphere should be just as likely to occur as any other.

289
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Our probabilities should be uniform in that way. There's no reason to prefer one direction over another.

290
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,600
But in the context of continuous probabilities, it's not very helpful to talk about the likelihood of a particular individual point,

291
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,600
because in the uncountable infinity of points on the sphere, that would be zero and unhelpful.

292
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
So instead, the more precise way to phrase this uniformity

293
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,600
would be to say the probability that our normal vector lands in any given patch of area on the sphere

294
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
should be proportional to that area itself.

295
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,600
More specifically, it should equal the area of that little patch divided by the total surface area of the sphere.

296
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,600
If that's true, no matter what patch of area we're considering, that's what we mean by a uniform distribution on the sphere.

297
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Now to be clear, points on the sphere are not the same thing as orientations in 3D space,

298
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
because even if you know what normal vector this square is going to have, that leaves us with another degree of freedom.

299
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
The square could be rotated about that normal vector.

300
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,600
But Bob doesn't actually have to care about that extra degree of freedom, because in all of those cases, the area of the shadow is the same.

301
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,600
It's only dependent on the cosine of the angle between that normal vector and the vertical.

302
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Which is kind of neat. All those shadows are genuinely different shapes. They're not the same.

303
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
But the area of each of them will be the same.

304
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,600
What this means is that when Bob wants this average shadow area over all possible orientations,

305
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,600
all he really needs to know is the average value of this absolute value of cosine of theta

306
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,600
for all different possible normal vectors, all different possible points on the sphere.

307
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
So, how do you compute an average like this?

308
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Well, if we lived in some kind of discrete pixelated world, where there's only a finite number of possible angles theta that that normal vector could have,

309
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
the average would be pretty straightforward.

310
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,600
What you do is find the probability of landing on any particular value of theta,

311
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,600
which will tell us something like how much of the sphere do normal vectors with that angle make up,

312
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,600
and then you multiply it by the thing we want to take the average of, this formula for the area of the shadow.

313
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:44,600
And then you would add that up over all of the different possible values of theta, ranging from 0 up to 180 degrees, or pi radians.

314
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,600
But of course, in reality, there is a continuum of possible values of theta, this uncountable infinity,

315
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,600
and the probability of landing on any specific particular value of theta will actually be 0.

316
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
And so a sum like this unfortunately doesn't really make any sense,

317
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,600
or if it does make sense, adding up infinitely many zeros should just give us a 0.

318
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,600
The short answer for what we do instead is that we compute an integral.

319
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,600
And I'll level with you, the hard part here is I'm not entirely sure what background I should be assuming from those of you watching right now.

320
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Maybe it's the case that you're quite comfortable with calculus and you don't need me to belabor the point here.

321
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Maybe it's the case that you're not familiar with calculus and I shouldn't just be throwing down integrals like that.

322
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Or maybe you took a calculus class a while ago but you need a little bit of a refresher.

323
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I'm going to go with the option of setting this up as if it's a calculus lesson,

324
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,600
because to be honest, even when you are quite comfortable with integrals, setting them up can be kind of an error-prone process,

325
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,600
and calling back to the underlying definition is a good way to sort of check yourself in the process.

326
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,600
If we lived in a time before calculus existed and integrals weren't a thing, and we wanted to approximate an answer to this question,

327
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,600
one way we could go about it is to take a sample of values for θ that ranges from 0 up to 180°.

328
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,600
We might think of them as evenly spaced with some sort of difference between each one, some delta θ.

329
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,600
And it's still the case that it would be unhelpful to ask about the probability of a particular value of θ occurring, even if it's 1 in our sample.

330
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
That probability would still be 0 and it would be unhelpful.

331
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,600
But what is helpful to ask is the probability of falling between two different values from our sample,

332
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
in this little band of latitude with a width of delta θ.

333
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Based on our assumption that the distribution along this sphere should be uniform, that probability comes down to knowing the area of this band.

334
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,600
More specifically, the chances that a randomly chosen vector lands in that band should be that area divided by the total surface area of the sphere.

335
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:45,600
To figure out that area, let's first think of the radius of that band, which, if the radius of our sphere is 1, is definitely going to be smaller than 1.

336
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,600
And in fact, if we draw the appropriate little right triangle here, you can see that that little radius, let's just say at the top of the band,

337
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
should be the sine of our angle, the sine of θ.

338
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,600
This means that the circumference of the band should be 2π times the sine of that angle,

339
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,600
and then the area of the band should be that circumference times its thickness, that little delta θ.

340
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Or rather, the area of our band is approximately this quantity.

341
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,600
What's important is that for a finer sample of many more values of θ, the accuracy of that approximation would get better and better.

342
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Now remember, the reason we wanted this area is to know the probability of falling into that band,

343
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,600
which is this area divided by the surface area of the sphere, which we know to be 4π times its radius squared.

344
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
That's a value that you could also compute with an integral similar to the one that we're setting up now,

345
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,600
but for now we can take it as a given, as a standard well-known formula.

346
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,600
And this probability itself is just a stepping stone in the direction of what we actually want,

347
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,600
which is the average area for the shadow of a square.

348
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,600
To get that, we'll multiply this probability times the corresponding shadow area,

349
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,600
which is this absolute value of cosθ expression we've seen many times up to this point.

350
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
And our estimate for this average would now come down to adding up this expression

351
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
across all of the different bands, all of the different samples of θ that we've taken.

352
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,600
This right here, by the way, is when Bob is just totally in his element.

353
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,600
We've got a lot of exact formulas describing something very concrete, actually digging in on our way to a real answer.

354
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,600
And again, if it feels like a lot of detail, I want you to appreciate that fact,

355
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,600
so that you can appreciate just how magical it is when Alice manages to somehow avoid all of this.

356
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Anyway, looking back at our expression, let's clean things up a little bit,

357
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,600
like factoring out all of the terms that don't depend on θ itself.

358
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,600
And we can simplify that 2π divided by 4π to simply be 1 half.

359
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,600
And to make it a little more analogous to calculus, with integrals, let me just swap the main terms inside the sum here.

360
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,600
What we now have, this sum that's going to approximate the answer to our question, is almost what an integral is.

361
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Instead of writing the sigma for sum, we write the integral symbol,

362
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,600
this kind of elongated Leibnizian s, showing us that we're going from 0 to π.

363
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,600
And instead of describing the step size as δθ, a concrete finite amount,

364
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,600
we instead describe it as dθ, which I like to think of as signaling the fact that some kind of limit is being taken.

365
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,600
What that integral means, by definition, is whatever the sum on the bottom approaches for finer and finer subdivisions,

366
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,600
more dense samples that we might take for θ itself.

367
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,600
And at this point, for those of you who do know calculus, I'll just write down the details of how you would actually carry this out,

368
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
as you might see it written down in Bob's notebook.

369
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,600
It's the usual anti-derivative stuff, but the one key step is to bring in a certain trig identity.

370
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:43,600
In the end, what Bob finds after doing this is the surprisingly clean fact that the average area for a square's shadow is precisely one half the area of that square.

371
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
This is the mystery constant, which Alice doesn't yet know.

372
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,600
If Bob were to look over her shoulder and see the work that she's done, he could finish out the problem right now.

373
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
He plugs in the constant that he just found, and he knows the final answer.

374
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,600
And now, finally, with all of this as backdrop, what is it that Alice does to carry out the final solution?

375
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
I introduced her as someone who really likes to generalize the results she finds.

376
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,600
And usually those generalizations end up as interesting footnotes that aren't really material for solving particular problems.

377
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
But this is a case where the generalization itself draws her to a quantitative result.

378
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Remember, the substance of what she's found so far is that if you look at any convex solid,

379
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,600
then the average area for its shadow is going to be proportional to its surface area,

380
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,600
and critically, it'll be the same proportionality constant across all of these solids.

381
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:44,600
So all Alice needs to do is find just a single convex solid out there where she already knows the average area of its shadow.

382
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,600
And some of you may see where this is going. The most symmetric solid available to us is a sphere.

383
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:58,600
No matter what the orientation of that sphere, its shadow, the flat projection shadow, is always a circle with an area of πr².

384
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
So in particular, that's its average shadow area.

385
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,600
And the surface area of a sphere, like I mentioned before, is exactly 4πr².

386
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
By the way, I did make a video talking all about that surface area formula

387
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,600
and how Archimedes proved it thousands of years before calculus existed, so you don't need integrals to find it.

388
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,600
The magic of what Alice has done is that she can take this seemingly specific fact, that the shadow of a sphere has an area exactly 1⁄4 its surface area,

389
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:33,600
and use it to conclude a much more general fact, that for any convex solid out there, its shadow and surface area are related in the same way, in a certain sense.

390
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:43,600
So with that, she can go and fill in the details of the particular question about a cube, and say that its average shadow area will be 1⁄4 times its surface area, 6s².

391
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,600
But the much more memorable fact that you'll go to sleep thinking about is how it didn't really matter that we were talking about a cube at all.

392
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Now, that's all very pretty, but some of you might complain that this isn't really a valid argument, because spheres don't have flat faces.

393
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:08,600
When I said Alice's argument generalizes to any convex solid, if we actually look at the argument itself, it definitely depends on the use of a finite number of flat faces.

394
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:20,600
For example, if we were mapping it to a dodecahedron, you would start by saying that the area of a particular shadow of that dodecahedron looks like exactly 1⁄2 times the sum of the areas of the shadows of all its faces.

395
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Once again, you could use a certain ray of light mixed with convexity argument to draw that conclusion.

396
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:35,600
And remember, the benefit of expressing that shadow area as a sum is that when we want to average over a bunch of different rotations, we can describe that sum as a big grid,

397
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,600
where we can then go column by column and consider the average area for the shadow of each face.

398
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,600
And also, a critical fact was the conclusion from much earlier, that the average shadow for any 2D object, a flat 2D object, which is important,

399
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,600
will equal some universal proportionality constant times its area.

400
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:00,600
The significance was that that constant didn't depend on the shape itself. It could have been a square, or a cat, or the pentagonal faces of our dodecahedron, whatever.

401
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:08,600
So, after hastily carrying this over to a sphere that doesn't have a finite number of flat faces, you would be right to complain.

402
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
But luckily, it's a pretty easy detail to fill in.

403
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:21,600
What you can do is imagine a sequence of different polyhedra that successively approximate a sphere, in the sense that their faces hug tighter and tighter around the genuine surface of the sphere.

404
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:30,600
For each one of those approximations, we can draw the same conclusion, that its average shadow is going to be proportional to its surface area with this universal proportionality constant.

405
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,600
So then, if we say, okay, let's take the limit of the ratio between the average shadow area at each step and the surface area at each step,

406
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,600
well, since that ratio is never changing, it's always equal to this constant, then in the limit, it's also going to equal that constant.

407
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:52,600
But on the other hand, by their definition, in the limit, their average shadow area should be that of a circle, which is πr²,

408
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,600
and the limit of the surface areas would be the surface area of the sphere, 4πr².

409
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,600
So we do genuinely get the conclusion that intuition would suggest, but, as is so common with Alice's argument here,

410
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,600
we do have to be a little delicate in how we justify that intuition.

411
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:19,600
It's easy for this contrast of Alice and Bob to come across like a value judgment, as if I'm saying, look how clever Alice has managed to be,

412
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
she insightfully avoided all those computations that Bob had to do.

413
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,600
But that would be a very, um, misguided conclusion.

414
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,600
I think there's an important way that popularizations of math differ from the feeling of actually doing math.

415
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,600
There's this bias towards showing the slick proofs, the arguments with some clever keen insight that lets you avoid doing calculations.

416
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:46,600
I could just be projecting, since I'm very guilty of this, but what I can tell you, sitting on the other side of the screen here,

417
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,600
is that it feels a lot more attractive to make a video about Alice's approach than Bob's.

418
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,600
For one thing, in Alice's approach, the line of reasoning is fun, it has these nice aha moments.

419
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:03,600
But also, crucially, the way that you explain it is more or less the same for a very wide range of mathematical backgrounds.

420
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,600
It's much less enticing to do a video about Bob's approach, not because the computations are all that bad, I mean, they're honestly not,

421
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:18,600
but the pragmatic reality is that the appropriate pace to explain it looks very different depending on the different mathematical backgrounds in the audience.

422
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:26,600
So, you, watching this right now, clearly consume math videos online, and I think in doing so it's worth being aware of this bias.

423
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:34,600
If the aim is to have a genuine lesson on problem solving, too much focus on the slick proofs runs the risk of being disingenuous.

424
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,600
For example, let's say we were to step up to challenge mode here and ask about the case with a closer light source.

425
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,600
To my knowledge, there is not a similarly slick solution to Alice's here, where you can just relate to a single shape like a sphere.

426
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,600
The much more productive warmup to have done would have been the calculus of Bob's approach.

427
00:35:52,600 --> 00:36:03,600
And if you look at the history of this problem, it was proved by Cauchy in 1832, and if we paw through his handwritten notes, they look a lot more similar to Bob's work than Alice's work.

428
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Right here at the top of page 11, you can see what is essentially the same integral that you and I set up in the middle.

429
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,600
On the other hand, the whole framing of the paper is to find a general fact, not something specific like the case of a cube.

430
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:25,600
So if we were asking the question which of these two mindsets correlates with the act of discovering new math, the right answer would almost certainly have to be a blend of both.

431
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:33,600
But I would suggest that many people don't sign enough weight to the part of that blend where you're eager to dive into calculations.

432
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
And I think there's some risk that the videos I make might contribute to that.

433
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:47,600
In the podcast I did with the mathematician Alex Kontorovich, he talked about the often underappreciated importance of just drilling on computations to build intuition,

434
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,600
whether you're a student engaging with a new class, or a practicing research mathematician engaging with a new field of study.

435
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,600
A listener actually wrote in to highlight what an impression that particular section made.

436
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:07,600
They're a PhD student and describe themselves as being worried that their mathematical abilities were starting to fade, which they attributed to becoming older and less sharp.

437
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:16,600
But hearing a practicing mathematician talk about the importance of doing hundreds of concrete examples in order to learn something new, evidently that changed their perspective.

438
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,600
In their own words, recognizing this completely reshaped their outlook and their results.

439
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:30,600
And if you look at the famous mathematicians through history, Newton, Euler, Gauss, all of them, they all have this seemingly infinite patience for doing tedious calculations.

440
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:42,600
The irony of being biased to show insights that let us avoid calculations is that the way people often train up the intuitions to find those insights in the first place is by doing piles and piles of calculations.

441
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,600
All that said, something would definitely be missing without the Alice mindset here.

442
00:37:49,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I mean, think about it, how sad would it be if we solved this problem for a cube, and we never stepped outside of the trees to see the forest and understand that this is a super general fact, it applies to a huge family of shapes.

443
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:14,600
And if you consider that math is not just about answering the questions that are posed to you, but about introducing new ideas and constructs, one fun side note about Alice's approach here is that it suggests a fun way to quantify the idea of convexity.

444
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Rather than just having a yes-no answer, is it convex, is it not, we could put a number to it by saying, consider the average area of the shadow of some solid, multiply that by 4, divide it by the surface area, and if that number is 1, you've got a convex solid, but if it's less than 1, it's non-convex, and how close it is to 1 tells you how close it is to being convex.

445
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Also, one of the nice things about the Alice solution here is that it helps explain why it is that mathematicians have what can sometimes look like a bizarre infatuation with generality and with abstraction.

446
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:57,600
The more examples that you see where generalizing and abstracting actually helps you to solve a specific case, the more you start to adopt the same infatuation.

447
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:07,600
And as a final thought for the stalwart viewers among you who have stuck through it this far, there is still one unanswered question about the very premise of our puzzle.

448
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,600
What exactly does it mean to choose a random orientation?

449
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Now if that feels like a silly question, like of course we know what it should mean, I would encourage you to watch a video that I just did with Numberphile on a conundrum from probability known as Bertrand's paradox.

450
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:30,600
After you watch it, and if you appreciate some of the nuance at play here, homework for you is to reflect on where exactly Alice and Bob implicitly answer to this question.

451
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:41,600
The case with Bob is relatively straightforward, but the point at which Alice locks down some specific distribution on the space of all orientations, well it's not at all obvious, it's actually very subtle.
