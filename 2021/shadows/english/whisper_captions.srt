1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
In a moment I'm going to tell you about a certain really nice puzzle involving the shadow of a cube.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,400
But before we get to that, I should say that the point of this video is not exactly the puzzle per se,

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,240
it's about two distinct problem-solving styles that are reflected in two different ways that we can tackle this problem.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,700
In fact, let's anthropomorphize those two different styles by imagining two students, Alice and Bob, that embody each one of the approaches.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,980
So Bob will be the kind of student who really loves calculation.

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,820
As soon as there's a moment when he can dig into the details and get a very concrete view of the concrete situation in front of him,

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,340
that's where he's the most pleased.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,900
Alice on the other hand is more inclined to procrastinate the computations,

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,220
not because she doesn't know how to do them or doesn't want to per se,

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,740
but she prefers to get a nice high-level general overview of the kind of problem she's dealing with,

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,360
the general shape that it has before she digs into the computations themselves.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,200
She's most pleased if she understands not just the specific question sitting in front of her,

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,780
but also the broadest possible way that you could generalize it,

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,380
and especially if the more general view can lend itself to more swift and elegant computations,

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,940
once she does actually sit down to carry them out.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,140
Now the puzzle that both of them are going to be faced with is to find the average area for the shadow of a cube.

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,320
So if I have a cube kind of sitting here hovering in space,

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,460
there are a few things that influence the area of its shadow.

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,260
One obvious one would be the size of the cube, smaller cube, smaller shadow.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,080
But also if it's sitting at different orientations,

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,160
those orientations correspond to different particular shadows with different areas.

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,040
And when I say find the average here, what I mean is average over all possible orientations

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,100
for a particular size of the cube.

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,100
The astute among you might point out that it also matters a lot where the light source is.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,660
If the light source were very low, close to the cube itself, then the shadow ends up larger.

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,200
And if the light source were kind of positioned laterally off to the side,

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,560
this can distort the shadow and give it a very different shape.

28
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,660
Accounting for that light position stands to be highly interesting in its own right,

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,320
but the puzzle is hard enough as it is, so at least initially, let's do the easiest thing we can

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,380
and say that the light is directly above the cube and really far away,

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,860
effectively infinitely far, so that all we're considering is a flat projection,

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,240
in the sense that if you look at any coordinates, x, y, z, in space,

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,700
the flat projection would be x, y, 0.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,300
So, just to get our bearings, the easiest situation to think about would be if the cube is straight up,

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
with two of its faces parallel to the ground.

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,780
In that case, this flat projection shadow is simply a square,

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,900
and if we say the side lengths of the cube are s, then the area of that shadow is sÂ².

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,460
And by the way, any time that I have a label up on these animations, like the one down here,

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,460
I'll be assuming that the relevant cube has a side length of 1.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Now, another special case among all the orientations that's fun to think about

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,040
is if the long diagonal is parallel to the direction of the light.

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,120
In that case, the shadow actually looks like a regular hexagon,

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
and if you use some of the methods that we will develop in a few minutes,

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,580
you can compute that the area of that shadow is exactly the square root of 3

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,820
times the area of one of the square faces.

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,200
But of course, more often, the actual shadow will be not so regular as a square or a hexagon.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,240
It's some harder to think about shape, based on some harder to think about orientation for this cube.

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,720
Earlier, I casually threw out this phrase of averaging over all possible orientations,

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,300
but you could rightly ask, what exactly is that supposed to mean?

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,440
I think a lot of us have an intuitive feel for what we want it to mean,

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,860
at least in the sense of what experiment would you do to verify it.

52
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,200
You might imagine tossing this cube in the air, like a die, freezing it at some arbitrary point,

53
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,440
recording the area of the shadow from that position, and then repeating.

54
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,380
If you do this many many times, over and over, you can take the mean of your sample.

55
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,720
The number that we want to get at, the true average here,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,540
should be whatever that experimental mean approaches as you do more and more tosses,

57
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,940
approaching infinitely many.

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Even still, the sticklers among you could complain that doesn't really answer the question,

59
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,800
because it leaves open the issue of how we're defining a random toss.

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,840
The proper way to answer this, if we want it to be more formal,

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,920
would be to first describe the space of all possible orientations,

62
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,540
which mathematicians have actually given a fancy name.

63
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,440
They call it SO3, typically defined in terms of a certain family of 3x3 matrices.

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,760
And the question we want to answer is, what probability distribution are we putting to this entire space?

65
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,000
It's only when such a probability distribution is well-defined,

66
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,500
that we can answer a question involving an average.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,660
If you are a stickler for that kind of thing,

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,820
I want you to hold off on that question until the end of the video.

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,740
You'll be surprised at how far we can get with the more heuristic, experimental idea

70
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,580
of just repeating a bunch of random tosses without really defining the distribution.

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,080
Once we see Alice and Bob's solutions,

72
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,480
it's actually very interesting to ask how exactly each one of them defined this distribution along their way.

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,400
And remember, this is not meant to be a lesson about cube shadows per se,

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,280
but a lesson about problem solving,

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,100
told through the lens of two different mindsets that we might bring to the puzzle.

76
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,560
And as with any lesson on problem solving,

77
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,760
the goal here is not to get to the answer as quickly as we can,

78
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,720
but hopefully for you to feel like you found the answer yourself.

79
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,240
So if ever there's a point when you feel like you might have an idea,

80
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,820
give yourself the freedom to pause and try to think it through.

81
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,620
As a first step, and this is really independent of any particular problem solving style,

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,460
just any time you find a hard question,

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,620
a good thing that you can do is ask,

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,540
what's the simplest possible, non-trivial variant of the problem that you can try to solve?

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,280
So in our case, what you might say is,

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
okay, let's forget about averaging over all the orientations.

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,420
That's a tricky thing to think about.

88
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,200
And let's even forget about all the different faces of the cube,

89
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,860
because they overlap, and that's also tricky to think about.

90
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,500
Just for one particular face, and one particular orientation,

91
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,900
can we compute the area of this shadow?

92
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,280
Once more, if you want to get your bearings with some special cases,

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,220
the easiest is when that face is parallel to the ground,

94
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,680
in which case the area of the shadow is the same as the area of the face.

95
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,080
And on the other hand, if we were to tilt that face 90 degrees,

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,440
then its shadow will be a straight line, and it has an area of zero.

97
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,420
So Bob looks at this, and he wants an actual formula for that shadow.

98
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,700
And the way he might think about it is to consider the normal vector perpendicular off of that face.

99
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,920
And what seems relevant is the angle that that normal vector makes with the vertical,

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,080
with the direction where the light is coming from, which we might call theta.

101
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,220
Now, from the two special cases we just looked at, we know that when theta is equal to zero,

102
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,880
the area of that shadow is the same as the area of the shape itself,

103
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,560
which is s squared if the square has side lengths s.

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,800
And if theta is equal to 90 degrees, then the area of that shadow is zero.

105
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,580
And it's probably not too hard to guess that trigonometry will be somehow relevant,

106
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,620
so anyone comfortable with their trig functions could probably hazard a guess as to what the right formula is.

107
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,120
But Bob is more detail-oriented than that.

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,020
He wants to properly prove what that area should be, rather than just making a guess based on the endpoints.

109
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,740
And the way you might think about it could be something like this.

110
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,380
If we consider the plane that passes through the vertical as well as our normal vector,

111
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,280
and then we consider all the different slices of our shape that are in that plane, or parallel to that plane,

112
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,040
then we can focus our attention on a two-dimensional variant of the problem.

113
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,180
If we just look at one of those slices, who has a normal vector, an angle theta away from the vertical,

114
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,780
its shadow might look something like this.

115
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,020
And if we draw a vertical line up to the left here, we have ourselves a right triangle.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,520
And from here we can do a little bit of angle chasing, where we follow around what that angle theta implies about the rest of the diagram.

117
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,360
And this means the lower right angle in this triangle is precisely theta.

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,180
So, when we want to understand the size of this shadow in comparison to the original size of the piece,

119
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,580
we can think about the cosine of that angle, theta, which remembers the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,180
It's literally the ratio between the size of the shadow and the size of the slice.

121
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,520
So, the factor by which the slice gets squished down in this direction is exactly cosine of theta.

122
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,180
And if we broaden our view to the entire square, all the slices in that direction get scaled by the same factor.

123
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,540
But in the other direction, in the one perpendicular to that slice, there is no stretching or squishing,

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,120
because the face is not at all tilted in that direction.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,700
So overall, the two-dimensional shadow of our two-dimensional face should also be scaled down by this factor of a cosine of theta.

126
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,340
It lines up with what you might intuitively guess, given the case where the angle is 0Â° and the case where it's 90Â°,

127
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,380
but it's reassuring to see why it's true.

128
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,800
And actually, as stated so far, this is not quite correct. There is a small problem with the formula that we've written.

129
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,240
In the case where theta is bigger than 90Â°, the cosine would actually come out to be negative.

130
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,400
But of course, we don't want to consider the shadow to have negative area, at least not in a problem like this.

131
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,340
So there's two different ways you could solve this. You could say we only ever want to consider the normal vector that is pointing up, that has a positive z component.

132
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,720
Or, more simply, we could say, just take the absolute value of that cosine, and that gives us a valid formula.

133
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,860
So Bob's happy because he has a precise formula describing the area of the shadow.

134
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,060
But Alice starts to think about it a little bit differently.

135
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,520
She says, okay, we've got some shape, and then we apply a rotation that sort of situates it into 3D space in some way,

136
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,660
and then we apply a flat projection that shoves that back into two-dimensional space.

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,340
And what stands out to her is that both of these are linear transformations.

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,420
That means that in principle you could describe each one of them with a matrix,

139
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,200
and that the overall transformation would look like the product of those two matrices.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,760
What Alice knows from one of her favorite subjects, linear algebra,

141
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,620
is that if you take some shape and you consider its area, then you apply some linear transformation,

142
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,320
then the area of that output looks like some constant times the original area of the shape.

143
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,960
More specifically, we have a name for that constant. It's called the determinant of the transformation.

144
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,660
If you're not so comfortable with linear algebra, we could give a much more intuitive description and say,

145
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,560
if you uniformly stretch the original shape in some direction, the output will also uniformly get stretched in some direction.

146
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,400
So the area of each of them should scale in proportion to each other.

147
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,320
Now, in principle, Alice could compute this determinant, but it's not really her style to do that, at least not to do so immediately.

148
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,760
Instead, the thing that she writes down is how this proportionality constant between our original shape and its shadow

149
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,100
does not depend on the original shape.

150
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,640
We could be talking about the shadow of this cat outline, or anything else, and the size of it doesn't really matter.

151
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,420
The only thing affecting that proportionality constant is what transformation we're applying,

152
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,140
which in this context means we could write it down as some factor that depends on the rotation being applied to the shape.

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,220
In the back of our mind, because of Bob's calculation, we know what that factor looks like.

154
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,500
You know, it's the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the normal vector and the vertical.

155
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,820
But Alice right now is just saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can think about that eventually when I want to.

156
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,480
But she knows we're about to average over all the different orientations anyway,

157
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,800
though she holds out some hope that any specific formula about a specific orientation might get washed away in that average.

158
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,640
Now it's easy to look at this and say, okay, well, Alice isn't really doing anything then.

159
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,440
Of course the area of the shadow is proportional to the area of the original shape.

160
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,640
They're both two-dimensional quantities. They should both scale like two-dimensional things.

161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,680
But keep in mind, this would not at all be true if we were dealing with the harder case that has a closer light source.

162
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,980
In that case, the projection is not linear.

163
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,880
For example, if I rotate this cat so that its tail ends up quite close to the light source,

164
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,160
then if I stretch the original shape uniformly in the x-direction, say by a factor of 1.5,

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,780
it might have a very disproportionate effect on the ultimate shadow

166
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,200
because the tail gets very disproportionately blown up as it gets really close to the light.

167
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,740
Again, Alice is keeping an eye out for what properties of the problem are actually relevant

168
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,440
because that helps her know how much she can generalize things.

169
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,260
Does the fact that we're thinking about a square face and not some other shape matter?

170
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,320
No, not really. Does the fact that the transformation is linear matter?

171
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,840
Yes, absolutely.

172
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Alice can also apply a similar way of thinking about the average shadow for any shape like this.

173
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,000
Say we have some sequence of rotations that we apply to our square face.

174
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,560
And let's call them R1, R2, R3, and so on.

175
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,420
Then the area of the shadow in each one of those cases looks like some factor times the area of the square.

176
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,300
And that factor depends on the rotation.

177
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,920
So if we take an empirical average for that shadow across the sample of rotations we're looking at right now,

178
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,320
the way it looks is to add up all of those shadow areas and then divide by the total number that we have.

179
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:46,460
Now, because of the linearity, this area of the original square can cleanly factor out of all of that, and it ends up on the left.

180
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,200
This isn't the exact average that we're looking for, it's just an empirical mean of a sample of rotations.

181
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,640
But in principle what we're looking for is what this approaches as the size of our sample approaches infinity.

182
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,040
And all the parts that depend on the size of the sample sit cleanly away from the area itself.

183
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,460
So whatever this approaches in the limit, it's just going to be some number.

184
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,540
It might be a royal pain to compute, we're not sure about that yet,

185
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,660
but the thing that Alice notes is that it's independent of the size and the shape of the particular 2D thing that we're looking at.

186
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a universal proportionality constant.

187
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,940
And her hope is that that universality somehow lends itself to a more elegant way to deduce what it must be.

188
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,720
Now Bob would be eager to compute this constant here and now, and in a few minutes I'll show you how he does it.

189
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,960
But before that I do want to stay in Alice's world for a little bit more, because this is where things start to really get fun.

190
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,780
In her desire to understand the overall structure of the question before diving into the details,

191
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:51,100
she's curious now about how the area of the shadow of the cube relates to the area of its individual faces.

192
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,760
Now if we can say something about the average area of a particular face,

193
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,400
does that tell us anything about the average area of the cube as a whole?

194
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,380
For example, a simple thing we could say is that that area is definitely less than the sum of the areas across all the faces,

195
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,920
because there's a meaningful amount of overlap between those shadows.

196
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,540
But it's not entirely clear how to think about that overlap,

197
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,380
because if we focus our attention just on two particular faces, in some orientations they don't overlap at all.

198
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,960
But in other orientations they do have some overlap,

199
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,280
and the specific shape and area of that overlap seems a little bit tricky to think about,

200
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,820
much less how on Earth we would average that across all of the different orientations.

201
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,460
But Alice has about three clever insights through this whole problem, and this is the first one of them.

202
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,300
She says, actually, if we think about the whole cube, not just a pair of faces,

203
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:48,180
we can conclude that the area of the shadow for a given orientation is exactly one half the sum of the areas of all of the faces.

204
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,460
Intuitively you can maybe guess that half of them are bathed in the light and half of them are not,

205
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,660
but here's the way that she justifies it.

206
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,400
She says for a particular ray of light that would go from the sky and eventually hit a point in the shadow,

207
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,860
that ray passes through the cube at exactly two points.

208
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
There's one moment when it enters and one moment when it exits.

209
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,780
So every point in that shadow corresponds to exactly two faces above it.

210
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,220
Well, okay, that's not exactly true if that beam of light happened to go through the edge of one of the squares.

211
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
There's a little bit of ambiguity on how many faces it's passing.

212
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,340
But those account for zero area inside the shadow,

213
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,040
so we're safe to ignore them if the thing we're trying to do is compute the area.

214
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,040
If Alice is pressed and she needs to justify why exactly this is true,

215
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,080
which is important for understanding how the problem might generalize,

216
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,820
she can appeal to the idea of convexity.

217
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,440
Convexity is one of those properties where a lot of us have an intuitive sense for what it should mean,

218
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,580
you know, it's shapes that just bulge out, they never dent inward.

219
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,020
But mathematicians have a pretty clever way of formalizing it that's helpful for actual proofs.

220
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,880
They say that a set is convex if the line that connects any two points inside that set

221
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,660
is entirely contained within the set itself.

222
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,380
So, a square is convex because no matter where you put two points inside that square,

223
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,660
the line connecting them is entirely contained inside the square.

224
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,720
But something like the symbol pi is not convex,

225
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,320
I can easily find two different points so that the line connecting them has to peak outside of the set itself.

226
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,600
None of the letters in the word convex are themselves convex.

227
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,020
You can find two points so that the line connecting them has to pass outside of the set.

228
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,420
It's a really clever way to formalize this idea of a shape that only bulges out.

229
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,540
Because anytime that it dents inward, you can find these counterexample lines.

230
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,000
Or, our cube, because it's convex, between the first point of entry and the last point of exit,

231
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,180
it has to stay entirely inside the cube by definition of convexity.

232
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,000
But if we were dealing with some other non-convex shape, like a donut,

233
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,080
you could find a ray of light that enters, then exits, then enters, then exits again,

234
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,160
so you wouldn't have a clean two-to-one cover from the shadows.

235
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,420
The shadows of all of its different parts, if you were to cover this in a bunch of faces,

236
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,080
would not be precisely two times the area of the shadow itself.

237
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,260
So, that's the first key insight, the face shadows double cover the cube shadow.

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,660
And the next one is a little bit more symbolic, so let's start things off by abbreviating our notation a little to make room on the screen.

239
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,680
Instead of writing the area of the shadow of the cube, I'm just going to write s of the cube.

240
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,240
And similarly, instead of the area of the shadow of a particular face, I'm just going to write s of f,

241
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,420
where that subscript j indicates which face I'm talking about.

242
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,620
But of course, we should really be talking about the shadow of a particular rotation applied to the cube.

243
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,280
So I might write this as s of some rotation applied to the cube,

244
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,260
and likewise on the right, it's the area of the shadow of that same rotation applied to a given one of the faces.

245
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,480
With the more compact notation at hand, let's think about the average of this shadow area across many different rotations,

246
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,700
some sample of r1, r2, r3, and so on.

247
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,220
Again, that average just involves adding up all of those shadow areas and then dividing them by n.

248
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,280
And in principle, if we were to look at this for larger and larger samples, let n approach infinity,

249
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,360
that would give us the average area of the shadow of the cube.

250
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,000
Some of you might be thinking, yes, we know this, you've said this already,

251
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,640
but it's beneficial to write it out so that we can understand why it is that expressing the shadow area for a particular rotation of the cube

252
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,780
as a sum across all of its faces, or one half times that sum at least,

253
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,760
why is that beneficial? What is it going to do for us?

254
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,440
Well, let's just write it out, where for each one of these rotations of the cube,

255
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,900
we could break down that shadow as a sum across that same rotation applied across all of the faces.

256
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,880
And when it's written as a grid like this, we can get to Alice's second insight,

257
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,720
which is to shift the way that we're thinking about the sum from going row by row to instead going column by column.

258
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,920
For example, if we focused our attention just on the first column,

259
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,080
what it's telling us is to add up the area of the shadow of the first face across many different orientations.

260
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,760
So if we were to take that sum and divide it by the size of our sample,

261
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,940
that gives us an empirical average for the area of the shadow of this face.

262
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,960
So if we take larger and larger samples, letting that size go to infinity,

263
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,240
this will approach the average shadow area for a square.

264
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,820
Likewise, the second column can be thought of as telling us the average area for the second face of the cube,

265
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,780
which should of course be the same number.

266
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,360
And same deal for any other column, it's telling us the average area for a particular face.

267
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,040
So that gives us a very different way of thinking about our whole expression.

268
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,080
Instead of saying add up the areas of the cubes at all the different orientations,

269
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,560
we could say just add up the average shadows for the six different faces and divide the total by one half.

270
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,920
The term on the left here is thinking about adding up rows first,

271
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,760
and the term on the right is thinking about adding up columns first.

272
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:51,140
In short, the average of the sum of the face shadows is the same as the sum of the average of the face shadows.

273
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,960
Maybe that swap seems simple, maybe it doesn't,

274
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,320
but I can tell you that there is actually a little bit more than meets the eye to the step that we just took,

275
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,700
but we'll get to that later.

276
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,680
And remember, we know that the average area for a particular face

277
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,220
looks like some universal proportionality constant times the area of that face.

278
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,080
So if we're adding this up across all the faces of the cube,

279
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,200
we could think of this as equaling some constant times the surface area of the cube.

280
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,760
And that's pretty interesting.

281
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,480
The average area for the shadow of this cube is going to be proportional to its surface area.

282
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,500
But at the same time, you might complain,

283
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,060
well Alice is just pushing around a bunch of symbols here,

284
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,080
because none of this matters if we don't know what that proportionality constant is.

285
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,380
I mean, it almost seems obvious.

286
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,620
Like, of course the average shadow area should be proportional to the surface area.

287
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,260
They're both two-dimensional quantities,

288
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,260
so they should scale in lockstep with each other.

289
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,380
I mean, it's not obvious.

290
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
After all, for a closer light source, it simply wouldn't be true.

291
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,960
And also, this business where we added up the grid column by column versus row by row

292
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,700
is a little more nuanced than it might look at first.

293
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,980
There's a subtle, hidden assumption underlying all of this,

294
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,420
which carries a special significance when we choose to revisit the question

295
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,300
of what probability distribution is being taken across the space of all orientations.

296
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,080
But more than anything, the reason that it's not obvious

297
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,580
is that the significance of this result right here

298
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,360
is not merely that these two values are proportional.

299
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,520
It's that an analogous fact will hold true for any convex solids,

300
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
and, crucially, the actual content of what Alice has built up so far

301
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,920
is that it'll be the same proportionality constant across all of them.

302
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,620
Now if you really mull over that, some of you may be able to predict

303
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,180
the way that Alice is able to finish things off from here.

304
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,940
It's really delightful, it's honestly my main reason for covering this topic.

305
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,060
But before we get into it, I think it's easy to underappreciate her result

306
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,140
unless we dig into the details of what it is that she manages to avoid.

307
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,680
So let's take a moment to turn our attention back into Bob's world,

308
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,200
because while Alice has been doing all of this,

309
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,400
he's been busy doing some computations.

310
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,300
In fact, what he's been working on is finding exactly what Alice has yet to figure out,

311
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,360
which is how to take the formula that he found for the area of a square's shadow

312
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,400
and taking the natural next step of trying to find the average of that square's shadow

313
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,980
averaged over all possible orientations.

314
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,720
So the way Bob starts, if he's thinking about all the different possible orientations for this square,

315
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,160
is to ask, what are all the different normal vectors that that square can have in all these orientations,

316
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,240
because everything about its shadow comes down to that normal vector.

317
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,320
It's not too hard to see that all those possible normal vectors trace out the surface of a sphere,

318
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,560
if we assume it's a unit normal vector, it's a sphere with radius 1.

319
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,580
And furthermore, Bob figures that each point of this sphere should be just as likely to occur as any other.

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,320
Our probabilities should be uniform in that way, there's no reason to prefer one direction over another.

321
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,120
But in the context of continuous probabilities, it's not very helpful to talk about the likelihood of a particular individual point,

322
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,440
because in the uncountable infinity of points on the sphere, that would be zero and unhelpful.

323
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,560
So instead, the more precise way to phrase this uniformity would be to say the probability that our normal vector

324
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,440
lands in any given patch of area on the sphere should be proportional to that area itself.

325
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,120
More specifically, it should equal the area of that little patch divided by the total surface area of the sphere.

326
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,060
If that's true, no matter what patch of area we're considering, that's what we mean by a uniform distribution on the sphere.

327
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,260
Now to be clear, points on the sphere are not the same thing as orientations in 3D space,

328
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,700
because even if you know what normal vector this square is going to have, that leaves us with another degree of freedom,

329
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,160
the square could be rotated about that normal vector.

330
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,720
But Bob doesn't actually have to care about that extra degree of freedom, because in all of those cases,

331
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,460
the area of the shadow is the same, it's only dependent on the cosine of the angle between that normal vector and the vertical.

332
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:53,540
Which is kind of neat, all those shadows are genuinely different shapes, they're not the same, but the area of each of them will be the same.

333
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,500
What this means is that when Bob wants this average shadow area over all possible orientations,

334
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,460
all he really needs to know is the average value of this absolute value of cosine of theta for all different possible normal vectors,

335
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,440
all different possible points on the sphere.

336
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,320
So, how do you compute an average like this?

337
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,580
Well, if we lived in some kind of discrete pixelated world, where there's only a finite number of possible angles theta that that normal vector could have,

338
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,440
the average would be pretty straightforward.

339
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,580
What you do is find the probability of landing on any particular value of theta,

340
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,560
which will tell us something like how much of the sphere do normal vectors with that angle make up,

341
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,940
and then you multiply it by the thing we want to take the average of, this formula for the area of the shadow.

342
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:44,020
And then you would add that up over all of the different possible values of theta, ranging from 0 up to 180 degrees, or pi radians.

343
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,380
But of course, in reality, there is a continuum of possible values of theta, this uncountable infinity,

344
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,980
and the probability of landing on any specific particular value of theta will actually be 0.

345
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,880
And so a sum like this unfortunately doesn't really make any sense,

346
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,160
or if it does make sense, adding up infinitely many zeros should just give us a 0.

347
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,880
The short answer for what we do instead is that we compute an integral.

348
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,260
And I'll level with you, the hard part here is I'm not entirely sure what background I should be assuming from those of you watching right now.

349
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,800
Maybe it's the case that you're quite comfortable with calculus and you don't need me to belabor the point here.

350
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,780
Maybe it's the case that you're not familiar with calculus and I shouldn't just be throwing down integrals like that.

351
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,440
Or maybe you, you know, you took a calculus class a while ago, but you need a little bit of a refresher.

352
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,140
I'm going to go with the option of setting this up as if it's a calculus lesson,

353
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,520
because to be honest, even when you are quite comfortable with integrals, setting them up can be kind of an error-prone process,

354
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,040
and calling back to the underlying definition is a good way to sort of check yourself in the process.

355
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,940
If we lived in a time before calculus existed and integrals weren't a thing, and we wanted to approximate an answer to this question,

356
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,520
one way we could go about it is to take a sample of values for theta that ranges from 0 up to 180 degrees.

357
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,040
We might think of them as evenly spaced with some sort of difference between each one, some delta theta.

358
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:09,240
And it's still the case that it would be unhelpful to ask about the probability of a particular value of theta occurring, even if it's 1 in our sample.

359
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,360
That probability would still be 0 and it would be unhelpful.

360
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,920
But what is helpful to ask is the probability of falling between two different values from our sample,

361
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,020
in this little band of latitude with a width of delta theta.

362
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,560
Based on our assumption that the distribution along this sphere should be uniform, that probability comes down to knowing the area of this band.

363
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,720
More specifically, the chances that a randomly chosen vector lands in that band should be that area divided by the total surface area of the sphere.

364
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:45,280
To figure out that area, let's first think of the radius of that band, which, if the radius of our sphere is 1, is definitely going to be smaller than 1.

365
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:54,780
And in fact, if we draw the appropriate little right triangle here, you can see that that little radius, let's just say at the top of the band, should be the sine of our angle, the sine of theta.

366
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,020
This means that the circumference of the band should be 2 pi times the sine of that angle,

367
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,520
and then the area of the band should be that circumference times its thickness, that little delta theta.

368
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Or rather, the area of our band is approximately this quantity.

369
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:16,320
What's important is that for a finer sample of many more values of theta, the accuracy of that approximation would get better and better.

370
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,040
Now remember, the reason we wanted this area is to know the probability of falling into that band,

371
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:28,080
which is this area divided by the surface area of the sphere, which we know to be 4 pi times its radius squared.

372
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,860
That's a value that you could also compute with an integral similar to the one that we're setting up now,

373
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,080
but for now we can take it as a given, as a standard well-known formula.

374
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,880
And this probability itself is just a stepping stone in the direction of what we actually want,

375
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,320
which is the average area for the shadow of a square.

376
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,580
To get that, we'll multiply this probability times the corresponding shadow area,

377
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,020
which is this absolute value of cosine theta expression we've seen many times up to this point.

378
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,340
And our estimate for this average would now come down to adding up this expression across all of the different bands,

379
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,700
all of the different samples of theta that we've taken.

380
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,360
This right here, by the way, is when Bob is just totally in his element.

381
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,860
We've got a lot of exact formulas describing something very concrete, actually digging in on our way to a real answer.

382
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,460
And again, if it feels like a lot of detail, I want you to appreciate that fact,

383
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,920
so that you can appreciate just how magical it is when Alice manages to somehow avoid all of this.

384
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
Anyway, looking back at our expression, let's clean things up a little bit,

385
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,000
like factoring out all of the terms that don't depend on theta itself.

386
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,480
And we can simplify that 2 pi divided by 4 pi to simply be 1 half.

387
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,460
And to make it a little more analogous to calculus, with integrals, let me just swap the main terms inside the sum here.

388
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,040
What we now have, this sum that's going to approximate the answer to our question, is almost what an integral is.

389
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,980
Instead of writing the sigma for sum, we write the integral symbol, this kind of elongated Leibnizian s,

390
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,980
showing us that we're going from 0 to pi.

391
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
And instead of describing the step size as delta theta, a concrete finite amount,

392
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,160
we instead describe it as d theta, which I like to think of as signaling the fact that some kind of limit is being taken.

393
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:13,580
What that integral means, by definition, is whatever the sum on the bottom approaches for finer and finer subdivisions.

394
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,100
More dense samples that we might take for theta itself.

395
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,440
And at this point, for those of you who do know calculus, I'll just write down the details of how you would actually carry this out,

396
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,620
as you might see it written down in Bob's notebook.

397
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,160
It's the usual anti-derivative stuff, but the one key step is to bring in a certain trig identity.

398
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:43,520
In the end, what Bob finds after doing this is the surprisingly clean fact that the average area for a square's shadow is precisely one half the area of that square.

399
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,560
This is the mystery constant, which Alice doesn't yet know.

400
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,780
If Bob were to look over her shoulder and see the work that she's done, he could finish out the problem right now.

401
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,160
He plugs in the constant that he just found, and he knows the final answer.

402
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:06,200
And now, finally, with all of this as backdrop, what is it that Alice does to carry out the final solution?

403
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,260
I introduced her as someone who really likes to generalize the results she finds.

404
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,680
And usually those generalizations end up as interesting footnotes that aren't really material for solving particular problems.

405
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,760
But this is a case where the generalization itself draws her to a quantitative result.

406
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:31,680
Remember, the substance of what she's found so far is that if you look at any convex solid, then the average area for its shadow is going to be proportional to its surface area.

407
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,500
And critically, it'll be the same proportionality constant across all of these solids.

408
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:44,460
So all Alice needs to do is find just a single convex solid out there where she already knows the average area of its shadow.

409
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,840
And some of you may see where this is going.

410
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,060
The most symmetric solid available to us is a sphere.

411
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:58,020
No matter what the orientation of that sphere, its shadow, the flat projection shadow, is always a circle with an area of pi r squared.

412
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,040
So in particular, that's its average shadow area.

413
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,320
And the surface area of a sphere, like I mentioned before, is exactly 4 pi r squared.

414
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:16,340
By the way, I did make a video talking all about that surface area formula and how Archimedes proved it thousands of years before calculus existed, so you don't need integrals to find it.

415
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:24,800
The magic of what Alice has done is that she can take this seemingly specific fact that the shadow of a sphere has an area exactly 1 fourth its surface area

416
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:33,580
and use it to conclude a much more general fact that for any convex solid out there, its shadow and surface area are related in the same way, in a certain sense.

417
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:43,620
So with that, she can go and fill in the details of the particular question about a cube and say that its average shadow area will be 1 fourth times its surface area, 6 s squared.

418
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:50,800
But the much more memorable fact that you'll go to sleep thinking about is how it didn't really matter that we were talking about a cube at all.

419
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:59,380
Now, that's all very pretty, but some of you might complain that this isn't really a valid argument because spheres don't have flat faces.

420
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:08,940
When I said Alice's argument generalizes to any convex solid, if we actually look at the argument itself, it definitely depends on the use of a finite number of flat faces.

421
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:20,440
For example, if we were mapping it to a dodecahedron, you would start by saying that the area of a particular shadow of that dodecahedron looks like exactly 1 half times the sum of the areas of the shadows of all its faces.

422
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,440
Once again, you could use a certain ray of light mixed with convexity argument to draw that conclusion.

423
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:35,720
And remember, the benefit of expressing that shadow area as a sum is that when we want to average over a bunch of different rotations, we can describe that sum as a big grid

424
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,820
where we can then go column by column and consider the average area for the shadow of each face.

425
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:52,720
And also, a critical fact was the conclusion from much earlier that the average shadow for any 2D object, a flat 2D object, which is important, will equal some universal proportionality constant times its area.

426
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:00,840
The significance was that that constant didn't depend on the shape itself. It could have been a square, or a cat, or the pentagonal faces of our dodecahedron, whatever.

427
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:08,260
Though, after hastily carrying this over to a sphere that doesn't have a finite number of flat faces, you would be right to complain.

428
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,240
But luckily, it's a pretty easy detail to fill in.

429
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:21,160
What you can do is imagine a sequence of different polyhedra that successively approximate a sphere, in the sense that their faces hug tighter and tighter around the genuine surface of the sphere.

430
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:30,780
For each one of those approximations, we can draw the same conclusion, that its average shadow is going to be proportional to its surface area with this universal proportionality constant.

431
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,540
So then, if we say, okay, let's take the limit of the ratio between the average shadow area at each step and the surface area at each step,

432
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,620
well, since that ratio is never changing, it's always equal to this constant, then in the limit, it's also going to equal that constant.

433
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:52,080
But on the other hand, by their definition, in the limit, their average shadow area should be that of a circle, which is ÏrÂ²,

434
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,980
and the limit of the surface areas would be the surface area of the sphere, 4ÏrÂ².

435
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:07,000
So we do genuinely get the conclusion that intuition would suggest, but, as is so common with Alice's argument here, we do have to be a little delicate in how we justify that intuition.

436
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:19,860
It's easy for this contrast of Alice and Bob to come across like a value judgment, as if I'm saying, look how clever Alice has managed to be,

437
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,560
she insightfully avoided all those computations that Bob had to do.

438
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,900
But that would be a very, um, misguided conclusion.

439
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,080
I think there's an important way that popularizations of math differ from the feeling of actually doing math.

440
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,780
There's this bias towards showing the slick proofs, the arguments with some clever keen insight that lets you avoid doing calculations.

441
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,980
I could just be projecting, since I'm very guilty of this, but what I can tell you, sitting on the other side of the screen here,

442
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:52,300
is that it feels a lot more attractive to make a video about Alice's approach than Bob's.

443
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,120
For one thing, in Alice's approach, the line of reasoning is fun, it has these nice aha moments.

444
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,900
But also, crucially, the way that you explain it is more or less the same for a very wide range of mathematical backgrounds.

445
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,080
It's much less enticing to do a video about Bob's approach, not because the computations are all that bad, I mean, they're honestly not,

446
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,860
but the pragmatic reality is that the appropriate pace to explain it looks very different depending on the different mathematical backgrounds in the audience.

447
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,620
So you, watching this right now, clearly consume math videos online, and I think in doing so it's worth being aware of this bias.

448
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:34,520
If the aim is to have a genuine lesson on problem solving, too much focus on the slick proofs runs the risk of being disingenuous.

449
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,020
For example, let's say we were to step up to challenge mode here and ask about the case with a closer light source.

450
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:48,160
To my knowledge, there is not a similarly slick solution to Alice's here, where you can just relate to a single shape like a sphere.

451
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,300
The much more productive warmup to have done would have been the calculus of Bob's approach.

452
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:04,480
And if you look at the history of this problem, it was proved by Cauchy in 1832, and if we paw through his handwritten notes, they look a lot more similar to Bob's work than Alice's work.

453
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,400
Right here at the top of page 11, you can see what is essentially the same integral that you and I set up in the middle.

454
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,240
On the other hand, the whole framing of the paper is to find a general fact, not something specific like the case of a cube.

455
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:26,400
So if we were asking the question which of these two mindsets correlates with the act of discovering new math, the right answer would almost certainly have to be a blend of both.

456
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:34,180
But I would suggest that many people don't sign enough weight to the part of that blend where you're eager to dive into calculations.

457
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
And I think there's some risk that the videos I make might contribute to that.

458
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:47,840
In the podcast I did with the mathematician Alex Kontorovich, he talked about the often underappreciated importance of just drilling on computations to build intuition,

459
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,320
whether you're a student engaging with a new class, or a practicing research mathematician engaging with a new field of study.

460
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,040
A listener actually wrote in to highlight what an impression that particular section made.

461
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:07,640
They're a PhD student and describe themselves as being worried that their mathematical abilities were starting to fade, which they attributed to becoming older and less sharp.

462
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:16,320
But hearing a practicing mathematician talk about the importance of doing hundreds of concrete examples in order to learn something new, evidently that changed their perspective.

463
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,160
In their own words, recognizing this completely reshaped their outlook and their results.

464
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:30,580
And if you look at the famous mathematicians through history, you know, Newton, Euler, Gauss, all of them, they all have this seemingly infinite patience for doing tedious calculations.

465
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:42,720
The irony of being biased to show insights that let us avoid calculations is that the way people often train up the intuitions to find those insights in the first place is by doing piles and piles of calculations.

466
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,420
All that said, something would definitely be missing without the Alice mindset here.

467
00:37:49,980 --> 00:38:00,320
I mean, think about it, how sad would it be if we solved this problem for a cube and we never stepped outside of the trees to see the forest and understand that this is a super general fact, it applies to a huge family of shapes.

468
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:14,820
And if you consider that math is not just about answering the questions that are posed to you, but about introducing new ideas and constructs, one fun side note about Alice's approach here is that it suggests a fun way to quantify the idea of convexity.

469
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:26,680
Rather than just having a yes-no answer, is it convex, is it not, we could put a number to it by saying, consider the average area of the shadow of some solid, multiply that by four, divide it by the surface area,

470
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:36,460
and if that number is one, you've got a convex solid, but if it's less than one, it's non-convex, and how close it is to one tells you how close it is to being convex.

471
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:48,360
Also, one of the nice things about the Alice solution here is that it helps explain why it is that mathematicians have what can sometimes look like a bizarre infatuation with generality and with abstraction.

472
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:57,360
The more examples that you see where generalizing and abstracting actually helps you to solve a specific case, the more you start to adopt the same infatuation.

473
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:07,000
And as a final thought for the stalwart viewers among you who've stuck through it this far, there is still one unanswered question about the very premise of our puzzle.

474
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,940
What exactly does it mean to choose a random orientation?

475
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:20,780
Now if that feels like a silly question, like of course we know what it should mean, I would encourage you to watch a video that I just did with Numberphile on a conundrum from probability known as Bertrand's paradox.

476
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:30,420
After you watch it, and if you appreciate some of the nuance at play here, homework for you is to reflect on where exactly Alice and Bob implicitly answered this question.

477
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:41,700
The case with Bob is relatively straightforward, but the point at which Alice locks down some specific distribution on the space of all orientations is not at all obvious. It's actually very subtle.

478
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,320
