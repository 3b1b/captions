1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
In a moment I'm going to tell you about a certain 

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,300
really nice puzzle involving the shadow of a cube.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,306
But before we get to that, I should say that the point of this video is 

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:11,566
not exactly the puzzle per se, it's about two distinct problem-solving 

5
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:15,240
styles that are reflected in two different ways that we can tackle this problem.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,030
In fact, let's anthropomorphize those two different styles by imagining two students, 

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,700
Alice and Bob, that embody each one of the approaches.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,980
So Bob will be the kind of student who really loves calculation.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,703
As soon as there's a moment when he can dig into the details and get a very concrete 

10
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:34,340
view of the concrete situation in front of him, that's where he's the most pleased.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,894
Alice on the other hand is more inclined to procrastinate the computations, 

12
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:42,420
not because she doesn't know how to do them or doesn't want to per se, 

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,443
but she prefers to get a nice high-level general overview of the kind of problem 

14
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:50,168
she's dealing with, the general shape that it has before she digs into the 

15
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:51,360
computations themselves.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,891
She's most pleased if she understands not just the specific question sitting 

17
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,864
in front of her, but also the broadest possible way that you could generalize it, 

18
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:03,450
and especially if the more general view can lend itself to more swift and 

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,940
elegant computations, once she does actually sit down to carry them out.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,998
Now the puzzle that both of them are going to be faced 

21
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:19,140
with is to find the average area for the shadow of a cube.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,657
So if I have a cube kind of sitting here hovering in space, 

23
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:25,460
there are a few things that influence the area of its shadow.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,260
One obvious one would be the size of the cube, smaller cube, smaller shadow.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,298
But also if it's sitting at different orientations, 

26
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:36,160
those orientations correspond to different particular shadows with different areas.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,839
And when I say find the average here, what I mean is average 

28
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:43,100
over all possible orientations for a particular size of the cube.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,100
The astute among you might point out that it also matters a lot where the light source is.

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,211
If the light source were very low, close to the cube itself, 

31
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,660
then the shadow ends up larger.

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,866
And if the light source were kind of positioned laterally off to the side, 

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,560
this can distort the shadow and give it a very different shape.

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,604
Accounting for that light position stands to be highly interesting in its own right, 

35
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:06,825
but the puzzle is hard enough as it is, so at least initially, 

36
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:11,323
let's do the easiest thing we can and say that the light is directly above the cube and 

37
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:15,668
really far away, effectively infinitely far, so that all we're considering is a flat 

38
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,808
projection, in the sense that if you look at any coordinates, x, y, z, in space, 

39
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,700
the flat projection would be x, y, 0.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,811
So, just to get our bearings, the easiest situation to think about would 

41
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,280
be if the cube is straight up, with two of its faces parallel to the ground.

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,285
In that case, this flat projection shadow is simply a square, 

43
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:37,900
and if we say the side lengths of the cube are s, then the area of that shadow is sÂ².

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,712
And by the way, any time that I have a label up on these animations, 

45
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:45,460
like the one down here, I'll be assuming that the relevant cube has a side length of 1.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,663
Now, another special case among all the orientations that's fun to think 

47
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:53,040
about is if the long diagonal is parallel to the direction of the light.

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,643
In that case, the shadow actually looks like a regular hexagon, 

49
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,161
and if you use some of the methods that we will develop in a few minutes, 

50
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:04,108
you can compute that the area of that shadow is exactly the square root of 3 times 

51
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,820
the area of one of the square faces.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,100
But of course, more often, the actual shadow will 

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,200
be not so regular as a square or a hexagon.

54
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,836
It's some harder to think about shape, based on 

55
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,240
some harder to think about orientation for this cube.

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,776
Earlier, I casually threw out this phrase of averaging over all possible orientations, 

57
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:25,300
but you could rightly ask, what exactly is that supposed to mean?

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,630
I think a lot of us have an intuitive feel for what we want it to mean, 

59
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,860
at least in the sense of what experiment would you do to verify it.

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,390
You might imagine tossing this cube in the air, like a die, 

61
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,385
freezing it at some arbitrary point, recording the area of the shadow from that position, 

62
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:42,440
and then repeating.

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,380
If you do this many many times, over and over, you can take the mean of your sample.

64
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,177
The number that we want to get at, the true average here, 

65
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:56,512
should be whatever that experimental mean approaches as you do more and more tosses, 

66
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,940
approaching infinitely many.

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,005
Even still, the sticklers among you could complain that doesn't really answer 

68
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:07,800
the question, because it leaves open the issue of how we're defining a random toss.

69
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,496
The proper way to answer this, if we want it to be more formal, 

70
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:14,842
would be to first describe the space of all possible orientations, 

71
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:17,540
which mathematicians have actually given a fancy name.

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,440
They call it SO3, typically defined in terms of a certain family of 3x3 matrices.

73
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,118
And the question we want to answer is, what probability 

74
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,760
distribution are we putting to this entire space?

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,105
It's only when such a probability distribution is well-defined, 

76
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,500
that we can answer a question involving an average.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,332
If you are a stickler for that kind of thing, I want you 

78
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,820
to hold off on that question until the end of the video.

79
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,993
You'll be surprised at how far we can get with the more heuristic, 

80
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:47,815
experimental idea of just repeating a bunch of random tosses without really defining 

81
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:48,580
the distribution.

82
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,831
Once we see Alice and Bob's solutions, it's actually very interesting to 

83
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:56,480
ask how exactly each one of them defined this distribution along their way.

84
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,458
And remember, this is not meant to be a lesson about cube shadows per se, 

85
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,565
but a lesson about problem solving, told through the lens of two 

86
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,100
different mindsets that we might bring to the puzzle.

87
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,744
And as with any lesson on problem solving, the goal here is not to get to the answer 

88
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,720
as quickly as we can, but hopefully for you to feel like you found the answer yourself.

89
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,546
So if ever there's a point when you feel like you might have an idea, 

90
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,820
give yourself the freedom to pause and try to think it through.

91
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,963
As a first step, and this is really independent of any particular problem solving style, 

92
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,894
just any time you find a hard question, a good thing that you can do is ask, 

93
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:38,233
what's the simplest possible, non-trivial variant of the problem that you can try to 

94
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:38,540
solve?

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,824
So in our case, what you might say is, okay, let's 

96
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:44,000
forget about averaging over all the orientations.

97
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,420
That's a tricky thing to think about.

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,373
And let's even forget about all the different faces of the cube, 

99
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:50,860
because they overlap, and that's also tricky to think about.

100
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,753
Just for one particular face, and one particular orientation, 

101
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:56,900
can we compute the area of this shadow?

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,787
Once more, if you want to get your bearings with some special cases, 

103
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,371
the easiest is when that face is parallel to the ground, 

104
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:06,680
in which case the area of the shadow is the same as the area of the face.

105
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,215
And on the other hand, if we were to tilt that face 90 degrees, 

106
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:13,440
then its shadow will be a straight line, and it has an area of zero.

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,420
So Bob looks at this, and he wants an actual formula for that shadow.

108
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,347
And the way he might think about it is to consider 

109
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,700
the normal vector perpendicular off of that face.

110
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,820
And what seems relevant is the angle that that normal vector makes with the vertical, 

111
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,080
with the direction where the light is coming from, which we might call theta.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,668
Now, from the two special cases we just looked at, 

113
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:37,009
we know that when theta is equal to zero, the area of that shadow is 

114
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,301
the same as the area of the shape itself, which is s squared if the 

115
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,560
square has side lengths s.

116
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,800
And if theta is equal to 90 degrees, then the area of that shadow is zero.

117
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,868
And it's probably not too hard to guess that trigonometry will be somehow relevant, 

118
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,589
so anyone comfortable with their trig functions could probably 

119
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,620
hazard a guess as to what the right formula is.

120
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,120
But Bob is more detail-oriented than that.

121
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,667
He wants to properly prove what that area should be, 

122
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,020
rather than just making a guess based on the endpoints.

123
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,740
And the way you might think about it could be something like this.

124
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,495
If we consider the plane that passes through the vertical as well as our normal vector, 

125
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,754
and then we consider all the different slices of our shape that are in that plane, 

126
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:17,038
or parallel to that plane, then we can focus our attention on a 

127
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,040
two-dimensional variant of the problem.

128
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,641
If we just look at one of those slices, who has a normal vector, 

129
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,780
an angle theta away from the vertical, its shadow might look something like this.

130
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,020
And if we draw a vertical line up to the left here, we have ourselves a right triangle.

131
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,959
And from here we can do a little bit of angle chasing, 

132
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,520
where we follow around what that angle theta implies about the rest of the diagram.

133
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,360
And this means the lower right angle in this triangle is precisely theta.

134
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,216
So, when we want to understand the size of this shadow in comparison 

135
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:51,547
to the original size of the piece, we can think about the cosine of that angle, 

136
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:54,580
theta, which remembers the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

137
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,180
It's literally the ratio between the size of the shadow and the size of the slice.

138
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,652
So, the factor by which the slice gets squished 

139
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:04,520
down in this direction is exactly cosine of theta.

140
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,345
And if we broaden our view to the entire square, 

141
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,180
all the slices in that direction get scaled by the same factor.

142
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,649
But in the other direction, in the one perpendicular to that slice, 

143
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,398
there is no stretching or squishing, because the face is not at all tilted in 

144
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:18,120
that direction.

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,026
So overall, the two-dimensional shadow of our two-dimensional face 

146
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:25,700
should also be scaled down by this factor of a cosine of theta.

147
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,558
It lines up with what you might intuitively guess, 

148
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,532
given the case where the angle is 0Â° and the case where it's 90Â°, 

149
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:33,380
but it's reassuring to see why it's true.

150
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,320
And actually, as stated so far, this is not quite correct.

151
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,799
There is a small problem with the formula that we've written.

152
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,842
In the case where theta is bigger than 90Â°, the 

153
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:46,240
cosine would actually come out to be negative.

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,726
But of course, we don't want to consider the shadow to have negative area, 

155
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,400
at least not in a problem like this.

156
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,300
So there's two different ways you could solve this.

157
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,959
You could say we only ever want to consider the normal vector that is pointing up, 

158
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,340
that has a positive z component.

159
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,902
Or, more simply, we could say, just take the absolute value of that cosine, 

160
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:04,720
and that gives us a valid formula.

161
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,860
So Bob's happy because he has a precise formula describing the area of the shadow.

162
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,060
But Alice starts to think about it a little bit differently.

163
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,541
She says, okay, we've got some shape, and then we apply a rotation 

164
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,243
that sort of situates it into 3D space in some way, 

165
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:24,660
and then we apply a flat projection that shoves that back into two-dimensional space.

166
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,340
And what stands out to her is that both of these are linear transformations.

167
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,500
That means that in principle you could describe each one of them with a matrix, 

168
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,200
and that the overall transformation would look like the product of those two matrices.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,483
What Alice knows from one of her favorite subjects, linear algebra, 

170
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:43,455
is that if you take some shape and you consider its area, 

171
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:47,963
then you apply some linear transformation, then the area of that output looks like some 

172
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,320
constant times the original area of the shape.

173
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,780
More specifically, we have a name for that constant.

174
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,960
It's called the determinant of the transformation.

175
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,684
If you're not so comfortable with linear algebra, 

176
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:01,449
we could give a much more intuitive description and say, 

177
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:04,504
if you uniformly stretch the original shape in some direction, 

178
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,560
the output will also uniformly get stretched in some direction.

179
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,400
So the area of each of them should scale in proportion to each other.

180
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
Now, in principle, Alice could compute this determinant, 

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,320
but it's not really her style to do that, at least not to do so immediately.

182
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,911
Instead, the thing that she writes down is how this proportionality constant 

183
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:27,100
between our original shape and its shadow does not depend on the original shape.

184
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,927
We could be talking about the shadow of this cat outline, 

185
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,640
or anything else, and the size of it doesn't really matter.

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,431
The only thing affecting that proportionality constant is what transformation 

187
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:39,834
we're applying, which in this context means we could write it down as 

188
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,140
some factor that depends on the rotation being applied to the shape.

189
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,748
In the back of our mind, because of Bob's calculation, 

190
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:48,220
we know what that factor looks like.

191
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,390
You know, it's the absolute value of the cosine of 

192
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,500
the angle between the normal vector and the vertical.

193
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,865
But Alice right now is just saying, yeah, yeah, 

194
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:56,820
yeah, I can think about that eventually when I want to.

195
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,896
But she knows we're about to average over all the different orientations anyway, 

196
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:03,991
though she holds out some hope that any specific formula about a 

197
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,800
specific orientation might get washed away in that average.

198
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,640
Now it's easy to look at this and say, okay, well, Alice isn't really doing anything then.

199
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,440
Of course the area of the shadow is proportional to the area of the original shape.

200
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,280
They're both two-dimensional quantities.

201
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,640
They should both scale like two-dimensional things.

202
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,916
But keep in mind, this would not at all be true if we were 

203
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,680
dealing with the harder case that has a closer light source.

204
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,980
In that case, the projection is not linear.

205
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,442
For example, if I rotate this cat so that its tail ends up quite close to the light 

206
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,426
source, then if I stretch the original shape uniformly in the x-direction, 

207
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:40,941
say by a factor of 1.5, it might have a very disproportionate effect on the ultimate 

208
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:45,509
shadow because the tail gets very disproportionately blown up as it gets really close 

209
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,200
to the light.

210
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,011
Again, Alice is keeping an eye out for what properties of the problem are 

211
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:53,440
actually relevant because that helps her know how much she can generalize things.

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,260
Does the fact that we're thinking about a square face and not some other shape matter?

213
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,640
No, not really.

214
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,320
Does the fact that the transformation is linear matter?

215
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,840
Yes, absolutely.

216
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,105
Alice can also apply a similar way of thinking 

217
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,760
about the average shadow for any shape like this.

218
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,000
Say we have some sequence of rotations that we apply to our square face.

219
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,560
And let's call them R1, R2, R3, and so on.

220
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,649
Then the area of the shadow in each one of those cases 

221
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,420
looks like some factor times the area of the square.

222
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,300
And that factor depends on the rotation.

223
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,495
So if we take an empirical average for that shadow across the sample of 

224
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:34,931
rotations we're looking at right now, the way it looks is to add up all 

225
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:38,320
of those shadow areas and then divide by the total number that we have.

226
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,621
Now, because of the linearity, this area of the original square 

227
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:46,460
can cleanly factor out of all of that, and it ends up on the left.

228
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
This isn't the exact average that we're looking for, 

229
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,200
it's just an empirical mean of a sample of rotations.

230
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,821
But in principle what we're looking for is what this 

231
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,640
approaches as the size of our sample approaches infinity.

232
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,617
And all the parts that depend on the size of the 

233
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,040
sample sit cleanly away from the area itself.

234
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,460
So whatever this approaches in the limit, it's just going to be some number.

235
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,840
It might be a royal pain to compute, we're not sure about that yet, 

236
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,861
but the thing that Alice notes is that it's independent of the size 

237
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,660
and the shape of the particular 2D thing that we're looking at.

238
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a universal proportionality constant.

239
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,640
And her hope is that that universality somehow lends 

240
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,940
itself to a more elegant way to deduce what it must be.

241
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,282
Now Bob would be eager to compute this constant here and now, 

242
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,720
and in a few minutes I'll show you how he does it.

243
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,906
But before that I do want to stay in Alice's world for a little bit more, 

244
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:36,960
because this is where things start to really get fun.

245
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,627
In her desire to understand the overall structure of the question 

246
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:47,337
before diving into the details, she's curious now about how the area 

247
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:51,100
of the shadow of the cube relates to the area of its individual faces.

248
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,010
Now if we can say something about the average area of a particular face, 

249
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,400
does that tell us anything about the average area of the cube as a whole?

250
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,222
For example, a simple thing we could say is that that area is 

251
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:05,445
definitely less than the sum of the areas across all the faces, 

252
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,920
because there's a meaningful amount of overlap between those shadows.

253
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,739
But it's not entirely clear how to think about that overlap, 

254
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,991
because if we focus our attention just on two particular faces, 

255
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,380
in some orientations they don't overlap at all.

256
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,089
But in other orientations they do have some overlap, 

257
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,553
and the specific shape and area of that overlap seems a little bit tricky to think about, 

258
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:29,820
much less how on Earth we would average that across all of the different orientations.

259
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,890
But Alice has about three clever insights through this whole problem, 

260
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,460
and this is the first one of them.

261
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,588
She says, actually, if we think about the whole cube, not just a pair of faces, 

262
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,590
we can conclude that the area of the shadow for a given orientation 

263
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,180
is exactly one half the sum of the areas of all of the faces.

264
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,512
Intuitively you can maybe guess that half of them are bathed in the 

265
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:55,660
light and half of them are not, but here's the way that she justifies it.

266
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,312
She says for a particular ray of light that would go from the sky and eventually 

267
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:04,860
hit a point in the shadow, that ray passes through the cube at exactly two points.

268
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
There's one moment when it enters and one moment when it exits.

269
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,780
So every point in that shadow corresponds to exactly two faces above it.

270
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,925
Well, okay, that's not exactly true if that beam of light 

271
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,220
happened to go through the edge of one of the squares.

272
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
There's a little bit of ambiguity on how many faces it's passing.

273
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,161
But those account for zero area inside the shadow, 

274
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:29,040
so we're safe to ignore them if the thing we're trying to do is compute the area.

275
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,843
If Alice is pressed and she needs to justify why exactly this is true, 

276
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:38,666
which is important for understanding how the problem might generalize, 

277
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,820
she can appeal to the idea of convexity.

278
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,915
Convexity is one of those properties where a lot of us have an intuitive sense for 

279
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:48,580
what it should mean, you know, it's shapes that just bulge out, they never dent inward.

280
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,059
But mathematicians have a pretty clever way of 

281
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,020
formalizing it that's helpful for actual proofs.

282
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,578
They say that a set is convex if the line that connects any two 

283
00:15:57,578 --> 00:16:01,660
points inside that set is entirely contained within the set itself.

284
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,216
So, a square is convex because no matter where you put two points inside that square, 

285
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,660
the line connecting them is entirely contained inside the square.

286
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,722
But something like the symbol pi is not convex, 

287
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,742
I can easily find two different points so that the line connecting them has to 

288
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,320
peak outside of the set itself.

289
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,600
None of the letters in the word convex are themselves convex.

290
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,020
You can find two points so that the line connecting them has to pass outside of the set.

291
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,420
It's a really clever way to formalize this idea of a shape that only bulges out.

292
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,540
Because anytime that it dents inward, you can find these counterexample lines.

293
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,612
Or, our cube, because it's convex, between the first point of entry and the last 

294
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:45,180
point of exit, it has to stay entirely inside the cube by definition of convexity.

295
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,102
But if we were dealing with some other non-convex shape, like a donut, 

296
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:52,323
you could find a ray of light that enters, then exits, then enters, 

297
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:56,160
then exits again, so you wouldn't have a clean two-to-one cover from the shadows.

298
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,000
The shadows of all of its different parts, if you were to cover this in a bunch of faces, 

299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,079
would not be precisely two times the area of the shadow itself.

300
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,260
So, that's the first key insight, the face shadows double cover the cube shadow.

301
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,875
And the next one is a little bit more symbolic, 

302
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,662
so let's start things off by abbreviating our notation a little to 

303
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:14,660
make room on the screen.

304
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,914
Instead of writing the area of the shadow of the cube, 

305
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm just going to write s of the cube.

306
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,805
And similarly, instead of the area of the shadow of a particular face, 

307
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:27,732
I'm just going to write s of f, where that subscript j indicates which face I'm 

308
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:28,420
talking about.

309
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,044
But of course, we should really be talking about the 

310
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,620
shadow of a particular rotation applied to the cube.

311
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,444
So I might write this as s of some rotation applied to the cube, 

312
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:41,973
and likewise on the right, it's the area of the shadow of that same rotation applied to 

313
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,260
a given one of the faces.

314
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,605
With the more compact notation at hand, let's think about the average of this 

315
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:53,700
shadow area across many different rotations, some sample of r1, r2, r3, and so on.

316
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,617
Again, that average just involves adding up all 

317
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,220
of those shadow areas and then dividing them by n.

318
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,399
And in principle, if we were to look at this for larger and larger samples, 

319
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:07,360
let n approach infinity, that would give us the average area of the shadow of the cube.

320
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,952
Some of you might be thinking, yes, we know this, you've said this already, 

321
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:15,694
but it's beneficial to write it out so that we can understand why it is that 

322
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,630
expressing the shadow area for a particular rotation of the cube as a sum across 

323
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,420
all of its faces, or one half times that sum at least, why is that beneficial?

324
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,760
What is it going to do for us?

325
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,338
Well, let's just write it out, where for each one of these rotations of the cube, 

326
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:32,010
we could break down that shadow as a sum across that same 

327
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,900
rotation applied across all of the faces.

328
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,314
And when it's written as a grid like this, we can get to Alice's second insight, 

329
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:41,343
which is to shift the way that we're thinking about the sum from 

330
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:43,720
going row by row to instead going column by column.

331
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,337
For example, if we focused our attention just on the first column, 

332
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,879
what it's telling us is to add up the area of the shadow of the first face across many 

333
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,080
different orientations.

334
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,215
So if we were to take that sum and divide it by the size of our sample, 

335
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:02,940
that gives us an empirical average for the area of the shadow of this face.

336
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,487
So if we take larger and larger samples, letting that size go to infinity, 

337
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:10,240
this will approach the average shadow area for a square.

338
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,000
Likewise, the second column can be thought of as telling us the average area 

339
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,780
for the second face of the cube, which should of course be the same number.

340
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,550
And same deal for any other column, it's telling 

341
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,360
us the average area for a particular face.

342
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,040
So that gives us a very different way of thinking about our whole expression.

343
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,411
Instead of saying add up the areas of the cubes at all the different orientations, 

344
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:35,665
we could say just add up the average shadows for the six different 

345
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,560
faces and divide the total by one half.

346
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,857
The term on the left here is thinking about adding up rows first, 

347
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:43,760
and the term on the right is thinking about adding up columns first.

348
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,939
In short, the average of the sum of the face shadows is 

349
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:51,140
the same as the sum of the average of the face shadows.

350
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,090
Maybe that swap seems simple, maybe it doesn't, 

351
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,529
but I can tell you that there is actually a little bit more 

352
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,700
than meets the eye to the step that we just took, but we'll get to that later.

353
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,474
And remember, we know that the average area for a particular face looks 

354
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:08,220
like some universal proportionality constant times the area of that face.

355
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,492
So if we're adding this up across all the faces of the cube, 

356
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:15,200
we could think of this as equaling some constant times the surface area of the cube.

357
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,760
And that's pretty interesting.

358
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,302
The average area for the shadow of this cube is 

359
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,480
going to be proportional to its surface area.

360
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,449
But at the same time, you might complain, well Alice is just 

361
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:28,219
pushing around a bunch of symbols here, because none of this 

362
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:31,080
matters if we don't know what that proportionality constant is.

363
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,380
I mean, it almost seems obvious.

364
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,620
Like, of course the average shadow area should be proportional to the surface area.

365
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,260
They're both two-dimensional quantities, so they should scale in lockstep with each other.

366
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,380
I mean, it's not obvious.

367
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
After all, for a closer light source, it simply wouldn't be true.

368
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,338
And also, this business where we added up the grid column by column 

369
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,700
versus row by row is a little more nuanced than it might look at first.

370
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,228
There's a subtle, hidden assumption underlying all of this, 

371
00:20:58,228 --> 00:21:02,038
which carries a special significance when we choose to revisit the question 

372
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,300
of what probability distribution is being taken across the space of all orientations.

373
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,405
But more than anything, the reason that it's not obvious is that the significance 

374
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:15,360
of this result right here is not merely that these two values are proportional.

375
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,932
It's that an analogous fact will hold true for any convex solids, 

376
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,897
and, crucially, the actual content of what Alice has built up so far 

377
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:27,920
is that it'll be the same proportionality constant across all of them.

378
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,633
Now if you really mull over that, some of you may be able to 

379
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,180
predict the way that Alice is able to finish things off from here.

380
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,940
It's really delightful, it's honestly my main reason for covering this topic.

381
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,298
But before we get into it, I think it's easy to underappreciate her result 

382
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,140
unless we dig into the details of what it is that she manages to avoid.

383
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,167
So let's take a moment to turn our attention back into Bob's world, 

384
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:54,400
because while Alice has been doing all of this, he's been busy doing some computations.

385
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,439
In fact, what he's been working on is finding exactly what Alice has yet to figure out, 

386
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:03,189
which is how to take the formula that he found for the area of a square's 

387
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,888
shadow and taking the natural next step of trying to find the average of 

388
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,980
that square's shadow averaged over all possible orientations.

389
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,933
So the way Bob starts, if he's thinking about all the different possible 

390
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:21,020
orientations for this square, is to ask, what are all the different 

391
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,107
normal vectors that that square can have in all these orientations, 

392
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:27,240
because everything about its shadow comes down to that normal vector.

393
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,796
It's not too hard to see that all those possible normal vectors trace out the surface 

394
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:35,560
of a sphere, if we assume it's a unit normal vector, it's a sphere with radius 1.

395
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,975
And furthermore, Bob figures that each point of this 

396
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:41,580
sphere should be just as likely to occur as any other.

397
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,035
Our probabilities should be uniform in that way, 

398
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:46,320
there's no reason to prefer one direction over another.

399
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,302
But in the context of continuous probabilities, 

400
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:53,166
it's not very helpful to talk about the likelihood of a particular individual point, 

401
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,939
because in the uncountable infinity of points on the sphere, 

402
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,440
that would be zero and unhelpful.

403
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,440
So instead, the more precise way to phrase this uniformity would be 

404
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,263
to say the probability that our normal vector lands in any given 

405
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:09,440
patch of area on the sphere should be proportional to that area itself.

406
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,654
More specifically, it should equal the area of that little 

407
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:15,120
patch divided by the total surface area of the sphere.

408
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,456
If that's true, no matter what patch of area we're considering, 

409
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,060
that's what we mean by a uniform distribution on the sphere.

410
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,145
Now to be clear, points on the sphere are not the same thing as orientations in 3D space, 

411
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:29,553
because even if you know what normal vector this square is going to have, 

412
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:31,718
that leaves us with another degree of freedom, 

413
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:34,160
the square could be rotated about that normal vector.

414
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,628
But Bob doesn't actually have to care about that extra degree of freedom, 

415
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:41,949
because in all of those cases, the area of the shadow is the same, 

416
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:45,815
it's only dependent on the cosine of the angle between that normal vector and 

417
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,460
the vertical.

418
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,472
Which is kind of neat, all those shadows are genuinely different shapes, 

419
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,540
they're not the same, but the area of each of them will be the same.

420
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,175
What this means is that when Bob wants this average shadow area over 

421
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,680
all possible orientations, all he really needs to know is the average 

422
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,984
value of this absolute value of cosine of theta for all different 

423
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:08,440
possible normal vectors, all different possible points on the sphere.

424
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,320
So, how do you compute an average like this?

425
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,210
Well, if we lived in some kind of discrete pixelated world, 

426
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,102
where there's only a finite number of possible angles theta that 

427
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:21,440
that normal vector could have, the average would be pretty straightforward.

428
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,476
What you do is find the probability of landing on any particular value of theta, 

429
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:29,213
which will tell us something like how much of the sphere do normal vectors 

430
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:32,750
with that angle make up, and then you multiply it by the thing we want 

431
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,940
to take the average of, this formula for the area of the shadow.

432
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,396
And then you would add that up over all of the different possible values of theta, 

433
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,020
ranging from 0 up to 180 degrees, or pi radians.

434
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,350
But of course, in reality, there is a continuum of possible values of theta, 

435
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,971
this uncountable infinity, and the probability of landing on any 

436
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:55,980
specific particular value of theta will actually be 0.

437
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,070
And so a sum like this unfortunately doesn't really make any sense, 

438
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,160
or if it does make sense, adding up infinitely many zeros should just give us a 0.

439
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,880
The short answer for what we do instead is that we compute an integral.

440
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,362
And I'll level with you, the hard part here is I'm not entirely sure 

441
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:15,260
what background I should be assuming from those of you watching right now.

442
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,682
Maybe it's the case that you're quite comfortable with 

443
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,800
calculus and you don't need me to belabor the point here.

444
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,311
Maybe it's the case that you're not familiar with calculus 

445
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:24,780
and I shouldn't just be throwing down integrals like that.

446
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,634
Or maybe you, you know, you took a calculus class a while ago, 

447
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,440
but you need a little bit of a refresher.

448
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,263
I'm going to go with the option of setting this up as if it's a calculus lesson, 

449
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:36,408
because to be honest, even when you are quite comfortable with integrals, 

450
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,746
setting them up can be kind of an error-prone process, 

451
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,019
and calling back to the underlying definition is a good way to sort of check 

452
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,040
yourself in the process.

453
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,867
If we lived in a time before calculus existed and integrals weren't a thing, 

454
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:50,893
and we wanted to approximate an answer to this question, 

455
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:55,192
one way we could go about it is to take a sample of values for theta that ranges 

456
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:56,520
from 0 up to 180 degrees.

457
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,245
We might think of them as evenly spaced with some sort of difference between each one, 

458
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:02,040
some delta theta.

459
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,127
And it's still the case that it would be unhelpful to ask about the probability 

460
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:09,240
of a particular value of theta occurring, even if it's 1 in our sample.

461
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,360
That probability would still be 0 and it would be unhelpful.

462
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,041
But what is helpful to ask is the probability of falling between two different 

463
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:22,020
values from our sample, in this little band of latitude with a width of delta theta.

464
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,526
Based on our assumption that the distribution along this sphere should be uniform, 

465
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:29,560
that probability comes down to knowing the area of this band.

466
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,415
More specifically, the chances that a randomly chosen vector lands in that 

467
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:36,720
band should be that area divided by the total surface area of the sphere.

468
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,083
To figure out that area, let's first think of the radius of that band, which, 

469
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,280
if the radius of our sphere is 1, is definitely going to be smaller than 1.

470
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,996
And in fact, if we draw the appropriate little right triangle here, 

471
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:52,457
you can see that that little radius, let's just say at the top of the band, 

472
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,780
should be the sine of our angle, the sine of theta.

473
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,955
This means that the circumference of the band should be 2 pi times 

474
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:02,237
the sine of that angle, and then the area of the band should be 

475
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:05,520
that circumference times its thickness, that little delta theta.

476
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Or rather, the area of our band is approximately this quantity.

477
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,202
What's important is that for a finer sample of many more values of theta, 

478
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:16,320
the accuracy of that approximation would get better and better.

479
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,136
Now remember, the reason we wanted this area is to know the probability 

480
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:25,582
of falling into that band, which is this area divided by the surface area of the sphere, 

481
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:28,080
which we know to be 4 pi times its radius squared.

482
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,411
That's a value that you could also compute with an integral similar to the one that we're 

483
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:36,080
setting up now, but for now we can take it as a given, as a standard well-known formula.

484
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,014
And this probability itself is just a stepping stone in the direction of 

485
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:43,320
what we actually want, which is the average area for the shadow of a square.

486
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,307
To get that, we'll multiply this probability times the corresponding shadow area, 

487
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:52,722
which is this absolute value of cosine theta expression we've seen many times up to this 

488
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:53,020
point.

489
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,434
And our estimate for this average would now come down to adding up this expression 

490
00:27:57,434 --> 00:28:01,700
across all of the different bands, all of the different samples of theta that we've taken.

491
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,360
This right here, by the way, is when Bob is just totally in his element.

492
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,712
We've got a lot of exact formulas describing something very concrete, 

493
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:11,860
actually digging in on our way to a real answer.

494
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,773
And again, if it feels like a lot of detail, I want you to appreciate that fact, 

495
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:21,499
so that you can appreciate just how magical it is when Alice manages to somehow avoid all 

496
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:21,920
of this.

497
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,065
Anyway, looking back at our expression, let's clean things up a little bit, 

498
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:29,000
like factoring out all of the terms that don't depend on theta itself.

499
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,480
And we can simplify that 2 pi divided by 4 pi to simply be 1 half.

500
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,672
And to make it a little more analogous to calculus, 

501
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:39,460
with integrals, let me just swap the main terms inside the sum here.

502
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,425
What we now have, this sum that's going to approximate the answer to our question, 

503
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,040
is almost what an integral is.

504
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,973
Instead of writing the sigma for sum, we write the integral symbol, 

505
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:53,980
this kind of elongated Leibnizian s, showing us that we're going from 0 to pi.

506
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,600
And instead of describing the step size as delta theta, 

507
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,737
a concrete finite amount, we instead describe it as d theta, 

508
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:05,160
which I like to think of as signaling the fact that some kind of limit is being taken.

509
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,672
What that integral means, by definition, is whatever the 

510
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:13,580
sum on the bottom approaches for finer and finer subdivisions.

511
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,100
More dense samples that we might take for theta itself.

512
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,429
And at this point, for those of you who do know calculus, 

513
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:24,519
I'll just write down the details of how you would actually carry this out, 

514
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,620
as you might see it written down in Bob's notebook.

515
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,711
It's the usual anti-derivative stuff, but the one 

516
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:32,160
key step is to bring in a certain trig identity.

517
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:38,131
In the end, what Bob finds after doing this is the surprisingly clean fact that 

518
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:43,520
the average area for a square's shadow is precisely one half the area of that square.

519
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,560
This is the mystery constant, which Alice doesn't yet know.

520
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,063
If Bob were to look over her shoulder and see the work that she's done, 

521
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,780
he could finish out the problem right now.

522
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,160
He plugs in the constant that he just found, and he knows the final answer.

523
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,902
And now, finally, with all of this as backdrop, 

524
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:06,200
what is it that Alice does to carry out the final solution?

525
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,260
I introduced her as someone who really likes to generalize the results she finds.

526
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,899
And usually those generalizations end up as interesting footnotes 

527
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,680
that aren't really material for solving particular problems.

528
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,760
But this is a case where the generalization itself draws her to a quantitative result.

529
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,523
Remember, the substance of what she's found so far is that if you look at any convex 

530
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:31,399
solid, then the average area for its shadow is going to be proportional to its surface 

531
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:31,680
area.

532
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,500
And critically, it'll be the same proportionality constant across all of these solids.

533
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,632
So all Alice needs to do is find just a single convex solid 

534
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:44,460
out there where she already knows the average area of its shadow.

535
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,840
And some of you may see where this is going.

536
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,060
The most symmetric solid available to us is a sphere.

537
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,797
No matter what the orientation of that sphere, its shadow, 

538
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:58,020
the flat projection shadow, is always a circle with an area of pi r squared.

539
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,040
So in particular, that's its average shadow area.

540
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,320
And the surface area of a sphere, like I mentioned before, is exactly 4 pi r squared.

541
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,163
By the way, I did make a video talking all about that surface 

542
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:14,412
area formula and how Archimedes proved it thousands of years before calculus existed, 

543
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:16,340
so you don't need integrals to find it.

544
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,568
The magic of what Alice has done is that she can take this seemingly specific 

545
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:24,851
fact that the shadow of a sphere has an area exactly 1 fourth its surface area 

546
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:29,459
and use it to conclude a much more general fact that for any convex solid out there, 

547
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:33,580
its shadow and surface area are related in the same way, in a certain sense.

548
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,104
So with that, she can go and fill in the details of the particular question about a cube 

549
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:43,620
and say that its average shadow area will be 1 fourth times its surface area, 6 s squared.

550
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,210
But the much more memorable fact that you'll go to sleep thinking about 

551
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,800
is how it didn't really matter that we were talking about a cube at all.

552
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,999
Now, that's all very pretty, but some of you might complain that this 

553
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:59,380
isn't really a valid argument because spheres don't have flat faces.

554
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,286
When I said Alice's argument generalizes to any convex solid, 

555
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:07,860
if we actually look at the argument itself, it definitely depends on the use of a finite 

556
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,940
number of flat faces.

557
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,724
For example, if we were mapping it to a dodecahedron, 

558
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:15,386
you would start by saying that the area of a particular shadow of that 

559
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:19,150
dodecahedron looks like exactly 1 half times the sum of the areas of the 

560
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,440
shadows of all its faces.

561
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,112
Once again, you could use a certain ray of light 

562
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:25,440
mixed with convexity argument to draw that conclusion.

563
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,126
And remember, the benefit of expressing that shadow area as a sum is that when we want to 

564
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:35,973
average over a bunch of different rotations, we can describe that sum as a big grid where 

565
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:40,820
we can then go column by column and consider the average area for the shadow of each face.

566
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,106
And also, a critical fact was the conclusion from much earlier that 

567
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:49,181
the average shadow for any 2D object, a flat 2D object, which is important, 

568
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:52,720
will equal some universal proportionality constant times its area.

569
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,120
The significance was that that constant didn't depend on the shape itself.

570
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,392
It could have been a square, or a cat, or the pentagonal faces of our dodecahedron, 

571
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:00,840
whatever.

572
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,522
Though, after hastily carrying this over to a sphere that doesn't 

573
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:08,260
have a finite number of flat faces, you would be right to complain.

574
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,240
But luckily, it's a pretty easy detail to fill in.

575
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,845
What you can do is imagine a sequence of different polyhedra that 

576
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:18,002
successively approximate a sphere, in the sense that their faces 

577
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:21,160
hug tighter and tighter around the genuine surface of the sphere.

578
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,116
For each one of those approximations, we can draw the same conclusion, 

579
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:27,972
that its average shadow is going to be proportional to its 

580
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,780
surface area with this universal proportionality constant.

581
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,506
So then, if we say, okay, let's take the limit of the ratio between 

582
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:38,007
the average shadow area at each step and the surface area at each step, 

583
00:33:38,007 --> 00:33:41,799
well, since that ratio is never changing, it's always equal to this constant, 

584
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,620
then in the limit, it's also going to equal that constant.

585
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,083
But on the other hand, by their definition, in the limit, 

586
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:52,143
their average shadow area should be that of a circle, which is ÏrÂ², 

587
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:56,980
and the limit of the surface areas would be the surface area of the sphere, 4ÏrÂ².

588
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,093
So we do genuinely get the conclusion that intuition would suggest, 

589
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:03,566
but, as is so common with Alice's argument here, 

590
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:07,000
we do have to be a little delicate in how we justify that intuition.

591
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,711
It's easy for this contrast of Alice and Bob to come across like a value judgment, 

592
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:19,918
as if I'm saying, look how clever Alice has managed to be, 

593
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,560
she insightfully avoided all those computations that Bob had to do.

594
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,900
But that would be a very, um, misguided conclusion.

595
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,294
I think there's an important way that popularizations 

596
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:34,080
of math differ from the feeling of actually doing math.

597
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,660
There's this bias towards showing the slick proofs, 

598
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,780
the arguments with some clever keen insight that lets you avoid doing calculations.

599
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,482
I could just be projecting, since I'm very guilty of this, but what I can tell you, 

600
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:49,219
sitting on the other side of the screen here, is that it feels a lot more 

601
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,300
attractive to make a video about Alice's approach than Bob's.

602
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,663
For one thing, in Alice's approach, the line of reasoning is fun, 

603
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:57,120
it has these nice aha moments.

604
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,400
But also, crucially, the way that you explain it is more or 

605
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,900
less the same for a very wide range of mathematical backgrounds.

606
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,532
It's much less enticing to do a video about Bob's approach, 

607
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:11,243
not because the computations are all that bad, I mean, they're honestly not, 

608
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:14,859
but the pragmatic reality is that the appropriate pace to explain it looks 

609
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,860
very different depending on the different mathematical backgrounds in the audience.

610
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,457
So you, watching this right now, clearly consume math videos online, 

611
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,620
and I think in doing so it's worth being aware of this bias.

612
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,205
If the aim is to have a genuine lesson on problem solving, 

613
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:34,520
too much focus on the slick proofs runs the risk of being disingenuous.

614
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,317
For example, let's say we were to step up to challenge 

615
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,020
mode here and ask about the case with a closer light source.

616
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,321
To my knowledge, there is not a similarly slick solution to Alice's here, 

617
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:48,160
where you can just relate to a single shape like a sphere.

618
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,321
The much more productive warmup to have done would 

619
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:53,300
have been the calculus of Bob's approach.

620
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,600
And if you look at the history of this problem, 

621
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,022
it was proved by Cauchy in 1832, and if we paw through his handwritten notes, 

622
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:04,480
they look a lot more similar to Bob's work than Alice's work.

623
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,375
Right here at the top of page 11, you can see what is 

624
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,400
essentially the same integral that you and I set up in the middle.

625
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,988
On the other hand, the whole framing of the paper is to find a general fact, 

626
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,240
not something specific like the case of a cube.

627
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,819
So if we were asking the question which of these two mindsets correlates with the act of 

628
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:26,400
discovering new math, the right answer would almost certainly have to be a blend of both.

629
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,621
But I would suggest that many people don't sign enough weight to 

630
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,180
the part of that blend where you're eager to dive into calculations.

631
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
And I think there's some risk that the videos I make might contribute to that.

632
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,188
In the podcast I did with the mathematician Alex Kontorovich, 

633
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:46,041
he talked about the often underappreciated importance of just drilling on 

634
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:50,466
computations to build intuition, whether you're a student engaging with a new class, 

635
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:54,320
or a practicing research mathematician engaging with a new field of study.

636
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,040
A listener actually wrote in to highlight what an impression that particular section made.

637
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,385
They're a PhD student and describe themselves as being worried that their mathematical 

638
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:07,640
abilities were starting to fade, which they attributed to becoming older and less sharp.

639
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,833
But hearing a practicing mathematician talk about the importance of doing hundreds of 

640
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:14,320
concrete examples in order to learn something new, 

641
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
evidently that changed their perspective.

642
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,160
In their own words, recognizing this completely reshaped their outlook and their results.

643
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,888
And if you look at the famous mathematicians through history, 

644
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:27,618
you know, Newton, Euler, Gauss, all of them, they all have 

645
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:30,580
this seemingly infinite patience for doing tedious calculations.

646
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,797
The irony of being biased to show insights that let us avoid calculations 

647
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:38,616
is that the way people often train up the intuitions to find those 

648
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:42,720
insights in the first place is by doing piles and piles of calculations.

649
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,420
All that said, something would definitely be missing without the Alice mindset here.

650
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,411
I mean, think about it, how sad would it be if we solved this problem for a 

651
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:57,023
cube and we never stepped outside of the trees to see the forest and understand 

652
00:37:57,023 --> 00:38:00,320
that this is a super general fact, it applies to a huge family of shapes.

653
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,519
And if you consider that math is not just about answering the questions that are 

654
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,872
posed to you, but about introducing new ideas and constructs, 

655
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:13,630
one fun side note about Alice's approach here is that it suggests a fun way to quantify 

656
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,820
the idea of convexity.

657
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,015
Rather than just having a yes-no answer, is it convex, is it not, 

658
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:23,390
we could put a number to it by saying, consider the average area of the shadow 

659
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,211
of some solid, multiply that by four, divide it by the surface area, 

660
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:31,697
and if that number is one, you've got a convex solid, but if it's less than one, 

661
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:36,460
it's non-convex, and how close it is to one tells you how close it is to being convex.

662
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,907
Also, one of the nice things about the Alice solution here is that it 

663
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:44,606
helps explain why it is that mathematicians have what can sometimes 

664
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:48,360
look like a bizarre infatuation with generality and with abstraction.

665
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,916
The more examples that you see where generalizing and abstracting actually helps 

666
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:57,360
you to solve a specific case, the more you start to adopt the same infatuation.

667
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,027
And as a final thought for the stalwart viewers among you who've stuck through it 

668
00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:07,000
this far, there is still one unanswered question about the very premise of our puzzle.

669
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,940
What exactly does it mean to choose a random orientation?

670
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,794
Now if that feels like a silly question, like of course we know what it should mean, 

671
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:18,059
I would encourage you to watch a video that I just did with Numberphile 

672
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:20,780
on a conundrum from probability known as Bertrand's paradox.

673
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,457
After you watch it, and if you appreciate some of the nuance at play here, 

674
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:29,954
homework for you is to reflect on where exactly Alice and Bob implicitly answered this 

675
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:30,420
question.

676
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,308
The case with Bob is relatively straightforward, 

677
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:38,201
but the point at which Alice locks down some specific distribution on the space of 

678
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,500
all orientations is not at all obvious.

679
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,700
It's actually very subtle.

680
00:40:00,420 --> 00:39:41,700
.
