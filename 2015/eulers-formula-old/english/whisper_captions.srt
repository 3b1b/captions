1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,660
E raised to pi with an i.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,900
We've been taught by a lot that you've got minus one.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,600
Can we glean what this means?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,800
For such words are absurd.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,120
How to treat the repeat of a feat pi i times.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,620
This is bound to confound till your mind redefines these amounts one can't count which surmount

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,280
our friend E.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,820
Numbers act as abstract functions which slide the ridge to the space in its place with a

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,640
grace when they sum.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,520
Multiplied they don't slide acting a second way they rotate and dilate but keep straight

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,300
the same plane.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,540
Now what we write as E to the X won't perplex when you know it's for show that X goes up

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,900
and right.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
It does not as you thought repeat E product E. It functions with gumption on functions

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,020
we've now seen.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,040
It turns slide side to side into growths and shrinks both.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,720
Up and downs come around as turns round which is key.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,780
This is why pi times i which slides north is brought forth and returned we have learned

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,080
as a turn halfway round.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,080
Minus one matched by none turns this way and we're done.
