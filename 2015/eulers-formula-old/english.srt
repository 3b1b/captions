1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,740
E raised to pi with an i.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,580
We've been taught by a lot that you've got minus one.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,740
Can we glean what this means?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,740
For such words are absurd.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,760
How to treat the repeat of a feat pi i times.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,660
This is bound to confound till your mind redefines these amounts one can't count which surmount

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,300
our friend E.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,740
Numbers act as abstract functions which slide the ridge to the space in its place with a

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,780
grace when they sum.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,780
They slide, they don't slide.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,900
Acting a second way, they rotate and dilate but keep straight this same plane.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,500
Now what we write as E to the X won't perplex when you know it's for show that X goes up

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
and right.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,300
It does not, as you thought, repeat E product E. It functions with gumption on functions

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,660
we have now seen.

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,500
It turns slide side to side into growths and shrinks both.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,280
Up and downs come around as turns round which is key.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,820
This is why pi times i which slides north is brought forth and returned, we have learned,

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,840
is a turn halfway round.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,120
This one, matched by none, turns this way and we're done.
