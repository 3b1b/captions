00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,420
In my last video, I posed the following question.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,017
If you take n points on a circle, then connect every pair of them with a line, 

3
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:13,740
how many sections do these lines cut the circle into?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,146
What was strange is that when n is less than 6, 

5
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:20,640
and when n is 10 for some reason, the answer is always a power of 2.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,140
But for all other values of n, the answer seems completely unrelated to powers of 2.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,663
What I love about this problem is that it brings together many disparate concepts, 

8
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:34,460
counting functions, graphs, one of Euler's most famous equations, and Pascal's triangle.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,240
You might be wondering if changing the placement of points changes the number of sections.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,600
It actually can.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,203
For instance, watch how this small region in the middle disappears 

12
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:48,360
if we adjust things so that three lines go through the same point.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,524
But if we add the restriction that no three lines can go through the same point, 

14
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:55,194
the number of sections depends only on the number of points, 

15
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:57,120
not their placement, as you're about to see.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,631
I think it's fair to call this a hard problem, and in solving hard problems, 

17
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:04,700
it's a good idea to ask simpler questions about the same setup.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,020
In this case, I have two questions for you.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:07,620
1.

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,520
How many lines are there?

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,200
And 2.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,880
At how many points do these lines intersect within the circle?

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,091
For the first question, every line corresponds uniquely with a pair of points, 

24
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,000
and likewise every pair of points gives us a unique line.

25
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,531
Luckily, counting the number of pairs in a set is common enough in math that we have 

26
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:34,240
specific notation for it, n choose 2, which we evaluate as n times n minus 1 divided by 2.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,835
To see where this formula comes from, notice that you have n options for the 

28
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,862
first element of the pair, which we multiply by the n minus 1 remaining options 

29
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:46,940
for the second element, but this would double count each pair, so we divide by 2.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,781
For instance, when n equals 7, 7 choose 2 is 7 times 6 over 2, 

31
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:57,260
or 21, so there are 21 pairs of points, and hence 21 lines.

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,284
With, say, 100 points, counting lines directly would be a nightmare, 

33
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:09,039
but we can compute it as 100 choose 2, which is 100 times 99 divided by 2, or 4950.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,280
The number of intersection points is a bit more subtle.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,999
While every intersection point corresponds with a unique pair of lines, 

36
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,187
there are many pairs of lines that don't intersect within the circle, 

37
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:21,100
so we can't just count the pairs of lines.

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,690
What we can do, though, is associate each intersection point with a set 

39
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,914
of 4 points on the circle, since this association goes the other way around, 

40
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:33,700
in that every quadruplet of points gives a unique intersection point.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
Just look at that, isn't that elegant?

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,210
This means the number of intersection points is the same 

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,760
as the number of quadruplets of our n starting points.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,499
The function n choose 4 counts quadruplets in a set of size n, 

45
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:50,306
and you evaluate it by taking n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 times n minus 3, 

46
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:52,740
all divided by 1 times 2 times 3 times 4.

47
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,640
The derivation of this formula is similar to that of n choose 2.

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,031
You multiply in the number of options you have for each successive entry, 

49
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,900
then divide by the extent to which you've overcounted.

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,750
For instance, with n equals 4, 4 choose 4 is 1, 

51
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,560
and indeed, there's just one intersection point.

52
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,460
6 choose 4 is 15, so when n equals 6, there are 15 intersection points.

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,198
And if n were 100, even though the prospect of counting intersection points 

54
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:28,520
is horrifying, we can nevertheless deduce that there will be 3,921,225 of them.

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,820
Now how does this help us count sections in the circle, you might ask?

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,440
Well, it will once we consider graphs and Euler's formula.

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,700
No, no, not function graphs, and not that e to the pi i stuff.

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,048
The word graph can also refer to a set of points, referred to as vertices, 

59
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:48,060
along with a set of lines connecting some of these points, which we call edges.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,410
Notice, if we count the number of vertices in this graph, 

61
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,155
then subtract the number of edges, then add the number of regions 

62
00:03:56,155 --> 00:04:00,240
that this graph cuts space into, along with that outer region, we get 2.

63
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,120
If we do the same thing with this other graph, well, we get 2 again.

64
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,350
This isn't a coincidence, you could do this with any graph, 

65
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,420
and as long as your edges don't intersect each other, the answer is always 2.

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,568
If edges could intersect, then you could just change the number of regions without 

67
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:24,600
changing the number of vertices and edges, so of course it would be nonsense.

68
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,447
This relation is known as Euler's characteristic formula, 

69
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:32,580
and it's easy to see where the name comes from, since Euler's is German for beautiful.

70
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,519
If you're curious, the reason we write f for the number of regions is because the 

71
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,120
formula traditionally refers to the number of vertices, edges, and faces of 3D polyhedra.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,852
In another video, I'll explain why this is true, 

73
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,380
but here, let's just use it to solve our circle problem.

74
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,786
Our setup is already a graph, with n vertices and n choose 2 edges, 

75
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:56,041
one between each pair of points, but we cannot apply Euler's characteristic 

76
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,800
formula directly, since our edges intersect many times, n choose 4 times to be exact.

77
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,734
However, if we consider each intersection point to be a vertex, 

78
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:08,035
meaning our original lines must be chopped up at these points, 

79
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:11,547
and if we also include the segments of the circle connecting our n 

80
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:15,740
outer points as new edges, we have a graph perfectly suited for Euler's formula.

81
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,360
In particular, the number of regions in this picture is the number 

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,080
of edges in our new graph minus the number of vertices plus 2.

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Since our new graph retains the n original vertices and adds on another n choose 4 

84
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,160
for intersection points, we replace the minus v term with minus n minus n choose 4.

85
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,787
To find the number of edges, note that the intersection points 

86
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,052
can be seen as adding two edges each, since each one takes 

87
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:46,540
two existing lines and then cuts them into four smaller pieces.

88
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,797
For example, three lines intersecting at two points 

89
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:54,380
would be cut into 3 plus 2 times 2 equals 7 smaller pieces.

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,040
Four lines intersecting at three points would be 

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,060
cut into 4 plus 2 times 3 equals 10 smaller pieces.

92
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,834
And in our circle diagram, our n choose 2 lines intersecting at n choose 

93
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:10,165
4 points are cutting to n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 smaller pieces, 

94
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:14,380
plus another n for the circle segments we're now considering to be edges.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,407
Going back to our formula, we can replace E with 

96
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:21,260
n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 plus n.

97
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,597
Combining like terms, we see that our graph cuts the 

98
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:28,060
2d plane into 2 plus n choose 2 plus n choose 4 pieces.

99
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,521
Since we're concerned with counting the regions inside the circle, 

100
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:36,611
we can disregard that outer region and write our final answer as 1 plus n choose 2 

101
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:37,400
plus n choose 4.

102
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,460
Great, we found the answer!

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,063
But why on earth does this formula relate to powers of 2 for n less than 6, 

104
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,620
then again when n equals 10?

105
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,240
It's not just a coincidence, it has to do with Pascal's triangle.

106
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,120
Pascal's triangle is constructed like this.

107
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,180
Each term is the sum of the two terms above it.

108
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,020
If you add up each row, you get a successive power of 2.

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,354
To convince yourself of this, notice that each term is added into the following 

110
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:09,300
row twice, so the sum of each row should be twice the sum of the row before it.

111
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,542
The function n choose k is closely related to this triangle, 

112
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:18,340
in that the kth entry of the nth row where counting starts at 0 is always n choose k.

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,357
For instance, to find 5 choose 3 in the triangle, count down to the 0, 1, 

114
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:29,760
2, 3, 4, 5th row, then go in 0, 1, 2, 3, and indeed 5 choose 3 equals 10.

115
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,644
This means that the answer to our circle problem for n points is the sum of the 0th, 

116
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:38,920
2nd, and 4th entries of the nth row of Pascal's triangle.

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,560
For instance, if n equals 5, we can see that we just have to add 1, 10, and 5.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,465
Since each term is the sum of the two above it, 

119
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:51,420
this is the same as adding the entire 4th row, which we know is a power of 2.

120
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,906
Likewise, for smaller values of n, the answer is going to 

121
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,700
be the sum of the n minus 1st row, then hence a power of 2.

122
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,563
However, when n equals 6 and we relate the terms to the 5th row, 

123
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:08,423
notice that we're not adding the entire row, since we missed that last term, 

124
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:09,560
so we only get 31.

125
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,588
When n equals 10, we're summing precisely half of the 9th row, 

126
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:18,760
so the answer is half of 2 to the 9th, which is 2 to the 8th.

127
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,392
So to recap, first, turn our diagram into a graph suitable for Euler's characteristic 

128
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:28,240
formula by adding all of the intersection points as vertices and cutting up all the edges.

129
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,841
Next, count the number of lines and intersection points by 

130
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:35,100
relating them to pairs and quadruplets of our starting points.

131
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,835
Then finally, use Euler's formula to deduce the number of sections 

132
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:42,179
and then relate this to powers of 2 using Pascal's triangle.
