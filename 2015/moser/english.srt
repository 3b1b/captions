00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
In my last video, I posed the following question.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,280
If you take n points on a circle, then connect every pair of them with a line, how many sections

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,120
do these lines cut the circle into?

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,440
What was strange is that when n is less than 6, and when n is 10 for some reason, the answer

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,320
is always a power of 2.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,140
But for all other values of n, the answer seems completely unrelated to powers of 2.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,140
What I love about this problem is that it brings together many disparate concepts, counting

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,660
functions, graphs, one of Euler's most famous equations, and Pascal's triangle.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,860
You might be wondering if changing the placement of points changes the number of sections.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,860
It actually can.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,440
For instance, watch how this small region in the middle disappears if we adjust things

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,100
so that three lines go through the same point.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,780
But if we add the restriction that no three lines can go through the same point, the number

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,700
of sections depends only on the number of points, not their placement, as you're about

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,700
to see.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,200
I think it's fair to call this a hard problem, and in solving hard problems, it's a good

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,260
idea to ask simpler questions about the same setup.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,420
In this case, I have two questions for you.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,420
1.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,900
How many lines are there?

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
And 2.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,500
At how many points do these lines intersect within the circle?

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,940
For the first question, every line corresponds uniquely with a pair of points, and likewise

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,740
every pair of points gives us a unique line.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,760
Luckily, counting the number of pairs in a set is common enough in math that we have

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,980
specific notation for it, n choose 2, which we evaluate as n times n minus 1 divided by

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,980
2.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,020
To see where this formula comes from, notice that you have n options for the first element

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,340
of the pair, which we multiply by the n minus 1 remaining options for the second element,

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,500
but this would double count each pair, so we divide by 2.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,140
For instance, when n equals 7, 7 choose 2 is 7 times 6 over 2, or 21, so there are 21

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,620
pairs of points, and hence 21 lines.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,600
With, say, 100 points, counting lines directly would be a nightmare, but we can compute it

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,080
as 100 choose 2, which is 100 times 99 divided by 2, or 4950.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,960
The number of intersection points is a bit more subtle.

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,620
While every intersection point corresponds with a unique pair of lines, there are many

37
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,500
pairs of lines that don't intersect within the circle, so we can't just count the pairs

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
of lines.

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,780
What we can do, though, is associate each intersection point with a set of 4 points

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,520
on the circle, since this association goes the other way around, in that every quadruplet

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,380
of points gives a unique intersection point.

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,740
Just look at that, isn't that elegant?

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,620
This means the number of intersection points is the same as the number of quadruplets of

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,220
our n starting points.

45
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,140
The function n choose 4 counts quadruplets in a set of size n, and you evaluate it by

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,100
taking n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 times n minus 3, all divided by 1 times 2 times

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,580
3 times 4.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,140
The derivation of this formula is similar to that of n choose 2.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,620
You multiply in the number of options you have for each successive entry, then divide

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,340
by the extent to which you've overcounted.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,220
For instance, with n equals 4, 4 choose 4 is 1, and indeed, there's just one intersection

52
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,220
point.

53
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,420
6 choose 4 is 15, so when n equals 6, there are 15 intersection points.

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,340
And if n were 100, even though the prospect of counting intersection points is horrifying,

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,300
we can nevertheless deduce that there will be 3,921,225 of them.

56
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,140
Now, how does this help us count sections in the circle, you might ask?

57
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,740
Well, it will once we consider Graff's and Euler's formula.

58
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,300
No, not function graphs, and not that e to the pi i stuff.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,940
The word graph can also refer to a set of points, referred to as vertices, along with

60
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,820
a set of lines connecting some of these points, which we call edges.

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,780
Notice, if we count the number of vertices in this graph, then subtract the number of

62
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,480
edges, then add the number of regions that this graph cuts space into, along with that

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
outer region, we get 2.

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,480
If we do the same thing with this other graph, well, we get 2 again.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,520
This isn't a coincidence, you could do this with any graph, and as long as your edges

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,400
don't intersect each other, the answer is always 2.

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,880
If edges could intersect, then you could just change the number of regions without changing

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,940
the number of vertices and edges, so of course it would be nonsense.

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,840
This relation is known as Euler's characteristic formula, and it's easy to see where the

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,380
name comes from, since Euler's is German for beautiful.

71
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,360
If you're curious, the reason we write f for the number of regions is because the formula

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,780
traditionally refers to the number of vertices, edges, and faces of 3D polyhedra.

73
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,580
In another video, I'll explain why this is true, but here, let's just use it to solve

74
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,080
our circle problem.

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Our setup is already a graph, with n vertices and n choose 2 edges, one between each pair

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,440
of points, but we cannot apply Euler's characteristic formula directly, since our edges intersect

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
many times.

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,280
We choose 4 times to be exact.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,960
However, if we consider each intersection point to be a vertex, meaning our original

80
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,960
lines must be chopped up at these points, and if we also include the segments of the

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,960
circle connecting our n outer points as new edges, we have a graph perfectly suited for

82
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,440
Euler's formula.

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,080
In particular, the number of regions in this picture is the number of edges in our new

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,500
graph minus the number of vertices plus 2.

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Since our new graph retains the n original vertices and adds on another n choose 4 for

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,340
intersection points, we replace the minus v term with minus n minus n choose 4.

87
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,700
To find the number of edges, note that the intersection points can be seen as adding

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,060
two edges each, since each one takes two existing lines and then cuts them into four smaller

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
pieces.

90
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,780
For example, three lines intersecting at two points would be cut into 3 plus 2 times 2

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,260
equals 7 smaller pieces.

92
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,600
Four lines intersecting at three points would be cut into 4 plus 2 times 3 equals 10 smaller

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
pieces.

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,940
And in our circle diagram, our n choose 2 lines intersecting at n choose 4 points are

95
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,660
cutting to n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4 smaller pieces plus another n for the circle

96
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,260
segments we're now considering to be edges.

97
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,700
Going back to our formula, we can replace E with n choose 2 plus 2 times n choose 4

98
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
plus n.

99
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,780
Combining like terms, we see that our graph cuts the 2d plane into 2 plus n choose 2 plus

100
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,260
n choose 4 pieces.

101
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,780
Since we're concerned with counting the regions inside the circle, we can disregard

102
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,860
that outer region and write our final answer as 1 plus n choose 2 plus n choose 4.

103
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Great, we found the answer!

104
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,620
But why on earth does this formula relate to powers of 2 for n less than 6, then again

105
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,900
when n equals 10?

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,660
It's not just a coincidence, it has to do with Pascal's triangle.

107
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,740
Pascal's triangle is constructed like this.

108
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,860
Each term is the sum of the two terms above it.

109
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,180
If you add up each row, you get a successive power of 2.

110
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,180
To convince yourself of this, notice that each term is added into the following row

111
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,140
twice, so the sum of each row should be twice the sum of the row before it.

112
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,460
The function n choose k is closely related to this triangle, in that the kth entry of

113
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,980
the nth row where counting starts at 0 is always n choose k.

114
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,420
For instance, to find 5 choose 3 in the triangle, count down to the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th row,

115
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,780
then go in 0, 1, 2, 3, and indeed 5 choose 3 equals 10.

116
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,300
This means that the answer to our circle problem for n points is the sum of the 0th, 2nd, and

117
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,460
4th entries of the nth row of Pascal's triangle.

118
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,140
For instance, if n equals 5, we can see that we just have to add 1, 10, and 5.

119
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,220
Since each term is the sum of the two above it, this is the same as adding the entire

120
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,980
4th row, which we know is a power of 2.

121
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,220
Likewise, for smaller values of n, the answer is going to be the sum of the n minus first

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,700
row, then hence a power of 2.

123
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,860
However, when n equals 6 and we relate the terms to the 5th row, notice that we're not

124
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,540
adding the entire row, since we missed that last term, so we only get 31.

125
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,180
When n equals 10, we're summing precisely half of the 9th row, so the answer is half

126
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,900
of 2 to the 9th, which is 2 to the 8th.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,900
So to recap, first, turn our diagram into a graph suitable for Euler's characteristic

128
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,860
formula by adding all of the intersection points as vertices and cutting up all the

129
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
edges.

130
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,060
Next, count the number of lines and intersection points by relating them to pairs and quadruplets

131
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,700
of our starting points.

132
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,360
And finally, use Euler's formula to deduce the number of sections and then relate this

133
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,580
to powers of 2 using Pascal's triangle.
