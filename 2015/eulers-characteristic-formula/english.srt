00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
In my video on the circle division problem, I referenced Euler's characteristic formula,

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,340
and here I would like to share a particularly nice proof of this fact. It's very different

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,640
from the inductive proof, typically given, but I'm not trying to argue that this is somehow

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,660
better or easier to understand than other proofs. Instead, I chose this topic to illustrate

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,620
one example of the incredible notion of duality, and how it can produce wonderfully elegant

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,620
math. First, let's go over what the theorem states. If you draw some dots and some lines

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,420
between them, that is, a graph, and if none of these lines intersect, which is to say

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,740
you have a planar graph, and if your drawing is connected, then Euler's formula tells us

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,020
that the number of dots minus the number of lines plus the number of regions these lines

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,600
cut the plane into, including that outer region, will always be 2. Because Euler was originally

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,840
talking about 3D polyhedra when he found this formula, which was only later reframed in terms

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,200
of planar graphs, instead of saying dots, we say vertices, instead of saying lines, we say edges,

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,800
and instead of saying regions, we say faces. Hence, we write Euler's discovery as V minus

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,120
E plus F equals 2. Before describing the proof, I need to go through three pieces of graph theory

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,160
terminology. Cycles, spanning trees, and dual graphs. If you are already familiar with some

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,160
of these topics and don't care to see how I describe them, feel free to click the appropriate

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,160
annotation and skip ahead. Imagine a tiny creature sitting on one of the vertices. Let's name him

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,880
Randolph. If we think of edges as something Randolph might travel along from one vertex to

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,760
the next, we can sensibly talk about a path as being a sequence of edges that Randolph could

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,120
travel along, where we don't allow him to backtrack on the same edge. A cycle is simply a path that

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,240
ends on the same vertex where it begins. You might be able to guess how cycles will be important for

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,040
our purposes, since they will always enclose a set of faces. Now imagine that Randolph wants access

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,840
to all other vertices, but edges are expensive, so he'll only buy access to an edge if it gives

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,400
him a path to an untouched vertex. This frugality will leave him with a set of edges without any

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,320
cycles, since the edge finishing off a cycle would always be unnecessary. In general, a connected

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,720
graph without cycles is called a tree, so named because we can move things around and make it look

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,360
like a system of branches, and any tree inside a graph which touches all the vertices is called

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,640
a spanning tree. Before defining the dual graph, which runs the risk of being confusing, it's

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,240
important to remember why people actually care about graphs in the first place. I was actually

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,600
lying earlier when I said a graph is a set of dots and lines. Really, it's a set of anything with any

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,600
notion of connection, but we typically represent those things with dots and those connections with

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,120
lines. For instance, Facebook stores an enormous graph where vertices are accounts and edges are

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,360
friendships. Although we could use drawings to represent this graph, the graph itself is the

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,360
abstract set of accounts and friendships, completely distinct from the drawing. All sorts of things are

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,560
undrawn graphs, the set of English words considered connected when they differ by one letter,

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,560
mathematicians considered connected if they've written a paper together, neurons connected by

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,680
synapses. Or, maybe, for those of us reasoning about the actual drawing of a graph on the plane,

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,080
we can take the set of faces this graph cuts the plane into and consider two of them connected if

39
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,360
they share an edge. In other words, if you can draw a graph on the plane without intersecting

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,800
edges, you automatically get a second, as of yet undrawn, graph whose vertices are the faces and

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:56,320
whose edges are, well, edges of the original graph. We call this the dual of the original graph. If

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,800
you want to represent the dual graph with dots and lines, first put a dot inside each one of the faces.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,840
I personally like to visualize the dot for that outer region as being a point somewhere at infinity

44
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,160
where you can travel in any direction to get there. Next, connect these new dots with new lines that

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,240
pass through the centers of the old lines, where lines connected to that point at infinity can go

46
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,720
off the screen in any direction, as long as it's understood that they all meet up at the same one

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,520
point. But keep in mind, this is just the drawing of the dual graph, just like the representation

48
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,200
of Facebook accounts and friendships with dots and lines is just a drawing of the social graph.

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,840
The dual graph itself is the collection of faces and edges. The reason I stress this point is to

50
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,400
emphasize that edges of the original graph and edges of the dual graph are not just related,

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,120
they're the same thing. You see, what makes the dual graph all kinds of awesome is the many ways

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,840
that it relates to the original graph. For example, cycles in the original graph correspond to

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,480
connected components of the dual graph, and likewise, cycles in the dual graph correspond

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,960
with connected components in the original graph. Now for the cool part. Suppose our friend Randolph

55
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,280
has an alter ego, Mortimer, living in the dual graph, traveling from face to face instead of

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,960
from vertex to vertex, passing over edges as he does so. Let's say Randolph has bought all the

57
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,640
edges of a spanning tree and that Mortimer is forbidden from crossing those edges. It turns

58
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,080
out the edges that Mortimer has available to him are guaranteed to form a spanning tree of the dual

59
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,080
graph. To see why, we only need to check the two defining properties of spanning trees. They must

60
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,600
give Mortimer access to all faces and there can be no cycles. The reason he still has access to

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,640
all faces is that it would take a cycle in Randolph's spanning tree to insulate him from

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,640
a face, but trees cannot have cycles. The reason Mortimer cannot traverse a cycle in the dual graph

63
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,000
feels completely symmetric. If he could, he would separate one set of Randolph's vertices from the

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,720
rest, so the spanning tree from which he is banned could not have spanned the whole graph.

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:24,320
So not only does the planar graph have a dual graph, any spanning tree within that graph always

66
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,920
has a dual spanning tree in the dual graph. Here's the kicker. The number of vertices in

67
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,840
any tree is always one more than the number of edges. To see this, note that after you start with

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,320
the root vertex, each new edge gives exactly one new vertex. Alternatively, within our narrative,

69
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,200
you could think of Randolph as starting with one vertex and gaining exactly one more for each edge

70
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,960
in what will become a spanning tree. Since this tree covers all vertices in our graph,

71
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,680
the number of vertices is one more than the number of edges owned by Randolph. Moreover,

72
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,520
since the remaining edges make up a spanning tree for Mortimer's dual graph, the number of edges he

73
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,320
gets is one more than the number of vertices in the dual graph, which are faces of the original

74
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,600
graph. Putting this together, it means the total number of edges is two more than the number of

75
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,920
vertices plus the number of faces, which is exactly what Euler's formula states.
