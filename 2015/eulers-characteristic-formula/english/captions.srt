00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,158
In my video on the circle division problem, I referenced Euler's characteristic formula, 

2
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:11,980
and here I would like to share a particularly nice proof of this fact.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,475
It's very different from the inductive proof, typically given, 

4
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:19,152
but I'm not trying to argue that this is somehow better or easier to understand 

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:19,980
than other proofs.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,380
Instead, I chose this topic to illustrate one example of the incredible 

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,880
notion of duality, and how it can produce wonderfully elegant math.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,100
First, let's go over what the theorem states.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,790
If you draw some dots and some lines between them, that is, a graph, 

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,406
and if none of these lines intersect, which is to say you have a planar graph, 

11
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:44,670
and if your drawing is connected, then Euler's formula tells us that the 

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,993
number of dots minus the number of lines plus the number of regions these 

13
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:53,200
lines cut the plane into, including that outer region, will always be 2.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,876
Because Euler was originally talking about 3D polyhedra when he found this formula, 

15
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:03,308
which was only later reframed in terms of planar graphs, instead of saying dots, 

16
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:08,068
we say vertices, instead of saying lines, we say edges, and instead of saying regions, 

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,780
we say faces.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,480
Hence, we write Euler's discovery as V minus E plus F equals 2.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,948
Before describing the proof, I need to go through 

20
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,760
three pieces of graph theory terminology.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,020
Cycles, spanning trees, and dual graphs.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,114
If you are already familiar with some of these topics and don't care to see how 

23
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:29,580
I describe them, feel free to click the appropriate annotation and skip ahead.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,220
Imagine a tiny creature sitting on one of the vertices.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,500
Let's name him Randolph.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,333
If we think of edges as something Randolph might travel along from one vertex to 

27
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,236
the next, we can sensibly talk about a path as being a sequence of edges that 

28
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,440
Randolph could travel along, where we don't allow him to backtrack on the same edge.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,220
A cycle is simply a path that ends on the same vertex where it begins.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,641
You might be able to guess how cycles will be important for our purposes, 

31
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:59,880
since they will always enclose a set of faces.

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,103
Now imagine that Randolph wants access to all other vertices, but edges are expensive, 

33
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:10,820
so he'll only buy access to an edge if it gives him a path to an untouched vertex.

34
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,298
This frugality will leave him with a set of edges without any cycles, 

35
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:18,900
since the edge finishing off a cycle would always be unnecessary.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,241
In general, a connected graph without cycles is called a tree, 

37
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:28,940
so named because we can move things around and make it look like a system of branches.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,400
And any tree inside a graph which touches all the vertices is called a spanning tree.

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,173
Before defining the dual graph, which runs the risk of being confusing, 

40
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:43,180
it's important to remember why people actually care about graphs in the first place.

41
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,220
I was actually lying earlier when I said a graph is a set of dots and lines.

42
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,832
Really, it's a set of anything with any notion of connection, 

43
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:55,080
but we typically represent those things with dots and those connections with lines.

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,534
For instance, Facebook stores an enormous graph 

45
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:01,700
where vertices are accounts and edges are friendships.

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,194
Although we could use drawings to represent this graph, 

47
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:08,440
the graph itself is the abstract set of accounts and friendships, 

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,260
completely distinct from the drawing.

49
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,734
All sorts of things are undrawn graphs, the set of English words considered 

50
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:19,667
connected when they differ by one letter, mathematicians considered 

51
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:24,120
connected if they've written a paper together, neurons connected by synapses.

52
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,247
Or, maybe, for those of us reasoning about the actual drawing of a graph on the plane, 

53
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:34,269
we can take the set of faces this graph cuts the plane into and 

54
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,600
consider two of them connected if they share an edge.

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,892
In other words, if you can draw a graph on the plane without intersecting edges, 

56
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:47,186
you automatically get a second, as of yet undrawn, 

57
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:53,000
graph whose vertices are the faces and whose edges are, well, edges of the original graph.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,120
We call this the dual of the original graph.

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,435
If you want to represent the dual graph with dots and lines, 

60
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,000
first put a dot inside each one of the faces.

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,551
I personally like to visualize the dot for that outer region as being a 

62
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:11,580
point somewhere at infinity where you can travel in any direction to get there.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,381
Next, connect these new dots with new lines that pass through the centers of the 

64
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,758
old lines, where lines connected to that point at infinity can go off the screen in 

65
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:25,240
any direction, as long as it's understood that they all meet up at the same one point.

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,120
But keep in mind, this is just the drawing of the dual graph, 

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,419
just like the representation of Facebook accounts and friendships 

68
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,320
with dots and lines is just a drawing of the social graph.

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,260
The dual graph itself is the collection of faces and edges.

70
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,038
The reason I stress this point is to emphasize that edges of the original 

71
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,200
graph and edges of the dual graph are not just related, they're the same thing.

72
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,146
You see, what makes the dual graph all kinds of awesome 

73
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:55,080
is the many ways that it relates to the original graph.

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,440
For example, cycles in the original graph correspond to connected 

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,220
components of the dual graph, and likewise, cycles in the dual 

76
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,120
graph correspond with connected components in the original graph.

77
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,520
Now for the cool part.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,479
Suppose our friend Randolph has an alter ego, Mortimer, living in the dual graph, 

79
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,016
traveling from face to face instead of from vertex to vertex, 

80
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,900
passing over edges as he does so.

81
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,318
Let's say Randolph has bought all the edges of a spanning 

82
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:26,460
tree and that Mortimer is forbidden from crossing those edges.

83
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,585
It turns out the edges that Mortimer has available to him 

84
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:34,640
are guaranteed to form a spanning tree of the dual graph.

85
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,000
To see why, we only need to check the two defining properties of spanning trees.

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,160
They must give Mortimer access to all faces and there can be no cycles.

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,228
The reason he still has access to all faces is that it would take a cycle in 

88
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:58,240
Randolph's spanning tree to insulate him from a face, but trees cannot have cycles.

89
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,540
The reason Mortimer cannot traverse a cycle in the dual graph feels completely symmetric.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,473
If he could, he would separate one set of Randolph's vertices from the rest so 

91
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:15,060
the spanning tree from which he is banned could not have spanned the whole graph.

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,411
So not only does the planar graph have a dual graph, 

93
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:26,460
any spanning tree within that graph always has a dual spanning tree in the dual graph.

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Here's the kicker.

95
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,280
The number of vertices in any tree is always one more than the number of edges.

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,290
To see this, note that after you start with the root vertex, 

97
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,920
each new edge gives exactly one new vertex.

98
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,281
Alternatively, within our narrative, you could think of Randolph 

99
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,716
as starting with one vertex and gaining exactly one more for 

100
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:53,040
each edge that he buys in what will become a spanning tree.

101
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,433
Since this tree covers all vertices in our graph, 

102
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:00,480
the number of vertices is one more than the number of edges owned by Randolph.

103
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,982
Moreover, since the remaining edges make up a spanning tree for Mortimer's dual graph, 

104
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:10,685
the number of edges he gets is one more than the number of vertices in the dual graph, 

105
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,740
which are faces of the original graph.

106
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,592
Putting this together, it means the total number of edges is two more than the number 

107
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:21,580
of vertices plus the number of faces, which is exactly what Euler's formula states.
