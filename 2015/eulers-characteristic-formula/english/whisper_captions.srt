In my video on the circle division problem, I referenced Euler's characteristic formula,

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,340
and here I would like to share a particularly nice proof of this fact. It's very different

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,420
from the inductive proof, typically given, but I'm not trying to argue that this is somehow

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,640
better or easier to understand than other proofs. Instead, I chose this topic to illustrate

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,500
one example of the incredible notion of duality, and how it can produce wonderfully elegant

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,640
math. First, let's go over what the theorem states. If you draw some dots and some lines

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,520
between them, that is, a graph, and if none of these lines intersect, which is to say

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,820
you have a planar graph, and if your drawing is connected, then Euler's formula tells us

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,040
that the number of dots minus the number of lines plus the number of regions these lines

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,620
cut the plane into, including that outer region, will always be 2. Because Euler was originally

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,860
talking about 3D polyhedra when he found this formula, which was only later reframed in terms

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,240
of planar graphs, instead of saying dots, we say vertices, instead of saying lines, we say edges,

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,060
and instead of saying regions, we say faces. Hence, we write Euler's discovery as V minus E

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,100
plus F equals 2. Before describing the proof, I need to go through three pieces of graph theory

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,180
terminology. Cycles, spanning trees, and dual graphs. If you are already familiar with some

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,140
of these topics and don't care to see how I describe them, feel free to click the appropriate

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,240
annotation and skip ahead. Imagine a tiny creature sitting on one of the vertices. Let's name him

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,920
Randolph. If we think of edges as something Randolph might travel along from one vertex to

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,800
the next, we can sensibly talk about a path as being a sequence of edges that Randolph could

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,220
travel along, where we don't allow him to backtrack on the same edge. A cycle is simply a path that

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,020
ends on the same vertex where it begins. You might be able to guess how cycles will be important

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,620
for our purposes, since they will always enclose a set of faces. Now imagine that Randolph wants

23
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:08,080
access to all other vertices, but edges are expensive, so he'll only buy access to an edge

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,860
if it gives him a path to an untouched vertex. This frugality will leave him with a set of edges

25
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,360
without any cycles, since the edge finishing off a cycle would always be unnecessary. In general,

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,340
a connected graph without cycles is called a tree, so named because we can move things around and

27
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,660
make it look like a system of branches. And any tree inside a graph which touches all the vertices

28
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,060
is called a spanning tree. Before defining the dual graph, which runs the risk of being confusing,

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,940
it's important to remember why people actually care about graphs in the first place. I was

30
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,660
actually lying earlier when I said a graph is a set of dots and lines. Really, it's a set of

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,740
anything with any notion of connection, but we typically represent those things with dots and

32
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,420
those connections with lines. For instance, Facebook stores an enormous graph where vertices

33
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,820
are accounts and edges are friendships. Although we could use drawings to represent this graph,

34
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,920
the graph itself is the abstract set of accounts and friendships, completely distinct from the

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,300
drawing. All sorts of things are undrawn graphs, the set of English words considered connected

36
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,440
when they differ by one letter, mathematicians considered connected if they've written a paper

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,640
together, neurons connected by synapses. Or, maybe, for those of us reasoning about the actual drawing

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,720
of a graph on the plane, we can take the set of faces this graph cuts the plane into and consider

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,440
two of them connected if they share an edge. In other words, if you can draw a graph on the plane

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,820
without intersecting edges, you automatically get a second, as of yet undrawn, graph whose vertices

41
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:55,360
are the faces and whose edges are, well, edges of the original graph. We call this the dual of the

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,980
original graph. If you want to represent the dual graph with dots and lines, first put a dot inside

43
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,380
each one of the faces. I personally like to visualize the dot for that outer region as being

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,420
a point somewhere at infinity where you can travel in any direction to get there. Next, connect these

45
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,460
new dots with new lines that pass through the centers of the old lines, where lines connected

46
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,400
to that point at infinity can go off the screen in any direction, as long as it's understood that

47
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,040
they all meet up at the same one point. But keep in mind, this is just the drawing of the dual graph,

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,900
just like the representation of Facebook accounts and friendships with dots and lines is just a

49
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,480
drawing of the social graph. The dual graph itself is the collection of faces and edges. The reason

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,740
I stress this point is to emphasize that edges of the original graph and edges of the dual graph are

51
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,440
not just related, they're the same thing. You see, what makes the dual graph all kinds of awesome is

52
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,060
the many ways that it relates to the original graph. For example, cycles in the original graph

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,880
correspond to connected components of the dual graph, and likewise, cycles in the dual graph

54
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,080
correspond with connected components in the original graph. Now for the cool part. Suppose

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,520
our friend Randolph has an alter ego, Mortimer, living in the dual graph, traveling from face to

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,380
face instead of from vertex to vertex, passing over edges as he does so. Let's say Randolph has

57
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,460
bought all the edges of a spanning tree and that Mortimer is forbidden from crossing those edges.

58
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:33,720
It turns out the edges that Mortimer has available to him are guaranteed to form a spanning tree of

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,000
the dual graph. To see why, we only need to check the two defining properties of spanning trees.

60
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:50,040
They must give Mortimer access to all faces and there can be no cycles. The reason he still has

61
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,680
access to all faces is that it would take a cycle in Randolph's spanning tree to insulate him from

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,740
a face, but trees cannot have cycles. The reason Mortimer cannot traverse a cycle in the dual graph

63
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,020
feels completely symmetric. If he could, he would separate one set of Randolph's vertices from the

64
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:18,740
rest so the spanning tree from which he is banned could not have spanned the whole graph. So not

65
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,940
only does the planar graph have a dual graph, any spanning tree within that graph always has a dual

66
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,920
spanning tree in the dual graph. Here's the kicker. The number of vertices in any tree is always one

67
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,400
more than the number of edges. To see this, note that after you start with the root vertex, each

68
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,820
new edge gives exactly one new vertex. Alternatively, within our narrative, you could think of Randolph

69
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,760
as starting with one vertex and gaining exactly one more for each edge that he buys in what will

70
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,960
become a spanning tree. Since this tree covers all vertices in our graph, the number of vertices is

71
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,680
one more than the number of edges owned by Randolph. Moreover, since the remaining edges make

72
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,120
up a spanning tree for Mortimer's dual graph, the number of edges he gets is one more than the number

73
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,800
of vertices in the dual graph, which are faces of the original graph. Putting this together, it means

74
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,240
the total number of edges is two more than the number of vertices plus the number of faces, which

75
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
is exactly what Euler's formula states.
