1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,455
Take 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 and continue on and 

2
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:10,920
on adding the next power of 2 up to infinity.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,460
This might seem crazy, but there's a sense in which this infinite sum equals negative 1.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,513
If you're like me, this feels strange or obviously false when you first see it, 

5
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:25,660
but I promise you, by the end of this video you and I will make it make sense.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,986
To do this, we need to back up, and you and I will walk through what it 

7
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,840
might feel like to discover convergent infinite sums, 

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,963
those ones that at least seem to make sense, to define what they really mean, 

9
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:40,769
then to discover this crazy equation and stumble upon new forms of math 

10
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:41,880
where it makes sense.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,959
Imagine that you are an early mathematician in the process of discovering 

12
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:53,450
that ½ plus 1 fourth plus 1 eighth plus 1 sixteenth on and on up to infinity, 

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,882
whatever that means, equals 1, and imagine that you needed to define what it 

14
00:00:57,882 --> 00:01:02,200
means to add infinitely many things for your friends to take you seriously.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,840
What would that feel like?

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,645
Frankly, I have no idea, and I imagine that more than anything it 

17
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:10,074
feels like being wrong or stuck most of the time, 

18
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:13,960
but I'll give my best guess at one way that the successful parts of it might go.

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,242
One day, you are pondering the nature of distances between objects, 

20
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:21,576
and how no matter how close two things are, it seems that they can 

21
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:24,760
always be brought a little bit closer together without touching.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,687
Fond of math as you are, you want to capture this paradoxical feeling with numbers, 

23
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:33,373
so you imagine placing the two objects on the number line, the first at 0, 

24
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,160
the second at 1.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,035
Then, you march the first object towards the second, 

26
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:41,620
such that with each step, the distance between them is cut in half.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,362
You keep track of the numbers this object touches during its march, 

28
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:53,020
writing down ½, ½ plus a fourth, ½ plus a fourth plus an eighth, and so on.

29
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,340
That is, each number is naturally written as a 

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,380
slightly longer sum with one more power of 2 in it.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,668
As such, you're tempted to say that if these numbers approach anything, 

32
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:08,135
we should be able to write this thing down as a sum that contains the reciprocal of 

33
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,039
every power of 2.

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,329
On the other hand, we can see geometrically that these numbers approach 1, 

35
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:19,520
so what you want to say is that 1 and some kind of infinite sum are the same thing.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,160
If your education was too formal, you'd write the statement off as ridiculous.

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,700
Clearly, you can't add infinitely many things.

38
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,600
No human, computer, or physical thing ever could perform such a task.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,032
If, however, you approach math with a healthy irreverence, 

40
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:37,657
you'll stand brave in the face of ridiculousness and try to make sense 

41
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:42,100
out of this nonsense you wrote down, since it kind of feels like nature gave it to you.

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,560
So how exactly do you, dear mathematician, go about defining infinite sums?

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,690
Well practiced in math that you are, you know that finding the right 

44
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,456
definitions is less about generating new thoughts than it is about dissecting 

45
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,980
old thoughts, so you go back to how you came across this fuzzy discovery.

46
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,300
At no point did you actually perform infinitely many operations.

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,880
You had a list of numbers, a list that could keep going forever if you had the time, 

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,240
and each number came from a perfectly reasonable finite sum.

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,600
You noticed that the numbers in this list approach 1, but what do you mean by approach?

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,684
It's not just that the distance between each number and 1 gets smaller, 

51
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:29,040
because for that matter, the distance between each number and 2 also gets smaller.

52
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,702
After thinking about it, you realize what makes 1 special is that your numbers can get 

53
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:39,648
arbitrarily close to 1, which is to say, no matter how small your desired distance, 

54
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,653
1 one-hundredth, 1 one-millionth, or 1 over the largest number you could write down, 

55
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:49,835
if you go down your list long enough, the numbers will eventually fall within that tiny 

56
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:50,660
distance of 1.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,767
Retrospectively, this might seem like the clear way to solidify what you mean 

58
00:03:56,767 --> 00:04:00,120
by approach, but as a first-time endeavor, it's actually incredibly clever.

59
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,934
Now you pull out your pin, and scribble down the definition for 

60
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:08,340
what it means for an infinite sum to equal some number, say x.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,248
It means that when you generate a list of numbers by cutting off your 

62
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:17,436
sum at finite points, the numbers in this list approach x in the sense 

63
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:22,096
that no matter how small the distance you choose, at some point down the list, 

64
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,400
all the numbers start falling within that distance of x.

65
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,325
In doing this, you just invented some math, but it never felt like 

66
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:33,686
you were pulling things out of thin air, you were just trying to 

67
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:37,100
justify what it was that the universe gave you in the first place.

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,292
You might wonder if you can find other, more general 

69
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,800
truths about these infinite sums that you just invented.

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,760
To do so, you look for where you made any arbitrary decisions.

71
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,669
For instance, when you were shrinking the distance between your objects, 

72
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,813
cutting the interval into pieces of size ½, ¼, etc., 

73
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,660
you could have chosen a proportion other than ½.

74
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,945
You could have instead cut your interval into pieces of size 9 tenths and 1 tenth, 

75
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:08,329
and then cut that rightmost piece into the same proportions, 

76
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:12,435
giving you smaller pieces of size 9 one hundredths and one one hundredth, 

77
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,820
then cut that tiny piece of size one one hundredth similarly.

78
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,178
Continuing on and on, you'd see that 9 tenths plus 9 one 

79
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:24,727
hundredths plus 9 one thousandths on and on up to infinity equals 1, 

80
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:28,420
a fact more popularly written as 0.9 repeating equals 1.

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,231
To all of your friends who insist that this doesn't equal 1 and it just approaches it, 

82
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:36,411
you can now just smile, because you know that with infinite sums, 

83
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:38,580
to approach and to equal mean the same thing.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,645
To be general about it, let's say that you cut your interval into 

85
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:49,320
pieces of size p and 1-p, where p represents any number between 0 and 1.

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,049
Cutting the piece of size p in similar proportions, 

87
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,780
we now get pieces of size p times 1-p and p squared.

88
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,373
Continuing in this fashion, always cutting up the rightmost piece into 

89
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:09,381
those same proportions, you'll find that 1-p plus p times 1-p plus p 

90
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:15,260
squared times 1-p on and on always adding p to the next power times 1-p equals 1.

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,740
Dividing both sides by 1-p, we get this nice formula.

92
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,520
In this formula, the universe has offered a weird form of nonsense.

93
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,285
Even though the way you discovered it only makes sense for values of p between 0 and 1, 

94
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:37,418
the right hand side still makes sense when you replace p with any other number, 

95
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:38,400
except maybe for 1.

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,103
For instance, plugging in negative 1, the equation reads 1 minus 1 plus 

97
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:52,273
1 minus 1 on and on forever alternating between the two, equals one half, 

98
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:57,860
which feels both silly and kind of like the only thing it could be.

99
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,806
Plugging in 2, the equation reads 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 on and on to 

100
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:10,320
infinity equals negative 1, something which doesn't even seem reasonable.

101
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,087
On the one hand, Rigger would dictate that you ignore these, 

102
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:17,260
since the definition of infinite sums doesn't apply in these cases.

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,308
The list of numbers that you generate by cutting off 

104
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:22,780
the sum at finite points doesn't approach anything.

105
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,704
But you're a mathematician, not a robot, so you don't 

106
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,560
let the fact that something is nonsensical stop you.

107
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,320
I will leave this sum for another day, so that we can jump directly into this monster.

108
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,620
First, to clean things up, notice what you get when you cut off the sum at finite points.

109
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,860
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, they're all 1 less than a power of 2.

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,151
In general, when you add up the first n powers of 2, 

111
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:04,260
you get 2 to the n plus 1 minus 1, which this animation hopefully makes clear.

112
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,652
You decide to humor the universe and pretend that these numbers, 

113
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:27,080
all 1 less than a power of 2, actually do approach negative 1.

114
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,515
It will prove to be cleaner if we add 1 to everything 

115
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:33,059
and say that the powers of 2 approach 0.

116
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,520
Is there any way that this can make sense?

117
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,277
In effect, what you're trying to do is make this formula more general, 

118
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:46,120
by saying that it applies to all numbers, not just those between 0 and 1.

119
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,437
Again, to make things more general, you look for 

120
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:51,860
any place where you made an arbitrary choice.

121
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,923
Here, that place turns out to be very sneaky, so sneaky in fact 

122
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:59,860
that it took mathematicians until the 20th century to find it.

123
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
It's the way that we define distance between two rational numbers.

124
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,890
That is to say, organizing them on a line might 

125
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,000
not be the only reasonable way to organize them.

126
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,958
The notion of distance is essentially a function that takes in 

127
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,680
two numbers and outputs a number indicating how far apart they are.

128
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,770
You could come up with a completely random notion of distance, 

129
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,452
where 2 is 7 away from 3, and ½ is 4 fifths away from 100, and all sorts of things, 

130
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:36,464
but if you want to actually use a new distance function the way you use 

131
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:40,700
the familiar distance function, it should share some of the same properties.

132
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,100
For example, the distance between two numbers shouldn't 

133
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,480
change if you shift them both by the same amount.

134
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,091
So 0 and 4 should be the same distance away as 1 and 5, or 2 and 6, 

135
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:57,920
even if that same distance is something other than 4 as we're used to.

136
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Keeping things general, the distance between two numbers 

137
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,540
shouldn't change if you add the same amount to both of them.

138
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,240
Let's call this property shift invariance.

139
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:16,642
There are other properties that you want your notion of distance to have as well, 

140
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:22,948
like the notion of distance could possibly make powers of 2 approach 0, 

141
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:24,700
and shift invariant.

142
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,496
At first you might toil for a while to find a frame of mind where this doesn't 

143
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,337
feel like utter nonsense, but with enough time and a bit of luck, 

144
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:39,400
you might think to organize your numbers into rooms, subrooms, sub-subrooms, and so on.

145
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,697
You think of 0 as being in the same room as all of the powers of 2 greater than 1, 

146
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:50,095
as being in the same sub-room as all powers of 2 greater than 2, 

147
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:54,494
as being in the same sub-sub-room as powers of 2 greater than 4, 

148
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:58,420
and so on, with infinitely many smaller and smaller rooms.

149
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,140
It's pretty hard to draw infinitely many things, so I'm only going to draw 4 room sizes, 

150
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,180
but keep in the back of your mind that this process should be able to go on forever.

151
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,793
If we think of every number as lying in a hierarchy of rooms, not just 0, 

152
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:17,460
shift invariance will tell us where all of the numbers must fall.

153
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,280
For instance, 1 should be as far away from 3 as 2 is from 0.

154
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,578
Likewise, the distance between 0 and 4 should be the same as that between 1 and 5, 

155
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,960
2 and 6, and 3 and 7.

156
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,815
Continuing like this, you'll see which rooms, sub-rooms, 

157
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:39,580
sub-sub-rooms, and so on, successive numbers must fall into.

158
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,900
You can also deduce where negative numbers must fall.

159
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,480
For example, negative 1 has to be in the same room as 1, in the same sub-room as 3, 

160
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,566
in the same sub-sub-room as 7, and so on, always in smaller and smaller rooms with 

161
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:05,800
numbers 1 less than a power of 2, because 0 is in smaller and smaller rooms with the 

162
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,680
powers of 2.

163
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,099
So, how do you turn this general idea of closeness based 

164
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,400
on rooms and sub-rooms into an actual distance function?

165
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,490
You can't take this drawing too literally, since it makes 1 

166
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,516
look very close to 14 and 0 very far from 13, even though 

167
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:24,960
shift invariance should imply that they're the same distance away.

168
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,825
Again, in the actual process of discovery, you might toil away, 

169
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:33,675
scribbling through many sheets of paper, but if you have the idea that the 

170
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:37,320
only thing which should matter in determining the distance between two 

171
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,940
objects is the size of the smallest room they share, you might come up with the following.

172
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,220
Any numbers lying in different large yellow rooms are a distance 1 from each other.

173
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,253
Those which are in the same large room, but not in the 

174
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:57,900
same orange sub-room are a distance ½ from each other.

175
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,928
And those that are in the same orange sub-room, 

176
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:07,560
but not in the same sub-sub-room are a distance ¼ from each other.

177
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,887
And you continue like this, using the reciprocals of 

178
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:15,780
larger and larger powers of 2 to indicate closeness.

179
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,388
We won't do it in this video, but see if you can reason about 

180
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:25,460
which rooms other rational numbers, like ⅓ and ½, should fall into.

181
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,294
And see if you can prove why this notion of distance satisfies many of the nice 

182
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:34,260
properties we expect from a distance function, like the triangle inequality.

183
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,106
Here, I'll just say that this notion of distance is a perfectly legitimate one, 

184
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:44,096
we call it the 2-adic metric, and it falls into a general family of distance 

185
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:47,880
functions called the p-adic metrics, where p stands for any prime number.

186
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,818
These metrics give rise to a completely new type of number, 

187
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:56,160
neither real nor complex, and have become a central notion in modern number theory.

188
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,644
Using the 2-adic metric, the fact that the sum of all powers 

189
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:07,219
of 2 equals negative 1 actually makes sense, because the numbers 1, 

190
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:10,920
3, 7, 15, 31, and so on, genuinely approach negative 1.

191
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,437
This parable does not actually portray the historical trajectory of discoveries, 

192
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:19,497
but nevertheless, I still think it's a good illustration of a 

193
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:21,620
recurring pattern in the discovery of math.

194
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,500
First, nature hands you something that's ill-defined or even nonsensical.

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,285
Then you define new concepts that make this fuzzy discovery make sense, 

196
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:35,883
and these new concepts tend to yield genuinely useful math and broaden your mind about 

197
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:36,940
traditional notions.

198
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,787
So, in answer to the age-old question of whether math is invention or discovery, 

199
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:45,319
my personal belief is that discovery of non-rigorous truths is what 

200
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,643
leads us to the construction of rigorous terms that are useful, 

201
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:52,020
opening the door for more fuzzy discoveries continuing the cycle.
