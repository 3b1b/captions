1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,920
Take 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 and continue on and on adding the next power of 2 up to infinity.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,000
This might seem crazy, but there's a sense in which this infinite sum equals negative

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,460
1.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,940
If you're like me, this feels strange or obviously false when you first see it, but

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,660
I promise you, by the end of this video you and I will make it make sense.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,520
To do this, we need to back up, and you and I will walk through what it might feel like

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,040
to discover convergent infinite sums, those ones that at least seem to make sense, to

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,060
define what they really mean, then to discover this crazy equation and stumble upon new forms

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,880
of math where it makes sense.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,420
Imagine that you are an early mathematician in the process of discovering that ½ plus

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,120
1 fourth plus 1 eighth plus 1 sixteenth on and on up to infinity, whatever that means,

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,360
equals 1, and imagine that you needed to define what it means to add infinitely many things

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,200
for your friends to take you seriously.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,840
What would that feel like?

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,560
Frankly, I have no idea, and I imagine that more than anything it feels like being wrong

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,900
or stuck most of the time, but I'll give my best guess at one way that the successful

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,960
parts of it might go.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,160
One day, you are pondering the nature of distances between objects, and how no matter how close

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,300
two things are, it seems that they can always be brought a little bit closer together without

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,760
touching.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,880
Fond of math as you are, you want to capture this paradoxical feeling with numbers, so

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,940
you imagine placing the two objects on the number line, the first at 0, the second at

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,160
1.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,300
Then, you march the first object towards the second, such that with each step, the distance

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,620
between them is cut in half.

26
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,620
You keep track of the numbers this object touches during its march, writing down ½,

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,020
½ plus a fourth, ½ plus a fourth plus an eighth, and so on.

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,460
That is, each number is naturally written as a slightly longer sum with one more power

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,380
of 2 in it.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,480
As such, you're tempted to say that if these numbers approach anything, we should be able

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,040
to write this thing down as a sum that contains the reciprocal of every power of 2.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,340
On the other hand, we can see geometrically that these numbers approach 1, so what you

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,520
want to say is that 1 and some kind of infinite sum are the same thing.

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,160
If your education was too formal, you'd write the statement off as ridiculous.

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,700
Clearly, you can't add infinitely many things.

36
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,600
No human, computer, or physical thing ever could perform such a task.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,780
If, however, you approach math with a healthy irreverence, you'll stand brave in the face

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,100
of ridiculousness and try to make sense out of this nonsense you wrote down, since it

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
kind of feels like nature gave it to you.

40
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,560
So how exactly do you, dear mathematician, go about defining infinite sums?

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,460
Well practiced in math that you are, you know that finding the right definitions is less

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,020
about generating new thoughts than it is about dissecting old thoughts, so you go back to

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,980
how you came across this fuzzy discovery.

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,300
At no point did you actually perform infinitely many operations.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,140
You had a list of numbers, a list that could keep going forever if you had the time, and

46
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,240
each number came from a perfectly reasonable finite sum.

47
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,600
You noticed that the numbers in this list approach 1, but what do you mean by approach?

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,700
It's not just that the distance between each number and 1 gets smaller, because for that

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,040
matter, the distance between each number and 2 also gets smaller.

50
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,460
After thinking about it, you realize what makes 1 special is that your numbers can get

51
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:40,180
arbitrarily close to 1, which is to say, no matter how small your desired distance, 1

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,940
one-hundredth, 1 one-millionth, or 1 over the largest number you could write down, if

53
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,760
you go down your list long enough, the numbers will eventually fall within that tiny distance

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,660
of 1.

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,840
Retrospectively, this might seem like the clear way to solidify what you mean by approach,

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,120
but as a first-time endeavor, it's actually incredibly clever.

57
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,740
Now you pull out your pin, and scribble down the definition for what it means for an infinite

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,340
sum to equal some number, say x.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,460
It means that when you generate a list of numbers by cutting off your sum at finite

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:19,720
points, the numbers in this list approach x in the sense that no matter how small the

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,960
distance you choose, at some point down the list, all the numbers start falling within

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
that distance of x.

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,600
In doing this, you just invented some math, but it never felt like you were pulling things

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,220
out of thin air, you were just trying to justify what it was that the universe gave you in

65
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,100
the first place.

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,040
You might wonder if you can find other, more general truths about these infinite sums that

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,800
you just invented.

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,760
To do so, you look for where you made any arbitrary decisions.

69
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,480
For instance, when you were shrinking the distance between your objects, cutting the

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,340
interval into pieces of size ½, ¼, etc., you could have chosen a proportion other than

71
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,660
½.

72
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,420
You could have instead cut your interval into pieces of size 9 tenths and 1 tenth, and then

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,400
cut that rightmost piece into the same proportions, giving you smaller pieces of size 9 one hundredths

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,820
and one one hundredth, then cut that tiny piece of size one one hundredth similarly.

75
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,040
Continuing on and on, you'd see that 9 tenths plus 9 one hundredths plus 9 one thousandths

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,040
on and on up to infinity equals 1, a fact more popularly written as 0.9 repeating equals

77
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,420
1.

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,640
To all of your friends who insist that this doesn't equal 1 and it just approaches it,

79
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,180
you can now just smile, because you know that with infinite sums, to approach and to equal

80
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,580
mean the same thing.

81
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,060
To be general about it, let's say that you cut your interval into pieces of size p and

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,320
1-p, where p represents any number between 0 and 1.

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,120
Cutting the piece of size p in similar proportions, we now get pieces of size p times 1-p and

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,780
p squared.

85
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,600
Continuing in this fashion, always cutting up the rightmost piece into those same proportions,

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,700
you'll find that 1-p plus p times 1-p plus p squared times 1-p on and on always adding

87
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,260
p to the next power times 1-p equals 1.

88
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,740
Dividing both sides by 1-p, we get this nice formula.

89
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,520
In this formula, the universe has offered a weird form of nonsense.

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Even though the way you discovered it only makes sense for values of p between 0 and

91
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,620
1, the right hand side still makes sense when you replace p with any other number, except

92
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,400
maybe for 1.

93
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:48,360
For instance, plugging in negative 1, the equation reads 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 on

94
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,240
and on forever alternating between the two, equals one half, which feels both silly and

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,860
kind of like the only thing it could be.

96
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,060
Plugging in 2, the equation reads 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 on and on to infinity equals

97
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,320
negative 1, something which doesn't even seem reasonable.

98
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,040
On the one hand, Rigger would dictate that you ignore these, since the definition of

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,260
infinite sums doesn't apply in these cases.

100
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,140
The list of numbers that you generate by cutting off the sum at finite points doesn't approach

101
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,780
anything.

102
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,160
But you're a mathematician, not a robot, so you don't let the fact that something

103
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,560
is nonsensical stop you.

104
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,320
I will leave this sum for another day, so that we can jump directly into this monster.

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,620
First, to clean things up, notice what you get when you cut off the sum at finite points.

106
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,860
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, they're all 1 less than a power of 2.

107
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,300
In general, when you add up the first n powers of 2, you get 2 to the n plus 1 minus 1, which

108
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,260
this animation hopefully makes clear.

109
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,540
You decide to humor the universe and pretend that these numbers, all 1 less than a power

110
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,080
of 2, actually do approach negative 1.

111
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,500
It will prove to be cleaner if we add 1 to everything and say that the powers of 2 approach

112
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,060
0.

113
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,520
Is there any way that this can make sense?

114
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,940
In effect, what you're trying to do is make this formula more general, by saying that

115
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,120
it applies to all numbers, not just those between 0 and 1.

116
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,360
Again, to make things more general, you look for any place where you made an arbitrary

117
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,860
choice.

118
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,880
Here, that place turns out to be very sneaky, so sneaky in fact that it took mathematicians

119
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,860
until the 20th century to find it.

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
It's the way that we define distance between two rational numbers.

121
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,540
That is to say, organizing them on a line might not be the only reasonable way to organize

122
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,000
them.

123
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,460
The notion of distance is essentially a function that takes in two numbers and outputs a number

124
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,680
indicating how far apart they are.

125
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,220
You could come up with a completely random notion of distance, where 2 is 7 away from

126
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,120
3, and ½ is 4 fifths away from 100, and all sorts of things, but if you want to actually

127
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,400
use a new distance function the way you use the familiar distance function, it should

128
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,700
share some of the same properties.

129
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,580
For example, the distance between two numbers shouldn't change if you shift them both

130
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,480
by the same amount.

131
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,680
So 0 and 4 should be the same distance away as 1 and 5, or 2 and 6, even if that same

132
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,920
distance is something other than 4 as we're used to.

133
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,020
Keeping things general, the distance between two numbers shouldn't change if you add

134
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,540
the same amount to both of them.

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,240
Let's call this property shift invariance.

136
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:17,420
There are other properties that you want your notion of distance to have as well, like the

137
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:24,700
notion of distance could possibly make powers of 2 approach 0, and shift invariant.

138
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,040
At first you might toil for a while to find a frame of mind where this doesn't feel

139
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,980
like utter nonsense, but with enough time and a bit of luck, you might think to organize

140
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,400
your numbers into rooms, subrooms, sub-subrooms, and so on.

141
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,740
You think of 0 as being in the same room as all of the powers of 2 greater than 1, as

142
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,380
being in the same sub-room as all powers of 2 greater than 2, as being in the same

143
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,680
sub-sub-room as powers of 2 greater than 4, and so on, with infinitely many smaller and

144
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,420
smaller rooms.

145
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,200
It's pretty hard to draw infinitely many things, so I'm only going to draw 4 room

146
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,180
sizes, but keep in the back of your mind that this process should be able to go on forever.

147
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,260
If we think of every number as lying in a hierarchy of rooms, not just 0, shift invariance

148
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,460
will tell us where all of the numbers must fall.

149
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,280
For instance, 1 should be as far away from 3 as 2 is from 0.

150
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,400
Likewise, the distance between 0 and 4 should be the same as that between 1 and 5, 2 and

151
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,960
6, and 3 and 7.

152
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,140
Continuing like this, you'll see which rooms, sub-rooms, sub-sub-rooms, and so on, successive

153
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,580
numbers must fall into.

154
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,900
You can also deduce where negative numbers must fall.

155
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:55,300
For example, negative 1 has to be in the same room as 1, in the same sub-room as 3, in the

156
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,200
same sub-sub-room as 7, and so on, always in smaller and smaller rooms with numbers

157
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,100
1 less than a power of 2, because 0 is in smaller and smaller rooms with the powers

158
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,680
of 2.

159
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,500
So, how do you turn this general idea of closeness based on rooms and sub-rooms into an actual

160
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,400
distance function?

161
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,900
You can't take this drawing too literally, since it makes 1 look very close to 14 and

162
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,560
0 very far from 13, even though shift invariance should imply that they're the same distance

163
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:24,960
away.

164
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,080
Again, in the actual process of discovery, you might toil away, scribbling through many

165
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,260
sheets of paper, but if you have the idea that the only thing which should matter in

166
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,080
determining the distance between two objects is the size of the smallest room they share,

167
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,940
you might come up with the following.

168
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,220
Any numbers lying in different large yellow rooms are a distance 1 from each other.

169
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,020
Those which are in the same large room, but not in the same orange sub-room are a distance

170
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,900
½ from each other.

171
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,420
And those that are in the same orange sub-room, but not in the same sub-sub-room are a distance

172
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,560
¼ from each other.

173
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,100
And you continue like this, using the reciprocals of larger and larger powers of 2 to indicate

174
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,780
closeness.

175
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,100
We won't do it in this video, but see if you can reason about which rooms other rational

176
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,460
numbers, like ⅓ and ½, should fall into.

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,900
And see if you can prove why this notion of distance satisfies many of the nice properties

178
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,260
we expect from a distance function, like the triangle inequality.

179
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,500
Here, I'll just say that this notion of distance is a perfectly legitimate one, we

180
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,880
call it the 2-adic metric, and it falls into a general family of distance functions called

181
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,880
the p-adic metrics, where p stands for any prime number.

182
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,200
These metrics give rise to a completely new type of number, neither real nor complex,

183
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,160
and have become a central notion in modern number theory.

184
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,820
Using the 2-adic metric, the fact that the sum of all powers of 2 equals negative 1 actually

185
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,500
makes sense, because the numbers 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on, genuinely approach negative

186
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,920
1.

187
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,760
This parable does not actually portray the historical trajectory of discoveries, but

188
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,740
nevertheless, I still think it's a good illustration of a recurring pattern in the

189
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,620
discovery of math.

190
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,500
First, nature hands you something that's ill-defined or even nonsensical.

191
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,100
Then you define new concepts that make this fuzzy discovery make sense, and these new

192
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,940
concepts tend to yield genuinely useful math and broaden your mind about traditional notions.

193
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,640
So, in answer to the age-old question of whether math is invention or discovery, my personal

194
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,600
belief is that discovery of non-rigorous truths is what leads us to the construction of rigorous

195
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,320
terms that are useful, opening the door for more fuzzy discoveries continuing the cycle.
