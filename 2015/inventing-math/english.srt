1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Take 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 and continue on and on adding the next power of 2 up to infinity.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,360
This might seem crazy, but there's a sense in which this infinite sum equals negative

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
1.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,960
If you're like me, this feels strange or obviously false when you first see it, but

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,640
I promise you, by the end of this video you and I will make it make sense.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,580
To do this, we need to back up, and you and I will walk through what it might feel like

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,080
to discover convergent infinite sums, those ones that at least seem to make sense, to

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,060
define what they really mean, then to discover this crazy equation and stumble upon new forms

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,840
of math where it makes sense.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,400
Imagine that you are an early mathematician in the process of discovering that ½ plus

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,840
1 fourth plus 1 eighth plus 1 sixteenth on and on up to infinity, whatever that means,

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,720
equals 1, and imagine that you needed to define what it means to add infinitely many things

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,000
for your friends to take you seriously.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What would that feel like?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,640
Frankly, I have no idea, and I imagine that more than anything it feels like being wrong

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,940
or stuck most of the time, but I'll give my best guess at one way that the successful

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,280
parts of it might go.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,140
One day you are pondering the nature of distances between objects, and how no matter how close

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,560
two things are, it seems that they can always be brought a little bit closer together without

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
touching.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,840
Fond of math as you are, you want to capture this paradoxical feeling with numbers, so

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,120
you imagine placing the two objects on the number line, the first at 0, the second at

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
1.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,280
Then, you march the first object towards the second, such that with each step the distance

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,600
between them is cut in half.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,720
We keep track of the numbers this object touches during its march, writing down ½, ½ plus

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,640
a fourth, ½ plus a fourth plus an eighth, and so on.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,420
That is, each number is naturally written as a slightly longer sum with one more power

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,980
of 2 in it.

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,480
As such, you're tempted to say that if these numbers approach anything, we should be able

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,880
to write this thing down as a sum that contains the reciprocal of every power of 2.

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,200
On the other hand, we can see geometrically that these numbers approach 1, so what you

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,840
want to say is that 1 and some kind of infinite sum are the same thing.

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,440
If your education was too formal, you'd write the statement off as ridiculous.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,120
Clearly, you can't add infinitely many things.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
No human, computer, or physical thing ever could perform such a task.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,780
If however, you approach math with a healthy irreverence, you'll stand brave in the face

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,080
of ridiculousness and try to make sense out of this nonsense you wrote down, since it

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,620
kind of feels like nature gave it to you.

40
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,580
So how exactly do you, dear mathematician, go about defining infinite sums?

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,440
Well practiced in math that you are, you know that finding the right definitions is less

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,940
about generating new thoughts than it is about dissecting old thoughts, so you go back to

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,940
how you came across this fuzzy discovery.

44
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,580
At no point did you actually perform infinitely many operations.

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,180
You had a list of numbers, a list that could keep going forever if you had the time, and

46
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,340
each number came from a perfectly reasonable finite sum.

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,340
You noticed that the numbers in this list approach 1, but what do you mean by approach?

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,740
It's not just that the distance between each number and 1 gets smaller, because for that

49
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,060
matter, the distance between each number and 2 also gets smaller.

50
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,420
After thinking about it, you realize what makes 1 special is that your numbers can get

51
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,180
arbitrarily close to 1, which is to say, no matter how small your desired distance,

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,900
one one hundredth, one one millionth, or one over the largest number you could write down,

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,200
if you go down your list long enough, the numbers will eventually fall within that tiny

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,060
tiny distance of 1.

55
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,380
Retrospectively this might seem like the clear way to solidify what you mean by approach,

56
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,820
but as a first time endeavor, it's actually incredibly clever.

57
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,760
Now you pull out your pin, and scribble down the definition for what it means for an infinite

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,100
sum to equal some number, say x.

59
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,500
It means that when you generate a list of numbers by cutting off your sum at finite

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,680
points, the numbers in this list approach x in the sense that no matter how small the

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,060
distance you choose, at some point down the list, all the numbers start falling within

62
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,940
that distance of x.

63
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,580
In doing this, you just invented some math, but it never felt like you were pulling things

64
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,000
out of thin air.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,100
You were just trying to justify what it was that the universe gave you in the first place.

66
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,000
You might wonder if you can find other, more general truths about these infinite sums that

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
you just invented.

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,480
To do so, you look for where you made any arbitrary decisions.

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,400
For instance, when you were shrinking the distance between your objects, cutting the

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,900
interval into pieces of size one half, one fourth, etc., you could have chosen a proportion

71
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,380
other than one half.

72
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,260
You could have instead cut your interval into pieces of size nine tenths and one tenth,

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,740
and then cut that rightmost piece into the same proportions, giving you smaller pieces

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,380
of size nine one hundredths and one one hundredth, then cut that tiny piece of size one one hundredth

75
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,380
similarly.

76
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,060
Continuing on and on, you'd see that nine tenths plus nine one hundredths plus nine

77
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,960
one thousandths on and on up to infinity equals one, a fact more popularly written as point

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,140
nine repeating equals one.

79
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,540
To all of your friends who insist that this doesn't equal one and it just approaches

80
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,820
it, you can now just smile, because you know that with infinite sums, to approach and to

81
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,820
equal mean the same thing.

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,300
To be general about it, let's say that you cut your interval into pieces of size p and

83
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,300
one minus p, where p represents any number between zero and one.

84
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,340
Cutting the piece of size p in similar proportions, we now get pieces of size p times one minus

85
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,620
p and p squared.

86
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,020
Continuing in this fashion, always cutting up the rightmost piece into those same proportions,

87
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,820
you'll find that one minus p plus p times one minus p plus p squared times one minus

88
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:16,660
p, on and on always adding p to the next power times one minus p, equals one.

89
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:24,180
Dividing both sides by one minus p, we get this nice formula.

90
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,940
In this formula, the universe has offered a weird form of nonsense.

91
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,700
Even though the way you discovered it only makes sense for values of p between zero and

92
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,460
one, the right hand side still makes sense when you replace p with any other number,

93
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,820
except maybe for one.

94
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,400
For instance, plugging in negative one, the equation reads one minus one plus one minus

95
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,200
one, on and on forever alternating between the two, equals one half, which feels pretty

96
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,800
silly and kind of like the only thing it could be.

97
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Plugging in two, the equation reads one plus two plus four plus eight, on and on to infinity,

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,240
equals negative one, something which doesn't even seem reasonable.

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,960
On the one hand, Rigger would dictate that you ignore these, since the definition of

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,800
infinite sums doesn't apply in these cases.

101
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,060
The list of numbers you generate by cutting off the sum at finite points doesn't approach

102
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:31,220
anything.

103
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,160
But you're a mathematician, not a robot, so you don't let the fact that something

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,280
is nonsensical stop you.

105
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,840
I will leave this sum for another day, so that we can jump directly into this monster.

106
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,920
First, to clean things up, notice what you get when you cut off the sum at finite points.

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,760
One, three, seven, fifteen, thirty-one, they're all one less than a power of two.

108
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,280
In general, when you add up the first n powers of two, you get two to the n plus one minus

109
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:20,640
one, which this animation hopefully makes clear.

110
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,480
You decide to humor the universe and pretend that these numbers, all one less than a power

111
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,640
of two, actually do approach negative one.

112
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,160
It will prove to be cleaner if we add one to everything and say that the powers of two

113
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,720
approach zero.

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,640
Is there any way that this can make sense?

115
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,920
In effect, what you're trying to do is make this formula more general, by saying that

116
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,840
it applies to all numbers, not just those between zero and one.

117
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,520
Again, to make things more general, you look for any place where you made an arbitrary

118
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
choice.

119
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,680
Here, that place turns out to be very sneaky.

120
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,680
So sneaky, in fact, that it took mathematicians until the 20th century to find it.

121
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,840
It's the way that we define distance between two rational numbers.

122
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,760
That is to say, organizing them on a line might not be the only reasonable way to organize

123
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,700
them.

124
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,540
The notion of distance is essentially a function that takes in two numbers and outputs a number

125
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,700
indicating how far apart they are.

126
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,980
You could come up with a completely random notion of distance, where two is seven away

127
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,820
from three, and one half is four fifths away from a hundred, and all sorts of things.

128
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,900
But if you want to actually use a new distance function the way that you use the familiar

129
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,420
distance function, it should share some of the same properties.

130
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,700
For example, the distance between two numbers shouldn't change if you shift them both by

131
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,880
the same amount.

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,060
So zero and four should be the same distance away as one and five, or two and six, even

133
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,160
if that same distance is something other than four as we're used to.

134
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,000
Keeping things general, the distance between two numbers shouldn't change if you add

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
the same amount to both of them.

136
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,760
Let's call this property shift invariance.

137
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
There are other properties that you want your notion of distance to have as well, like the

138
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,160
triangle inequality, but before we start worrying about those, let's start imagining what

139
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:26,120
notion of distance could possibly make powers of two approach zero, and which is shift invariant.

140
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,980
At first you might toil for a while to find a frame of mind where this doesn't feel

141
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,980
like utter nonsense, but with enough time and a bit of luck you might think to organize

142
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,220
your numbers into rooms, subrooms, sub-subrooms, and so on.

143
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,680
You think of zero as being in the same room as all of the powers of two greater than one.

144
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,520
As being in the same sub-room as all powers of two greater than two.

145
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,360
As being in the same sub-sub-room as powers of two greater than four, and so on, with

146
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,240
infinitely many smaller and smaller rooms.

147
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,040
It's pretty hard to draw infinitely many things, so I'm only going to draw four room sizes,

148
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,060
but keep in the back of your mind that this process should be able to go on forever.

149
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,240
If we think of every number as lying in a hierarchy of rooms, not just zero, shift invariance

150
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,320
will tell us where all of the numbers must fall.

151
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,440
For instance, one should be as far away from three as two is from zero.

152
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Likewise, the distance between zero and four should be the same as that between one and

153
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,640
five, two and six, and three and seven.

154
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,180
Continuing like this, you'll see which rooms, sub-rooms, sub-sub-rooms, and so on, successive

155
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,560
numbers must fall into.

156
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,380
You can also deduce where negative numbers must fall.

157
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,960
For example, negative one has to be in the same room as one, in the same sub-room as

158
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,600
three, the same sub-sub-room as seven, and so on, always in smaller and smaller rooms

159
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,520
with numbers one less than a power of two, because zero is in smaller and smaller rooms

160
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,200
with the powers of two.

161
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,600
So how do you turn this general idea of closeness based on rooms and sub-rooms into an actual

162
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,400
distance function?

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,760
You can't take this drawing too literally, since it makes one look very close to fourteen

164
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,880
and zero very far from thirteen, even though shift invariance should imply that they're

165
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,920
the same distance away.

166
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,040
Again, in the actual process of discovery, you might toil away, scribbling through many

167
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,180
sheets of paper, but if you have the idea that the only thing which should matter in

168
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,760
determining the distance between two objects is the size of the smallest room they share,

169
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,380
you might come up with the following.

170
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,800
Three numbers lying in different large yellow rooms are a distance one from each other.

171
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,020
Those which are in the same large room, but not in the same orange sub-room, are a distance

172
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,200
one half from each other.

173
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,420
Those that are in the same orange sub-room, but not in the same sub-sub-room, are a distance

174
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,220
one fourth from each other.

175
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,040
You continue like this, using the reciprocals of larger and larger powers of two to indicate

176
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
closeness.

177
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,100
We won't do it in this video, but see if you can reason about which rooms other rational

178
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,980
numbers like one third and one half should fall into, and see if you can prove why this

179
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,920
notion of distance satisfies many of the nice properties we expect from a distance function,

180
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,340
like the triangle inequality.

181
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,760
Here I'll just say that this notion of distance is a perfectly legitimate one, we call it

182
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,460
the 2-adic metric, and it falls into a general family of distance functions called the p-adic

183
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,840
metric, where p stands for any prime number.

184
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,740
These metrics give rise to a completely new type of number, neither real nor complex,

185
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,780
and have become a central notion in modern number theory.

186
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,340
Using the 2-adic metric, the fact that the sum of all powers of two equals negative one

187
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:10,100
actually makes sense, because the numbers 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on genuinely approach

188
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,560
negative one.

189
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,940
This parable does not actually portray the historical trajectory of discoveries, but

190
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,260
nevertheless I still think it's a good illustration of a recurring pattern in the discovery of

191
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,260
math.

192
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,540
First, nature hands you something that's ill-defined or even nonsensical.

193
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,940
Then you define new concepts that make this fuzzy discovery make sense, and these new

194
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,600
concepts tend to yield genuinely useful math and broaden your mind about traditional notions.

195
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,640
So in answer to the age-old question of whether math is invention or discovery, my personal

196
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,580
belief is that discovery of non-rigorous truths is what leads us to the construction of rigorous

197
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,220
terms that are useful, opening the door for more fuzzy discoveries continuing the cycle.

198
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,940
.
