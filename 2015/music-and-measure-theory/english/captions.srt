1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,420
I have two seemingly unrelated challenges for you.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,514
The first relates to music, and the second gives a foundational result in measure theory, 

3
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:15,730
which is the formal underpinning for how mathematicians define 

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,160
integration and probability.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,554
The second challenge, which I'll get to about halfway through the video, 

6
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,240
has to do with covering numbers with open sets, and is very counterintuitive.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,540
Or at least, when I first saw it, I was confused for a while.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,602
Foremost, I'd like to explain what's going on, 

9
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:35,160
but I also plan to share a surprising connection that it has with music.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,300
Here's the first challenge.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm going to play a musical note with a given frequency, let's say 220 Hz.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,241
Then I'm going to choose some number between 1 and 2, which we'll call R, 

13
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:54,250
and play a second musical note whose frequency is R times the frequency of the first 

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:54,840
note, 220.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,546
For some values of R, like 1.5, the two notes will sound harmonious together, 

16
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:04,580
but for others, like the square root of 2, they sound cacophonous.

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,101
Your task is to determine whether a given ratio R will give a pleasant sound or 

18
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:15,000
an unpleasant one just by analyzing the number, and without listening to the notes.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,935
One way to answer, especially if your name is Pythagoras, 

20
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:24,632
might be to say that two notes sound good together when the ratio is a rational number, 

21
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,180
and bad when it's irrational.

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,580
For instance, a ratio of 3 halves gives a musical fifth.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,980
4 thirds gives a musical fourth.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,160
8 fifths gives a major sixth, so on.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,240
Here's my best guess for why this is the case.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,657
A musical note is made up of beats played in rapid succession, 

27
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,620
for instance 220 beats per second.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,963
When the ratio of frequencies of two notes is rational, 

29
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:56,191
there's a detectable pattern in those beats, which when we slow it down, 

30
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,740
we hear as a rhythm instead of as a harmony.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,060
Evidently, when our brains pick up on this pattern, the two notes sound nice together.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,515
However, most rational numbers actually sound pretty bad, 

33
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:16,480
like 211 over 198, or 1093 divided by 826.

34
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,899
The issue, of course, is that these rational numbers 

35
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:22,340
are somehow more complicated than the other ones.

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,240
Our ears don't pick up on the pattern of the beats.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,333
One simple way to measure complexity of rational numbers is to 

38
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,360
consider the size of the denominator when it's written in reduced form.

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,629
So we might edit our original answer to only admit fractions with low denominators, 

40
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:44,660
say less than 10.

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,703
Even still, this doesn't quite capture harmoniousness, 

42
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,606
since plenty of notes sound good together even when the ratio of their 

43
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:59,060
frequencies is irrational, so long as it's close to a harmonious rational number.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,982
And it's a good thing, too, because many instruments, such as pianos, 

45
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:10,207
are not tuned in terms of rational intervals, but are tuned such that each half-step 

46
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:15,370
increase corresponds with multiplying the original frequency by the 12th root of 2, 

47
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,600
which is irrational.

48
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,853
If you're curious about why this is done, Henry at MinutePhysics 

49
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:23,640
recently did a video that gives a very nice explanation.

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,321
This means that if you take a harmonious interval, like a fifth, 

51
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:34,584
the ratio of frequencies when played on a piano will not be a nice rational number 

52
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:39,529
like you expect, in this case 3 halves, but will instead be some power of the 

53
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:43,968
12th root of 2, in this case 2 to the 7 over 12, which is irrational, 

54
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:45,680
but very close to 3 halves.

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,013
Similarly, a musical fourth corresponds to 2 to the 5 twelfths, 

56
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,960
which is very close to 4 thirds.

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,122
In fact, the reason it works so well to have 12 notes in the chromatic 

58
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:06,620
scale is that powers of the 12th root of 2 have this strange tendency 

59
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,540
to be within a 1% margin of error of simple rational numbers.

60
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,737
So now you might say that a ratio R will produce a harmonious pair of notes if it 

61
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:23,120
is sufficiently close to a rational number with a sufficiently small denominator.

62
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,465
How close depends on how discerning your ear is, 

63
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:30,924
and how small a denominator depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns your 

64
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,900
ear has been trained to pick up on.

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,545
After all, maybe someone with a particularly acute musical sense would be able to 

66
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:43,726
hear and find pleasure in the pattern resulting from more complicated fractions, 

67
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:49,420
like 23 over 21, or 35 over 43, as well as numbers closely approximating those fractions.

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,780
This leads me to an interesting question.

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,928
Suppose there is a musical savant who finds pleasure in all 

70
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:01,109
pairs of notes whose frequencies have a rational ratio, 

71
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:05,200
even the super complicated ratios that you and I would find cacophonous.

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,693
Is it the case that she would find all ratios R between 1 and 2 harmonious, 

73
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:13,060
even the irrational ones?

74
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,023
After all, for any given real number, you can always find a rational number 

75
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:22,860
arbitrarily close to it, just like 3 halves is really close to 2 to the 7 over 12.

76
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,540
Well, this brings us to challenge number 2.

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,130
Mathematicians like to ask riddles about covering various sets with open intervals, 

78
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,420
and the answers to these riddles have a strange tendency to become famous lemmas of 

79
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,880
theorems.

80
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,665
By open interval, I just mean the continuous stretch of real 

81
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:49,545
numbers strictly greater than some number a, but strictly less than some other number b, 

82
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:51,520
where b is of course greater than a.

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,124
My challenge to you involves covering all of the 

84
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:58,180
rational numbers between 0 and 1 with open intervals.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,153
When I say cover, all this means is that each particular 

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,460
rational number lies inside at least one of your intervals.

87
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,724
The most obvious way to do this is to just use the entire interval 

88
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:15,565
from 0 to 1 itself and call it done, but the challenge here is that 

89
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:19,520
the sum of the lengths of your intervals must be strictly less than 1.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,266
To aid you in this seemingly impossible task, 

91
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:29,300
you're allowed to use infinitely many intervals.

92
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,700
Even still, the task might feel impossible, since the rational 

93
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,299
numbers are dense in the real numbers, meaning any stretch, 

94
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:43,080
no matter how small, contains infinitely many rational numbers.

95
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,188
So how could you possibly cover all of the rational numbers without just covering 

96
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:53,476
the entire interval from 0 to 1 itself, which would mean the total length of your 

97
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:57,660
open intervals has to be at least the length of the entire interval from 0 to 1?

98
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,840
Then again, I wouldn't be asking if there wasn't a way to do it.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,448
First, we enumerate the rational numbers between 0 and 1, 

100
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:12,660
meaning we organize them into an infinitely long list.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,395
There are many ways to do this, but one natural way that I'll choose is to start with 1 

102
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:22,248
half, followed by 1 third and 2 thirds, then 1 fourth and 3 fourths, 

103
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:26,102
we don't write down 2 fourths since it's already appeared as 1 half, 

104
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:31,073
then all reduced fractions with denominator 5, all reduced fractions with denominator 6, 

105
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:33,140
continuing on and on in this fashion.

106
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,474
Every fraction will appear exactly once in this list in its reduced form, 

107
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:42,509
and it gives us a meaningful way to talk about the first rational number, 

108
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,380
the second rational number, the 42nd rational number, things like that.

109
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,633
Next, to ensure that each rational is covered, 

110
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:53,000
we're going to assign one specific interval to each rational.

111
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,974
Once we remove the intervals from the geometry of our setup, 

112
00:07:56,974 --> 00:08:01,033
and just think of them in a list, each one responsible for one rational number, 

113
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:04,686
it seems much clearer that the sum of their lengths can be less than 1, 

114
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:07,730
since each particular interval can be as small as you want, 

115
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,760
and still cover its designated rational.

116
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,220
In fact, the sum can be any positive number.

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,253
Just choose an infinite sum with positive terms that converges to 1, 

118
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:21,220
like 1 half plus 1 fourth plus 1 eighth, on and on.

119
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,289
Then choose any desired value of epsilon greater than 0, like 0.5, 

120
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,858
and multiply all of the terms in the sum by epsilon so that you have an infinite sum 

121
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:34,299
converging to epsilon.

122
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,200
Now, scale the nth interval to have a length equal to the nth term in the sum.

123
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,860
Notice, this means your intervals start getting really small really fast, 

124
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,409
so small that you can't really see most of them in this animation, 

125
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:54,860
but it doesn't matter, since each one is only responsible for covering one rational.

126
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,360
I've said it already, but I'll say it again because it's so amazing.

127
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,126
Epsilon can be whatever positive number we want, 

128
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:08,520
so not only can our sum be less than 1, it can be arbitrarily small.

129
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,365
This is one of those results where, even after seeing the proof, 

130
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:15,680
it still defies intuition.

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,192
The discord here is that the proof has us thinking analytically, 

132
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:24,838
with the rational numbers in a list, but our intuition has us thinking geometrically, 

133
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:28,188
with all the rational numbers as a dense set on the interval, 

134
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:32,295
where you can't skip over any continuous stretch because that would contain 

135
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:33,700
infinitely many rationals.

136
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,060
So let's get a visual understanding for what's going on.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,174
Brief side note here, I had trouble deciding on how to illustrate small intervals, 

138
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,789
since if I scale the parentheses with the interval, 

139
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,964
you won't be able to see them at all, but if I just push the parentheses together, 

140
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:53,680
they cross over in a way that's potentially confusing.

141
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,050
Nevertheless, I decided to go with the ugly chromosomal cross, so keep in mind, 

142
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,080
the interval this represents is that tiny stretch between the centers of each parentheses.

143
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,480
Okay, back to the visual intuition.

144
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,015
Consider when epsilon equals 0.3, meaning if I choose a number between 0 and 1 at random, 

145
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:18,240
there's a 70% chance that it's outside those infinitely many intervals.

146
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,320
What does it look like to be outside the intervals?

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,060
The square root of 2 over 2 is among those 70%, and I'm going to zoom in on it.

148
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,180
As I do so, I'll draw the first 10 intervals in our list within our scope of vision.

149
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,266
As we get closer and closer to the square root of 2 over 2, 

150
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:42,263
even though you will always find rationals within your field of view, 

151
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:46,660
the intervals placed on top of those rationals get really small, really fast.

152
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,178
One might say that for any sequence of rational numbers approaching 

153
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:54,763
the square root of 2 over 2, the intervals containing the elements 

154
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,920
of that sequence shrink faster than the sequence converges.

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,900
Notice, intervals are really small if they show up late in the list, 

156
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,900
and rationals show up late in the list when they have large denominators.

157
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,425
So the fact that the square root of 2 over 2 is among the 70% not covered 

158
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:18,140
by our intervals is, in a sense, a way to formalize the otherwise vague 

159
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,920
idea that the only rational numbers close to it have a large denominator.

160
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,920
That is to say, the square root of 2 over 2 is cacophonous.

161
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,884
In fact, let's use a smaller epsilon, say 0.01, 

162
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:45,020
and shift our setup to lie on top of the interval from 1 to 2 instead of from 0 to 1.

163
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,000
Then which numbers fall among that elite 1% covered by our tiny intervals?

164
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,660
Almost all of them are harmonious.

165
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,048
For instance, the harmonious irrational number 2 to the 7 twelfths is very close 

166
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:03,192
to 3 halves, which has a relatively fat interval sitting on top of it, 

167
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:08,037
and the interval around 4 thirds is smaller but still fat enough to cover 2 to the 

168
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:08,680
5 twelfths.

169
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,300
Which members of the 1% are cacophonous?

170
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, the cacophonous rationals, meaning those with high denominators, 

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,180
and irrationals that are very very very close to them.

172
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,920
However, think of the savant who finds harmonic patterns in all rational numbers.

173
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,568
You could imagine that for her, harmonious numbers are precisely 

174
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:35,551
those 1% covered by the intervals, provided that her tolerance 

175
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:39,660
for error goes down exponentially for more complicated rationals.

176
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,751
In other words, the seemingly paradoxical fact that you can have a collection 

177
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:50,108
of intervals densely populate a range while only covering 1% of its values 

178
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:54,640
corresponds to the fact that harmonious numbers are rare, even for the savant.

179
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm not saying this makes the result more intuitive.

180
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,929
In fact, I find it quite surprising that the savant 

181
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,920
I defined could find 99% of all ratios cacophonous.

182
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,360
But the fact that these two ideas are connected was simply too beautiful not to share.
