1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,840
I have two seemingly unrelated challenges for you. The first relates to music, and the

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,420
second gives a foundational result in measure theory, which is the formal underpinning for

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,360
how mathematicians define integration and probability. The second challenge, which I'll

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,520
get to about halfway through the video, has to do with covering numbers with open sets,

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,380
and is very counterintuitive. Or at least, when I first saw it, I was confused for a

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,520
while. Foremost, I'd like to explain what's going on, but I also plan to share a surprising

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,160
connection that it has with music. Here's the first challenge. I'm going to play a musical

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,740
note with a given frequency, let's say 220 Hz. Then I'm going to choose some number between

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,900
1 and 2, which we'll call R, and play a second musical note whose frequency is R times the

10
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,440
frequency of the first note, 220. For some values of R, like 1.5, the two notes will

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,580
sound harmonious together, but for others, like the square root of 2, they sound cacophonous.

12
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:11,020
Your task is to determine whether a given ratio R will give a pleasant sound or an unpleasant

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,780
one just by analyzing the number, and without listening to the notes. One way to answer,

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,120
especially if your name is Pythagoras, might be to say that two notes sound good together

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,140
when the ratio is a rational number, and bad when it's irrational. For instance, a ratio of 3 halves

16
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:38,160
gives a musical fifth. 4 thirds gives a musical fourth. 8 fifths gives a major sixth, so on.

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,720
Here's my best guess for why this is the case. A musical note is made up of beats played in rapid

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,200
succession, for instance 220 beats per second. When the ratio of frequencies of two notes is

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,140
rational, there's a detectable pattern in those beats, which when we slow it down,

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,740
we hear as a rhythm instead of as a harmony. Evidently, when our brains pick up on this

21
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:10,060
pattern, the two notes sound nice together. However, most rational numbers actually sound

22
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:19,520
pretty bad, like 211 over 198, or 1093 divided by 826. The issue, of course, is that these rational

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,580
numbers are somehow more complicated than the other ones. Our ears don't pick up on the pattern

24
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:34,760
of the beats. One simple way to measure complexity of rational numbers is to consider the size of the

25
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,640
denominator when it's written in reduced form. So we might edit our original answer to only admit

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,560
fractions with low denominators, say less than 10. Even still, this doesn't quite capture

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,580
harmoniousness, since plenty of notes sound good together even when the ratio of their frequencies

28
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,620
is irrational, so long as it's close to a harmonious rational number. And it's a good thing,

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,260
too, because many instruments, such as pianos, are not tuned in terms of rational intervals,

30
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,540
but are tuned such that each half-step increase corresponds with multiplying the original frequency

31
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,500
by the 12th root of 2, which is irrational. If you're curious about why this is done,

32
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,140
Henry at MinutePhysics recently did a video that gives a very nice explanation. This means that if

33
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,140
you take a harmonious interval, like a fifth, the ratio of frequencies when played on a piano

34
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,100
will not be a nice rational number like you expect, in this case 3 halves, but will instead

35
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,580
be some power of the 12th root of 2, in this case 2 to the 7 over 12, which is irrational,

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:53,120
but very close to 3 halves. Similarly, a musical fourth corresponds to 2 to the 5 twelfths,

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,540
which is very close to 4 thirds. In fact, the reason it works so well to have 12 notes in the

38
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,300
chromatic scale is that powers of the 12th root of 2 have this strange tendency to be within a

39
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:16,840
1% margin of error of simple rational numbers. So now you might say that a ratio R will produce

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,080
a harmonious pair of notes if it is sufficiently close to a rational number with a sufficiently

41
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,320
small denominator. How close depends on how discerning your ear is, and how small a

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,900
denominator depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns your ear has been trained to pick up on.

43
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,600
After all, maybe someone with a particularly acute musical sense would be able to hear and

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,000
find pleasure in the pattern resulting from more complicated fractions, like 23 over 21,

45
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,420
or 35 over 43, as well as numbers closely approximating those fractions.

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,780
This leads me to an interesting question. Suppose there is a musical savant who finds pleasure in

47
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,800
all pairs of notes whose frequencies have a rational ratio, even the super complicated

48
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,780
ratios that you and I would find cacophonous. Is it the case that she would find all ratios

49
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,660
R between 1 and 2 harmonious, even the irrational ones? After all, for any given real number,

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,420
you can always find a rational number arbitrarily close to it, just like 3 halves is really close

51
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:32,000
to 2 to the 7 over 12. Well, this brings us to challenge number 2. Mathematicians like to ask

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,140
riddles about covering various sets with open intervals, and the answers to these riddles have

53
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:43,800
a strange tendency to become famous lemmas of theorems. By open interval, I just mean the

54
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,540
continuous stretch of real numbers strictly greater than some number a, but strictly less

55
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,060
than some other number b, where b is of course greater than a. My challenge to you involves

56
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,640
covering all of the rational numbers between 0 and 1 with open intervals. When I say cover,

57
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,460
all this means is that each particular rational number lies inside at least one of your intervals.

58
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,820
The most obvious way to do this is to just use the entire interval from 0 to 1 itself and call

59
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,340
it done, but the challenge here is that the sum of the lengths of your intervals must be

60
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:28,440
strictly less than 1. To aid you in this seemingly impossible task, you're allowed to use infinitely

61
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,920
many intervals. Even still, the task might feel impossible, since the rational numbers are dense

62
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,620
in the real numbers, meaning any stretch, no matter how small, contains infinitely many rational

63
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,320
numbers. So how could you possibly cover all of the rational numbers without just covering the

64
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,300
entire interval from 0 to 1 itself, which would mean the total length of your open intervals has

65
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:02,300
to be at least the length of the entire interval from 0 to 1? Then again, I wouldn't be asking if

66
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:10,340
there wasn't a way to do it. First, we enumerate the rational numbers between 0 and 1, meaning we

67
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,020
organize them into an infinitely long list. There are many ways to do this, but one natural way that

68
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,600
I'll choose is to start with 1 half, followed by 1 third and 2 thirds, then 1 fourth and 3 fourths,

69
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,640
we don't write down 2 fourths since it's already appeared as 1 half, then all reduced fractions

70
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,140
with denominator 5, all reduced fractions with denominator 6, continuing on and on in this fashion.

71
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,680
Every fraction will appear exactly once in this list in its reduced form, and it gives us a

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,620
meaningful way to talk about the first rational number, the second rational number, the 42nd rational

73
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,060
number, things like that. Next, to ensure that each rational is covered, we're going to assign one

74
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,920
specific interval to each rational. Once we remove the intervals from the geometry of our setup, and

75
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,920
just think of them in a list, each one responsible for one rational number, it seems much clearer

76
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,320
that the sum of their lengths can be less than 1, since each particular interval can be as small as

77
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,440
you want, and still cover its designated rational. In fact, the sum can be any positive number. Just

78
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,820
choose an infinite sum with positive terms that converges to 1, like 1 half plus 1 fourth plus

79
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:29,220
1 eighth, on and on. Then choose any desired value of epsilon greater than 0, like 0.5, and multiply

80
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,300
all of the terms in the sum by epsilon so that you have an infinite sum converging to epsilon.

81
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:44,200
Now, scale the nth interval to have a length equal to the nth term in the sum. Notice, this means your

82
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,240
intervals start getting really small really fast, so small that you can't really see most of them

83
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,420
in this animation, but it doesn't matter, since each one is only responsible for covering one

84
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:01,960
rational. I've said it already, but I'll say it again because it's so amazing. Epsilon can be

85
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,920
whatever positive number we want, so not only can our sum be less than 1, it can be arbitrarily

86
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,680
small. This is one of those results where, even after seeing the proof, it still defies intuition.

87
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,780
The discord here is that the proof has us thinking analytically, with the rational numbers in a list,

88
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,480
but our intuition has us thinking geometrically, with all the rational numbers as a dense set on

89
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,040
the interval, where you can't skip over any continuous stretch because that would contain

90
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,060
infinitely many rationals. So let's get a visual understanding for what's going on.

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,380
Brief side note here, I had trouble deciding on how to illustrate small intervals, since if I

92
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,120
scale the parentheses with the interval, you won't be able to see them at all, but if I just push the

93
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,040
parentheses together, they cross over in a way that's potentially confusing. Nevertheless,

94
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,140
I decided to go with the ugly chromosomal cross, so keep in mind, the interval this represents is

95
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,480
that tiny stretch between the centers of each parentheses. Okay, back to the visual intuition.

96
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,980
Consider when epsilon equals 0.3, meaning if I choose a number between 0 and 1 at random,

97
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,740
there's a 70% chance that it's outside those infinitely many intervals. What does it look like

98
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:28,260
to be outside the intervals? The square root of 2 over 2 is among those 70%, and I'm going to zoom

99
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,180
in on it. As I do so, I'll draw the first 10 intervals in our list within our scope of vision.

100
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,880
As we get closer and closer to the square root of 2 over 2, even though you will always find

101
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,640
rationals within your field of view, the intervals placed on top of those rationals get really small,

102
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,500
really fast. One might say that for any sequence of rational numbers approaching the square root of 2

103
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,220
over 2, the intervals containing the elements of that sequence shrink faster than the sequence

104
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:05,340
converges. Notice, intervals are really small if they show up late in the list, and rationals show

105
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,200
up late in the list when they have large denominators. So the fact that the square root of 2

106
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,640
over 2 is among the 70% not covered by our intervals is, in a sense, a way to formalize

107
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,920
the otherwise vague idea that the only rational numbers close to it have a large denominator.

108
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:37,940
That is to say, the square root of 2 over 2 is cacophonous. In fact, let's use a smaller epsilon,

109
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,020
say 0.01, and shift our setup to lie on top of the interval from 1 to 2 instead of from 0 to 1.

110
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,800
Then which numbers fall among that elite 1% covered by our tiny intervals? Almost all of

111
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,880
them are harmonious. For instance, the harmonious irrational number 2 to the 7 twelfths is very

112
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,920
close to 3 halves, which has a relatively fat interval sitting on top of it, and the interval

113
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,700
around 4 thirds is smaller but still fat enough to cover 2 to the 5 twelfths. Which members of

114
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,700
the 1% are cacophonous? Well, the cacophonous rationals, meaning those with high denominators,

115
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,580
and irrationals that are very very very close to them. However, think of the savant who finds

116
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,120
harmonic patterns in all rational numbers. You could imagine that for her, harmonious numbers

117
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,320
are precisely those 1% covered by the intervals, provided that her tolerance for error goes down

118
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:44,060
exponentially for more complicated rationals. In other words, the seemingly paradoxical fact

119
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,840
that you can have a collection of intervals densely populate a range while only covering

120
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,640
1% of its values corresponds to the fact that harmonious numbers are rare, even for the savant.

121
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,700
I'm not saying this makes the result more intuitive. In fact, I find it quite surprising

122
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,920
that the savant I defined could find 99% of all ratios cacophonous.

123
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,620
But the fact that these two ideas are connected was simply too beautiful not to share.
