1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
I have two seemingly unrelated challenges for you. The first relates to music, and the

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,360
second gives a foundational result in measure theory, which is the formal underpinning for

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,280
how mathematicians define integration and probability. The second challenge, which I'll

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,020
get to about halfway through the video, has to do with covering numbers with open sets,

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,320
and is very counterintuitive. Or at least, when I first saw it, I was confused for a

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
while. Foremost, I'd like to explain what's going on, but I also plan to share a surprising

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,180
connection that it has with music. Here's the first challenge. I'm going to play a musical

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,000
note with a given frequency, let's say 220 Hz. Then I'm going to choose some number between

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,840
1 and 2, which we'll call R, and play a second musical note whose frequency is R times the

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,400
frequency of the first note, 220. For some values of R, like 1.5, the two notes will

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,520
sound harmonious together, but for others, like the square root of 2, they sound cacophonous.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,120
Your task is to determine whether a given ratio R will give a pleasant sound or an unpleasant

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,040
one just by analyzing the number, and without listening to the notes. One way to answer,

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,400
especially if your name is Pythagoras, might be to say that two notes sound good together

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,360
when the ratio is a rational number, and bad when it's irrational. For instance, a ratio

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,840
of 3 halves gives a musical fifth, 4 thirds gives a musical fourth, 8 fifths gives a major

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,180
sixth, and so on. Here's my best guess for why this is the case. A musical note is made

18
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,480
up of beats played in rapid succession, for instance 220 beats per second. When the ratio

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,160
of frequencies of two notes is rational, there's a detectable pattern in those beats, which

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,720
when we slow it down, we hear as a rhythm instead of as a harmony. Evidently, when our

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,720
brains pick up on this pattern, the two notes sound nice together. However, most rational

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:17,880
numbers actually sound pretty bad, like 211 over 198, or 1093 divided by 826. The issue,

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,160
of course, is that these rational numbers are somehow more complicated than the other

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:31,800
ones. Our ears don't pick up on the pattern of the beats. One simple way to measure complexity

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,760
of rational numbers is to consider the size of the denominator when it's written in reduced

26
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,640
form. So we might edit our original answer to only admit fractions with low denominators,

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:51,280
say less than 10. Even still, this doesn't quite capture harmoniousness, since plenty

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,100
of notes sound good together even when the ratio of their frequencies is irrational,

29
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,560
so long as it's close to a harmonious rational number. And it's a good thing too, because

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,720
many instruments, such as pianos, are not tuned in terms of rational intervals, but

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,960
are tuned such that each half step increase corresponds with multiplying the original

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,720
frequency by the 12th root of 2, which is irrational. If you're curious about why

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,620
this is done, Henry at MinutePhysics recently did a video that gives a very nice explanation.

34
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,240
This means that if you take a harmonious interval, like a fifth, the ratio of frequencies when

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,480
played on a piano will not be a nice rational number like you expect, in this case 3 halves,

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,680
but will instead be some power of the 12th root of 2, in this case 2 to the 7 over 12,

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:51,560
which is irrational, but very close to 3 halves. Similarly, a musical fourth corresponds to

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,860
2 to the 5 twelfths, which is very close to 4 thirds. In fact, the reason it works so

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,400
well to have 12 notes in the chromatic scale is that powers of the 12th root of 2 have

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:14,560
this strange tendency to be within a 1% margin of error of simple rational numbers.

41
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
So now you might say that a ratio R will produce a harmonious pair of notes if it is sufficiently

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,080
close to a rational number with a sufficiently small denominator. How close depends on how

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,840
discerning your ear is, and how small a denominator depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,760
your ear has been trained to pick up on. After all, maybe someone with a particularly

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,320
acute musical sense would be able to hear and find pleasure in the pattern resulting

46
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,880
from more complicated fractions, like 23 over 21, or 35 over 43, as well as numbers closely

47
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,920
approximating those fractions. This leads me to an interesting question.

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,800
Suppose there is a musical savant who finds pleasure in all pairs of notes whose frequencies

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,720
have a rational ratio, even the super complicated ratios that you and I would find cacophonous.

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,880
Is it the case that she would find all ratios R between 1 and 2 harmonious, even the irrational

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,500
ones? After all, for any given real number, you can always find a rational number arbitrarily

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,840
close to it, just like 3 halves is really close to 2 to the 7 over 12.

53
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,840
So, this brings us to challenge number 2.

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Mathematicians like to ask riddles about covering various sets with open intervals, and the

55
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,280
answers to these riddles have a strange tendency to become famous lemmas of theorems. By open

56
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,780
interval, I just mean the continuous stretch of real numbers strictly greater than some

57
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,400
number a, but strictly less than some other number b, where b is of course greater than

58
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,440
My challenge to you involves covering all of the rational numbers between 0 and 1 with

59
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,440
open intervals. When I say cover, all this means is that each particular rational number

60
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,920
lies inside at least one of your intervals. The most obvious way to do this is to just

61
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,320
use the entire interval from 0 to 1 itself and call it done, but the challenge here is

62
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:22,320
that the sum of the lengths of your intervals must be strictly less than 1.

63
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,920
To aid you in this seemingly impossible task, you're allowed to use infinitely many intervals.

64
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Even still, the task might feel impossible, since the rational numbers are dense in the

65
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,880
real numbers, meaning any stretch, no matter how small, contains infinitely many rational

66
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,120
numbers. So how could you possibly cover all of the rational numbers without just covering

67
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,040
the entire interval from 0 to 1 itself, which would mean the total length of your open intervals

68
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,040
has to be at least the length of the entire interval from 0 to 1? Then again, I wouldn't

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,960
be asking if there wasn't a way to do it.

70
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,480
First, we enumerate the rational numbers between 0 and 1, meaning we organize them into an

71
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,080
infinitely long list. There are many ways to do this, but one natural way that I'll

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,080
choose is to start with ½, followed by ⅓ and ⅔, then ¼ and ¾, we don't write down

73
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,640
¼ since it's already appeared as ½, then all reduced fractions with denominator 5,

74
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,960
all reduced fractions with denominator 6, continuing on and on in this fashion. Every

75
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,480
fraction will appear exactly once in this list in its reduced form, and it gives us

76
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,680
a meaningful way to talk about the first rational number, the second rational number,

77
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,720
the 42nd rational number, things like that.

78
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,200
Next, to ensure that each rational is covered, we're going to assign one specific interval

79
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,240
to each rational. Once we remove the intervals from the geometry of our setup and just think

80
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,920
of them in a list, each one responsible for one rational number, it seems much clearer

81
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,560
that the sum of their lengths can be less than 1, since each particular interval can

82
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,840
be as small as you want and still cover its designated rational. In fact, the sum can

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,600
be any positive number. Just choose an infinite sum with positive terms that converges to

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,600
1, like ½, plus ¼, plus ⅛, plus ⅛, on and on, then choose any desired value of epsilon

85
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,960
greater than 0, like 0.5, and multiply all of the terms in the sum by epsilon so that

86
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,280
you have an infinite sum converging to epsilon. Now, scale the nth interval to have a length

87
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,280
equal to the nth term in the sum. Notice, this means your intervals start getting really

88
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,880
small really fast, so small that you can't really see most of them in this animation,

89
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,880
but it doesn't matter, since each one is only responsible for covering one rational.

90
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I've said it already, but I'll say it again because it's so amazing, epsilon can be whatever positive number we want, so not only can our sum be less than 1, it can be arbitrarily small.

91
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,720
This is one of those results where even after seeing the proof, it still defies intuition.

92
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,160
The discord here is that the proof has us thinking analytically, with the rational numbers

93
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,280
in a list, but our intuition has us thinking geometrically, with all the rational numbers

94
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,300
as a dense set on the interval, where you can't skip over any continuous stretch because

95
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,440
that would contain infinitely many rationals. So let's get a visual understanding for

96
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
what's going on.

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,960
Brief side note here, I had trouble deciding on how to illustrate small intervals, since

98
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,320
if I scale the parentheses with the interval, you won't be able to see them at all, but

99
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,160
if I just push the parentheses together, they cross over in a way that's potentially confusing.

100
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,920
Nevertheless, I decided to go with the ugly chromosomal cross, so keep in mind, the interval

101
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,920
this represents is that tiny stretch between the centers of each parenthesis.

102
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Ok, back to the visual intuition.

103
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,080
Consider when epsilon equals 0.3, meaning if I choose a number between 0 and 1 at random,

104
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,040
there's a 70% chance that it's outside those infinitely many intervals.

105
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,840
What does it look like to be outside the intervals?

106
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,500
The square root of 2 over 2 is among those 70%, and I'm going to zoom in on it.

107
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,000
As I do so, I'll draw the first 10 intervals in our list within our scope of vision.

108
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,540
As we get closer and closer to the square root of 2 over 2, even though you will always

109
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,660
find rationals within your field of view, the intervals placed on top of those rationals

110
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,560
get really small, really fast.

111
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,800
You might say that for any sequence of rational numbers approaching the square root of 2 over

112
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,360
2, the intervals containing the elements of that sequence shrink faster than the sequence

113
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
converges.

114
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,280
Notice intervals are really small if they show up late in the list, and rationals show

115
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,760
up late in the list when they have large denominators.

116
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,240
So the fact that the square root of 2 over 2 is among the 70% not covered by our intervals

117
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,900
is in a sense a way to formalize the otherwise vague idea that the only rational numbers

118
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:27,280
close to it have a large denominator.

119
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:35,960
That is to say, the square root of 2 over 2 is cacophonous.

120
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,920
In fact, let's use a smaller epsilon, say 0.01, and shift our setup to lie on top of

121
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,840
the interval from 1 to 2 instead of from 0 to 1.

122
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Then which numbers fall among that elite 1% covered by our tiny intervals?

123
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,400
Almost all of them are harmonious.

124
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,320
For instance, the harmonious irrational number 2 to the 7 twelfths is very close to 3 halves,

125
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,960
which has a relatively fat interval sitting on top of it, and the interval around 4 thirds

126
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,200
is smaller, but still fat enough to cover 2 to the 5 twelfths.

127
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,680
Which members of the 1% are cacophonous?

128
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,240
Well, the cacophonous rationals, meaning those with high denominators, and irrationals that

129
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,560
are very very very close to them.

130
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,560
However, think of the savant who finds harmonic patterns in all rational numbers.

131
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,520
You could imagine that for her, harmonious numbers are precisely those 1% covered by

132
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,880
the intervals, provided that her tolerance for error goes down exponentially for more

133
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,400
complicated rationals.

134
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,120
In other words, the seemingly paradoxical fact that you can have a collection of intervals

135
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,920
densely populate a range while only covering 1% of its values corresponds to the fact that

136
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,560
harmonious numbers are rare, even for the savant.

137
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm not saying this makes the result more intuitive, in fact, I find it quite surprising

138
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,400
that the savant I defined could find 99% of all ratios cacophonous, but the fact that

139
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,680
these two ideas are connected was simply too beautiful not to share.
