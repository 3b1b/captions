1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,660
E raised to pi with an i.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,900
We've been taught by a lot that you've got minus one.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,600
Can we glean what this means?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,800
For such words are absurd.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,120
How to treat the repeat of a feat pi i times.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,842
This is bound to confound till your mind redefines 

7
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:23,280
these amounts one can't count which surmount our friend E.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,520
Numbers act as abstract functions which slide the ridge 

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,640
to the space in its place with a grace when they sum.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,936
Multiplied they don't slide acting a second way they 

11
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:34,300
rotate and dilate but keep straight the same plane.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,980
Now what we write as E to the X won't perplex when 

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,900
you know it's for show that X goes up and right.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
It does not as you thought repeat E product E.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,020
It functions with gumption on functions we've now seen.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,040
It turns slide side to side into growths and shrinks both.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,720
Up and downs come around as turns round which is key.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,488
This is why pi times i which slides north is brought 

19
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:55,080
forth and returned we have learned as a turn halfway round.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,900
Minus one matched by none turns this way and we're done.
