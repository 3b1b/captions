1
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:11,963
E to the pi i equals negative one is one of the most famous equations in math, 

2
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:13,900
but it's also one of the most confusing.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,960
Those watching this video likely fall into one of three categories.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,000
One, you know what each term means, but the statement as a whole seems nonsensical.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,009
Two, you were lucky enough to see what this means, 

6
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,089
and some long formulas explaining why it works in a calculus class, 

7
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,720
but it still feels like black magic.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,140
Or three, it's not entirely clear what the terms themselves are.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,016
Those in this last category might be in the best position to understand the 

10
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:40,813
explanation I'm about to give, since it doesn't require any calculus or advanced math, 

11
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:44,480
but will instead require an open-mindedness to reframing how we think about numbers.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,239
Once we do this, it will become clear what the equation means, 

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,500
why it's true, and most importantly why it makes intuitive sense.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,700
First let's get one thing straight.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,940
What we write as e to the x is not repeated multiplication.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,697
That would only make sense when x is a number that we can count, one, two, 

17
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:04,940
three, and so on, and even then you'd have to define the number e first.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,460
To understand what this function actually does, 

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,080
we first need to learn how to think about numbers as actions.

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,750
We are first taught to think about numbers as counting things, 

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,620
and addition and multiplication are thought of with respect to counting.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,293
However, this mode of thinking becomes tricky when we talk about fractional amounts, 

23
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,497
very tricky when we talk about irrational amounts, 

24
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:31,300
and downright nonsensical when we introduce things like the square root of negative one.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,824
Instead, we should think of each number as simultaneously being three things, 

26
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:40,296
a point on an infinitely extending line, an action which slides that line along itself, 

27
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:44,108
in which case we call it an adder, and an action which stretches the line, 

28
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,040
in which case we call it a multiplier.

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,510
When you think about a number as an adder, you could imagine adding it with 

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,619
all numbers as points on the line all at once, 

31
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,029
but instead forget that you already know anything about addition so that we 

32
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,600
can reframe how you think about it.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,780
Think of adders purely as sliding the line with the following rule.

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,683
You slide until the point corresponding to zero ends up 

35
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,280
where the point corresponding with the adder itself started.

36
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,829
When you successively apply two adders, the effect 

37
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,840
will be the same as just applying some other adder.

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,720
This is how we define their sum.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,680
Likewise, forget that you already know anything about multiplication, 

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,320
and think of a multiplier purely as a way to stretch the line.

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,806
Now, the rule is to fix zero in place, and bring the point corresponding 

42
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:27,991
with one to where the point corresponding with the multiplier itself started off, 

43
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,340
keeping everything evenly spaced as you do so.

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,364
Just as with adders, we can now redefine multiplication 

45
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:36,060
as the successive application of two different actions.

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,089
The life's ambition of e to the x is to transform adders into multipliers, 

47
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:43,000
and to do so as naturally as possible.

48
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,239
For instance, if you take two adders, successively apply them, 

49
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,445
then pump the resulting sum through the function, 

50
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:51,753
it's the same as first putting each adder through the function separately, 

51
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:54,180
then successively applying the two multipliers you get.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,700
More succinctly, e to the x plus y equals e to the x times e to the y.

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,679
If e to the x was thought of as repeated multiplication, 

54
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:05,100
this property would be a consequence, but really it goes the other way around.

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,931
You should think of this property as defining e to the x, 

56
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,945
and the fact that the special case of counting numbers has anything 

57
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:13,960
to do with repeated multiplication is a consequence of the property.

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,107
Multiple functions satisfy this property, but when you try to define one explicitly, 

59
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:24,040
one stands out as being the most natural, and we express it with this infinite sum.

60
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,520
By the way, the number e is just defined to be the value of this function at one.

61
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,804
The number isn't nearly as special as the function as a whole, 

62
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:35,412
and the convention to write this function as e to the x is 

63
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:38,020
a vestige of its relationship with repeated multiplication.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,737
The other, less natural function satisfying this 

65
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,920
property are the exponentials with different bases.

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,281
Now the expression e to the pi i at least seems to have some meaning, 

67
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:50,620
but you shouldn't think about this infinite sum when trying to make sense of it.

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,480
You only need to think about turning adders into multipliers.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,309
You see, we can also play this game of sliding and stretching in the 2D plane, 

70
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:02,140
and this is what complex numbers are.

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,308
Each number is simultaneously a point on the plane, 

72
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:09,034
an adder which slides the plane so that the point for 0 lands on the 

73
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,599
point for the number, and a multiplier which fixes 0 in place and 

74
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,459
brings the point for 1 to the point for the number while keeping everything evenly spaced.

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
This can now include rotating along with some stretching and shrinking.

76
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,224
All of the actions of the real numbers still apply, 

77
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:30,560
sliding side to side and stretching, but now we have a whole host of new actions.

78
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,360
For instance, take this point here.

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,400
We call it i.

80
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,968
As an adder, it slides the plane up, and as a multiplier, 

81
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:39,140
it turns it a quarter of the way around.

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,665
Since multiplying it by itself gives negative 1, which is to say, 

83
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:48,813
applying this action twice is the same as the action of negative 1 as a multiplier, 

84
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:51,020
it is the square root of negative 1.

85
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,828
All adding is some combination of sliding sideways and sliding up or down, 

86
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,440
and all multiplication is some combination of stretching and rotating.

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,910
Since we already know that e to the x turns slide side to side into stretches, 

88
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,198
the most natural thing you might expect is for it to turn this new dimension of adders, 

89
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:13,000
slides up and down, directly into the new dimension of multipliers, rotations.

90
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,782
In terms of points on the plane, this would mean e to the x takes points on this vertical 

91
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:20,954
line, which correspond to adders that slide the plane up and down, 

92
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:25,074
and puts them on the circle with radius 1, which corresponds with the multipliers that 

93
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,880
rotate the plane.

94
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,916
The most natural way you could imagine doing this is to wrap the line 

95
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,397
around the circle without stretching or squishing it, 

96
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:36,028
which would mean it takes a length of 2 pi to go completely around the circle, 

97
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:39,980
since by definition, this is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its radius.

98
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,040
This means going up pi would translate to going exactly halfway around the circle.

99
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,257
When in doubt, if there's a natural way to do things, 

100
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:51,700
this is exactly what e to the x will do, and this case is no exception.

101
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,058
If you want to see a full justification for why e to the x behaves this way, 

102
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:57,540
see this additional video here.

103
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,180
So there you have it.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:13,200
This function e to the x takes the adder pi i to the multiplier negative 1.
