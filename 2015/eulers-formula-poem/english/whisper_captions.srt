1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,680
E to the pi i equals negative one is one of the most famous equations in math, but it's

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,900
also one of the most confusing.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,960
Those watching this video likely fall into one of three categories.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,000
One, you know what each term means, but the statement as a whole seems nonsensical.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,620
Two, you were lucky enough to see what this means, and some long formulas explaining why

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,720
it works in a calculus class, but it still feels like black magic.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,140
Or three, it's not entirely clear what the terms themselves are.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,980
Those in this last category might be in the best position to understand the explanation

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,320
I'm about to give, since it doesn't require any calculus or advanced math, but will instead

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,480
require an open-mindedness to reframing how we think about numbers.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,760
Once we do this, it will become clear what the equation means, why it's true, and most

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,500
importantly why it makes intuitive sense.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,700
First let's get one thing straight.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,940
What we write as e to the x is not repeated multiplication.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,060
That would only make sense when x is a number that we can count, one, two, three, and so

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,940
on, and even then you'd have to define the number e first.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,740
To understand what this function actually does, we first need to learn how to think

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,080
about numbers as actions.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,940
We are first taught to think about numbers as counting things, and addition and multiplication

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,620
are thought of with respect to counting.

21
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,720
However, this mode of thinking becomes tricky when we talk about fractional amounts, very

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,640
tricky when we talk about irrational amounts, and downright nonsensical when we introduce

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,300
things like the square root of negative one.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,280
Instead, we should think of each number as simultaneously being three things, a point

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,200
on an infinitely extending line, an action which slides that line along itself, in which

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,300
case we call it an adder, and an action which stretches the line, in which case we call

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,040
it a multiplier.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,000
When you think about a number as an adder, you could imagine adding it with all numbers

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
as points on the line all at once, but instead forget that you already know anything about

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
addition so that we can reframe how you think about it.

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,780
Think of adders purely as sliding the line with the following rule.

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,880
You slide until the point corresponding to zero ends up where the point corresponding

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
with the adder itself started.

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,180
When you successively apply two adders, the effect will be the same as just applying some

35
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,840
other adder.

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,720
This is how we define their sum.

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,500
Likewise, forget that you already know anything about multiplication, and think of a multiplier

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,320
purely as a way to stretch the line.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,920
Now, the rule is to fix zero in place, and bring the point corresponding with one to

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,100
where the point corresponding with the multiplier itself started off, keeping everything evenly

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,340
spaced as you do so.

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,580
Just as with adders, we can now redefine multiplication as the successive application of two different

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,060
actions.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,440
The life's ambition of e to the x is to transform adders into multipliers, and to do so as naturally

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,000
as possible.

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,060
For instance, if you take two adders, successively apply them, then pump the resulting sum through

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,540
the function, it's the same as first putting each adder through the function separately,

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,180
then successively applying the two multipliers you get.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,700
More succinctly, e to the x plus y equals e to the x times e to the y.

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,840
If e to the x was thought of as repeated multiplication, this property would be a consequence, but

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,100
really it goes the other way around.

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,960
You should think of this property as defining e to the x, and the fact that the special

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,180
case of counting numbers has anything to do with repeated multiplication is a consequence

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,960
of the property.

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,960
Multiple functions satisfy this property, but when you try to define one explicitly,

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,040
one stands out as being the most natural, and we express it with this infinite sum.

57
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,520
By the way, the number e is just defined to be the value of this function at one.

58
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,620
The number isn't nearly as special as the function as a whole, and the convention to

59
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,020
write this function as e to the x is a vestige of its relationship with repeated multiplication.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,600
The other, less natural function satisfying this property are the exponentials with different

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:42,920
bases.

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,320
Now the expression e to the pi i at least seems to have some meaning, but you shouldn't

63
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,620
think about this infinite sum when trying to make sense of it.

64
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,480
You only need to think about turning adders into multipliers.

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,900
You see, we can also play this game of sliding and stretching in the 2D plane, and this is

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,140
what complex numbers are.

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,180
Each number is simultaneously a point on the plane, an adder which slides the plane so

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,120
that the point for 0 lands on the point for the number, and a multiplier which fixes 0

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,660
in place and brings the point for 1 to the point for the number while keeping everything

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,460
evenly spaced.

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
This can now include rotating along with some stretching and shrinking.

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,700
All of the actions of the real numbers still apply, sliding side to side and stretching,

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,560
but now we have a whole host of new actions.

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,360
For instance, take this point here.

75
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,400
We call it i.

76
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,500
As an adder, it slides the plane up, and as a multiplier, it turns it a quarter of the

77
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,140
way around.

78
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,320
Since multiplying it by itself gives negative 1, which is to say, applying this action twice

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,560
is the same as the action of negative 1 as a multiplier, it is the square root of negative

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,020
1.

81
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,060
All adding is some combination of sliding sideways and sliding up or down, and all multiplication

82
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,440
is some combination of stretching and rotating.

83
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,180
Since we already know that e to the x turns slide side to side into stretches, the most

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,940
natural thing you might expect is for it to turn this new dimension of adders, slides

85
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,000
up and down, directly into the new dimension of multipliers, rotations.

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,540
In terms of points on the plane, this would mean e to the x takes points on this vertical

87
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,880
line, which correspond to adders that slide the plane up and down, and puts them on the

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,880
circle with radius 1, which corresponds with the multipliers that rotate the plane.

89
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,620
The most natural way you could imagine doing this is to wrap the line around the circle

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,480
without stretching or squishing it, which would mean it takes a length of 2 pi to go

91
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,780
completely around the circle, since by definition, this is the ratio of the circumference of

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,980
a circle to its radius.

93
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,040
This means going up pi would translate to going exactly halfway around the circle.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,900
When in doubt, if there's a natural way to do things, this is exactly what e to the x

95
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,700
will do, and this case is no exception.

96
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,320
If you want to see a full justification for why e to the x behaves this way, see this

97
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,540
additional video here.

98
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,180
So there you have it.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,120
This function e to the x takes the adder pi i to the multiplier negative 1.

100
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,200
Thanks for watching!
