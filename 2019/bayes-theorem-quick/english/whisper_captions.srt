00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
This is a footnote to the main video on Bayes' Theorem.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,980
If your goal is simply to understand why it's true from a mathematical standpoint,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,640
there's actually a very quick way to see it based on breaking down how the word

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,280
AND works in probability.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,040
Let's say there are two events, A and B.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,520
What's the probability that both of them happen?

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,120
On the one hand, you could start by thinking of the probability of A,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,480
the proportion of all possibilities where A is true,

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,420
then multiply it by the proportion of those events where B is also true,

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,600
which is known as the probability of B given A.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,680
But it's strange for the formula to look asymmetric in A and B.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,600
Presumably, we should also be able to think of it as the proportion of cases where B is true,

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,900
among all possibilities, times the proportion of those where A is also true,

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,700
the probability of A given B.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,460
These are both the same, and the fact that they're both the same

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,600
gives us a way to express P of A given B in terms of P of B given A,

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,560
or the other way around.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,080
So when one of these conditions is easier to put numbers to than the other,

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,860
say when it's easier to think about the probability of seeing some evidence

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,680
given a hypothesis rather than the other way around,

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,880
this simple identity becomes a useful tool.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,420
Nevertheless, even if this is somehow a more pure or quick way to understand the formula,

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,340
the reason I chose to frame everything in terms of updating beliefs with evidence in the main video

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,900
is to help with that third level of understanding,

25
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,620
being able to recognize when this formula,

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,680
among the wide landscape of available tools in math, happens to be the right one to use.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,180
Otherwise, it's kind of easy to just look at it, nod along, and promptly forget.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,740
And you know, while we're here, it's worth highlighting a common misconception

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,480
that the probability of A and B is P of A times P of B.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,100
For example, if you hear that 1 in 4 people die of heart disease,

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,820
it's really tempting to think that that means the probability that both you and your brother

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,320
die of heart disease is 1 in 4 times 1 in 4, or 1 in 16.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,920
After all, the probability of two successive coin flips yielding tails is ½ times ½,

34
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,620
and the probability of rolling two 1s on a pair of dice is 1 6th times 1 6th, right?

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,220
The issue is correlation.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,500
If your brother dies of heart disease,

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,920
and considering certain genetic and lifestyle links that are at play here,

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,500
your chances of dying from a similar condition are higher.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,540
A formula like this, as tempting and clean as it looks, is just flat out wrong.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,980
What's going on with cases like flipping coins or rolling two dice

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,160
is that each event is independent of the last.

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
So the probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,380
What happens to A does not affect B. This is the definition of independence.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,700
Keep in mind, many introductory probability examples are given in very gamified contexts,

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,620
things with dice and coins, where genuine independence holds,

46
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,400
but all those examples can skew your intuitions.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,260
The irony is that some of the most interesting applications of probability,

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,720
presumably the whole motivation for the kind of courses using these gamified examples,

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,880
are only substantive when events aren't independent.

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,380
Bayes' theorem, which measures exactly how much one variable depends on another,

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,400
is a perfect example of this.
