00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
This is a footnote to the main video on Bayes' Theorem.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,240
If your goal is simply to understand why it's true from a mathematical standpoint,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,680
there's actually a very quick way to see it based on breaking down how the word

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,240
AND works in probability.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,360
Let's say there are two events, A and B.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,920
What's the probability that both of them happen?

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,360
On the one hand, you could start by thinking of the probability of A,

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,800
the proportion of all possibilities where A is true,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,680
then multiply it by the proportion of those events where B is also true,

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,400
which is known as the probability of B given A.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,880
But it's strange for the formula to look asymmetric in A and B.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,840
Presumably, we should also be able to think of it as the proportion of cases where B is true,

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,200
among all possibilities, times the proportion of those where A is also true,

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
the probability of A given B.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
These are both the same, and the fact that they're both the same

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,400
gives us a way to express P of A given B in terms of P of B given A,

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
or the other way around.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,360
So when one of these conditions is easier to put numbers to than the other,

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,880
say when it's easier to think about the probability of seeing some evidence

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
given a hypothesis rather than the other way around,

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
this simple identity becomes a useful tool.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,640
Nevertheless, even if this is somehow a more pure or quick way to understand the formula,

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,600
the reason I chose to frame everything in terms of updating beliefs with evidence in the main video

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
is to help with that third level of understanding,

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,800
being able to recognize when this formula,

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,520
among the wide landscape of available tools in math, happens to be the right one to use.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,160
Otherwise, it's kind of easy to just look at it, nod along, and promptly forget.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,800
And you know, while we're here, it's worth highlighting a common misconception

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,280
that the probability of A and B is P of A times P of B.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,440
For example, if you hear that 1 in 4 people die of heart disease,

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,080
it's really tempting to think that that means the probability that both you and your brother

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,320
die of heart disease is 1 in 4 times 1 in 4, or 1 in 16.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,240
After all, the probability of two successive coin flips yielding tails is ½ times ½,

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,520
and the probability of rolling two 1s on a pair of dice is 1 6th times 1 6th, right?

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
The issue is correlation.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
If your brother dies of heart disease,

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
and considering certain genetic and lifestyle links that are at play here,

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,880
your chances of dying from a similar condition are higher.

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
A formula like this, as tempting and clean as it looks, is just flat out wrong.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,240
What's going on with cases like flipping coins or rolling two dice

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,040
is that each event is independent of the last.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,320
So the probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,320
What happens to A does not affect B, this is the definition of independence.

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Keep in mind, many introductory probability examples are given in very gamified contexts,

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,880
things with dice and coins, where genuine independence holds,

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,680
but all those examples can skew your intuitions.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,520
The irony is that some of the most interesting applications of probability,

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,000
presumably the whole motivation for the kind of courses using these gamified examples,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
are only substantive when events aren't independent.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,600
Bayes' theorem, which measures exactly how much one variable depends on another,

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,240
is a perfect example of this.
