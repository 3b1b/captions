00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
This is a footnote to the main video on Bayes' Theorem.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,806
If your goal is simply to understand why it's true from a mathematical standpoint, 

3
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:11,038
there's actually a very quick way to see it based on breaking 

4
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,280
down how the word AND works in probability.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,040
Let's say there are two events, A and B.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,520
What's the probability that both of them happen?

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,291
On the one hand, you could start by thinking of the probability of A, 

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,449
the proportion of all possibilities where A is true, 

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,799
then multiply it by the proportion of those events where B is also true, 

10
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,600
which is known as the probability of B given A.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,680
But it's strange for the formula to look asymmetric in A and B.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,410
Presumably, we should also be able to think of it as the proportion 

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,613
of cases where B is true, among all possibilities, 

14
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:51,700
times the proportion of those where A is also true, the probability of A given B.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,524
These are both the same, and the fact that they're both the same gives us a way 

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:02,560
to express P of A given B in terms of P of B given A, or the other way around.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,586
So when one of these conditions is easier to put numbers to than the other, 

18
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:14,017
say when it's easier to think about the probability of seeing some evidence given 

19
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:18,880
a hypothesis rather than the other way around, this simple identity becomes a useful tool.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,685
Nevertheless, even if this is somehow a more pure or quick way to understand the formula, 

21
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,567
the reason I chose to frame everything in terms of updating beliefs with 

22
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,714
evidence in the main video is to help with that third level of understanding, 

23
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:36,489
being able to recognize when this formula, among the wide landscape of 

24
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:39,680
available tools in math, happens to be the right one to use.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,180
Otherwise, it's kind of easy to just look at it, nod along, and promptly forget.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,278
And you know, while we're here, it's worth highlighting a common 

27
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:53,480
misconception that the probability of A and B is P of A times P of B.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,421
For example, if you hear that 1 in 4 people die of heart disease, 

29
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,721
it's really tempting to think that that means the probability that both 

30
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:06,320
you and your brother die of heart disease is 1 in 4 times 1 in 4, or 1 in 16.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,381
After all, the probability of two successive coin flips yielding tails is ½ times ½, 

32
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:17,620
and the probability of rolling two 1s on a pair of dice is 1 6th times 1 6th, right?

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,220
The issue is correlation.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,089
If your brother dies of heart disease, and considering certain genetic and lifestyle 

35
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:30,500
links that are at play here, your chances of dying from a similar condition are higher.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,540
A formula like this, as tempting and clean as it looks, is just flat out wrong.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,142
What's going on with cases like flipping coins or rolling 

38
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:45,160
two dice is that each event is independent of the last.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
So the probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,380
What happens to A does not affect B.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,380
This is the definition of independence.

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,899
Keep in mind, many introductory probability examples are given in very gamified contexts, 

43
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:04,563
things with dice and coins, where genuine independence holds, 

44
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:07,400
but all those examples can skew your intuitions.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,794
The irony is that some of the most interesting applications of probability, 

46
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:16,229
presumably the whole motivation for the kind of courses using these gamified examples, 

47
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,880
are only substantive when events aren't independent.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,239
Bayes' theorem, which measures exactly how much one variable depends on another, 

49
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,800
is a perfect example of this.
