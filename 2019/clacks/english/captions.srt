00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sometimes, math and physics conspire in ways that just feel too good to be true.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,780
Let's play a strange sort of mathematical croquet.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,540
We're going to have two sliding blocks and a wall.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,221
The first block starts by coming in at some velocity from the right, 

5
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,180
while the second one starts out stationary.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,796
Being overly idealistic physicists, let's assume there's no friction and 

7
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:27,780
all of the collisions are perfectly elastic, which means no energy is lost.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,308
The astute among you might complain that such collisions would make no sound, 

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,465
but your goal here is to count how many collisions take place, 

10
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:39,976
so in slight conflict with that assumption I want to leave a little clack sound to better 

11
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,680
draw your attention to that count.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,920
The simplest case is when both blocks have the same mass.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,615
The first block hits the second, transferring all of its momentum, 

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,899
then the second one bounces off the wall, and then transfers all of 

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,280
its momentum back to the first, which then sails off towards infinity.

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,800
Three total clacks.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,180
What about if the first block was 100 times the mass of the second one?

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,061
I promise I will explain to you all the relevant physics in due course, 

19
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:08,058
it's not entirely obvious how you would predict the dynamics here, 

20
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:11,280
but in the spirit of getting to the punchline, let's watch what happens.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,228
The second one will keep bouncing back and forth between the wall and the first block, 

22
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,014
100 times its mass, like a satisfying game of Breakout, 

23
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,894
slowly and discreetly redirecting that first block's momentum to point in the 

24
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:23,840
opposite direction.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,087
In total, there will be 31 collisions before each block is sliding off towards infinity, 

26
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:30,620
never to be touched again.

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,180
What if the first block was 10,000 times the mass of the second one?

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,708
In that case, there would be quite a few more clacks, 

29
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:48,160
all happening very rapidly at one point, adding up and all to 313 total collisions.

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,040
Well, actually, hang on.

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,040
Wait for it.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,280
Wait for it.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,480
Okay, 314 clacks.

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,800
If the first block was 1,000,000 times the mass of the other, then again, 

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,057
with all of our crazy idealistic conditions, almost all of the clacks 

36
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:12,680
happen in one big burst, this time resulting in a total of 3,141 collisions.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,096
Perhaps you see the pattern here, though it's forgivable if you don't, 

38
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,600
since it defies all expectation.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,711
When the mass of that first block is some power of 100 times the mass of the second, 

40
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:27,200
the total number of collisions have the same digits as pi.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,260
This absolutely blew my mind when it was first shared with me.

42
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,391
Credit to the viewer Henry Cavill for introducing me to this fact, 

43
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:39,957
which was originally discovered by the mathematician Gregory Galperin in 1995 and 

44
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:40,960
published in 2003.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,733
Part of what I love about this is that if ever there were Olympic games 

46
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,493
for algorithms that compute pi, this one would have to win medals both 

47
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:53,360
for being the most elegant, and for being the most comically inefficient.

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,220
I mean, think about the actual algorithm here.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,420
Step 1, implement a physics engine.

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,000
Step 2, choose the number of digits d of pi you'd like to compute.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,803
Step 3, set the mass of one of the blocks to be 100 to the power d-1, 

52
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:12,280
then send it travelling on a frictionless surface towards a block of mass 1.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,980
Step 4, count all of the collisions.

54
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,213
For example, to calculate only 20 digits of pi, which fits so cleanly on this screen, 

55
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:25,839
one block would have to have 100 billion billion billion billion times the mass of 

56
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,793
the other, which if that small block was 1 kilogram, 

57
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:33,419
means the big one has a mass about 10 times that of the supermassive black hole at 

58
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,980
the center of the Milky Way.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,920
That means you would need to count 31 billion billion collisions.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,515
At one point in this virtual process, the frequency of clacks would 

61
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,900
be around 100 billion billion billion billion clacks per second.

62
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,063
So let's just say you would need very good numerical precision to get this working 

63
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,480
accurately, and it would take a very long time for the algorithm to complete.

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,314
I'll emphasize again that this process is way over-idealized, 

65
00:03:57,314 --> 00:04:00,960
quickly departing from anything that could possibly happen in real physics.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,252
But of course, you all know this is not interesting because of its potential 

67
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:08,700
as an actual pi computing algorithm or as a pragmatic physics demonstration.

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,440
It's mind-boggling because why on earth would pi show up here?

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,380
And it's in such a weird way too.

70
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,777
Its decimal digits are counting something, but usually pi shows 

71
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,940
up when its precise value is describing something continuous.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,200
I will show you why this is true.

73
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,226
Where there is pi, there is a hidden circle, and in this case, 

74
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,620
that hidden circle comes from the conservation of energy.

75
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,482
In fact, you're going to see two separate methods, 

76
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,380
which are each as stunning and surprising as the fact itself.

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,157
Delaying gratification though, I will make you 

78
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:42,240
wait until the next video to see what's going on.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,387
In the meantime, I highly encourage you to take a stab at it yourself, 

80
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,640
and be social about it.

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,640
It's a hard puzzle, so it never hurts to recruit some other smart minds to the task.

82
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:12,240
Thank you.
