1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
You know that feeling you get when you have two mirrors facing each other,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,840
and it gives the illusion of there being an infinite tunnel of rooms.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,080
Or, if they're at an angle with each other,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,880
it makes you feel like you're a part of a strange kaleidoscopic world with many copies of yourself,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,080
all separated by angled pieces of glass.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,520
What many people may not realize is that the idea underlying these illusions

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,400
can be surprisingly helpful for solving serious problems in math.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,840
We've already seen two videos describing the block-collision puzzle,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,080
with its wonderfully surprising answer.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,480
Big block comes in from the bright, lots of clacks, the total number of clacks looks like pi,

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,600
and we want to know why.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,000
Here, we see one more perspective explaining what's going on,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,520
where if the connection to pi wasn't surprising enough,

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,880
we add one more unexpected connection to optics.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,720
But we're doing more than just answering the same question twice.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,920
This alternate solution gives a much richer understanding of the whole setup,

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,440
and it makes it easier to answer other questions.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,040
And fun side note, it happens to be core to how I coded the accurate simulations of these blocks

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,240
without requiring absurdly small time steps and huge computation time.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,000
The solution from the last video involved a coordinate plane,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
where each point encodes a pair of velocities.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,320
Here, we'll do something similar,

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,720
but the points of our plane are going to encode the pair of positions of both blocks.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,600
Again, the idea is that by representing the state of a changing system

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,920
with individual points in some space,

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,760
problems in dynamics turn into problems in geometry,

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,200
which hopefully are more solvable.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,880
Specifically, let the x-coordinate of a 2D plane represent the distance from the wall

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,240
to the left edge of the first block, what I'll call d1,

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,920
and let the y-coordinate represent the distance from the wall

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,080
to the right edge of the second block, what we'll call d2.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,600
That way, the line y equals x shows us where the two blocks clack into each other,

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,800
since this happens whenever d1 is equal to d2.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Here's what it looks like for our scenario to play out.

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,240
As the two distances of our blocks change,

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,880
the two dimensional points of our configuration space move around,

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,600
with positions that always fully encode the information of those two distances.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,840
You may notice that at the bottom there, it's bounded by a line,

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
where d2 is the same as the small block's width,

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,480
which, if you think about it, is what it means for the small block to hit the wall.

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,920
You may be able to guess where we're going with this.

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
The way this point bounces between the two bounding lines

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,760
is a bit like a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,280
The analogy doesn't quite work, though.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,480
In the lingo of optics, the angle of incidence doesn't equal the angle of reflection.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,000
Just think of the first collision.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,640
A beam of light coming in from the right would bounce off of a 45 degree angled mirror,

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,880
this x equals y line, in such a way that it ends up going straight down,

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,280
which would mean that only the second block is moving.

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,320
This does happen in the simplest case, where the second block has the same mass as the first,

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,280
and picks up all of its momentum like a croquet ball.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,180
But in the general case, for other mass ratios, that first block keeps much of its momentum,

53
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,840
so the trajectory of our point in this configuration space won't be pointed straight down,

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,200
it'll be down and to the left a bit.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920
And even if it's not immediately clear why this analogy with light would actually be helpful,

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,520
and trust me, it will be helpful in many ways,

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,760
run with me here and see if we can fix this for the general case.

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,040
Seeking analogies in math is very often a good idea.

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,840
As with the last video, it's helpful to rescale the coordinates.

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,040
In fact, motivated by precisely what we did then,

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,000
you might think to rescale the coordinates so that x is not equal to d1,

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,720
which is equal to the square root of the first mass, m1, times d1.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
This has the effect of stretching our space horizontally,

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,440
so changes in our big block's position now result in larger changes to the x-coordinate itself.

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,960
And likewise, let's write the y-coordinate as square root of m2 times d2,

66
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,520
even though in this particular case the second mass is 1, so it doesn't make a difference,

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,040
but let's keep things symmetric.

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,340
Maybe this strikes you as making things uglier, and kind of a random thing to do,

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,180
but as with last time, when we include square roots of masses like this,

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,820
everything plays more nicely with the laws of conserving energy and momentum.

71
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,020
Specifically, the conservation of energy will translate into the fact that our little point in the space

72
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,340
is always moving at the same speed,

73
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,020
which in our analogy you might think of meaning there's a constant speed of light.

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,220
And the conservation of momentum will translate to the fact that

75
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,300
as our point bounces off of the mirrors of our setup, so to speak,

76
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,700
the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

77
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,660
Doesn't that seem bizarre in kind of a delightful way,

78
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,980
that the laws of kinematics should translate to laws of optics like this?

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,940
To see why it's true, let's roll up our sleeves and work out the actual math.

80
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,420
Focus on the velocity vector of our point in the diagram.

81
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,420
It shows which direction it's moving and how quickly.

82
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,140
Now keep in mind, this is not a physical velocity, like the velocities of the moving blocks,

83
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,340
instead it's a more abstract rate of change in the context of this configuration space,

84
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,260
whose two dimensions worth of possible directions encode both velocities of the block.

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,540
The x-component of this little vector is the rate of change of x,

86
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,540
and likewise its y-component is the rate of change of y.

87
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,940
But what is that rate of change for the x-coordinate?

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,580
Well, x is the square root of m1 times d1, and the mass doesn't change,

89
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,380
so it depends only on how d1 changes.

90
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,860
And what's the rate at which d1 changes?

91
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,500
Well that's the velocity of the big block, let's call that v1.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:00,140
Likewise, the rate of change for y is going to be the square root of m2 times v2.

93
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,820
Now, notice what the magnitude of our little configuration space changing vector is.

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,060
Using the Pythagorean theorem, it's the square root of the sum of each of these component rates of change squared,

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,380
which is square root of m1 times v1 squared plus m2 times v2 squared.

96
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,900
This inner expression should look awfully familiar, it's exactly twice the kinetic energy of our system.

97
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,100
So the speed of our point in the configuration space is some function of the total energy,

98
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,580
and that stays constant throughout the whole process.

99
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,700
Remember, a core over-idealizing assumption to this

100
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,980
is that there's no energy lost to friction or to any of the collisions.

101
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,660
Alright, so that's pretty cool.

102
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,460
With these rescaled coordinates, our little point is always moving with a constant speed.

103
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,180
And I know it's not obvious why you would care, but among other things, it's important for the next step,

104
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,660
where the conservation of momentum implies that these two bounding lines act like mirrors.

105
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:04,060
First, let's understand this line d1 equals d2 a little bit better.

106
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,980
In our new coordinates, it's no longer that nice 45 degree x equals y line.

107
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,980
Instead, if we do a little algebraic manipulation here,

108
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,500
we can see that that line is x over square root m1 equals y over square root m2.

109
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,820
Rearranging a little bit more, we see that's a line with a slope of square root m2 over m1.

110
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,460
That's a nice expression to tuck away in the back of your mind.

111
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,660
After the blocks collide, meaning our point hits this line,

112
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,500
the way to figure out how they move is to use the conservation of momentum,

113
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,540
which says that the value m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2 is the same both before and after the collision.

114
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,660
Now notice, this looks like a dot product between two column vectors, m1m2 and v1v2.

115
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,100
Rewriting it slightly for our rescaled coordinates,

116
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,740
the same thing could be written as a dot product between a column vector with the square roots of

117
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,660
the masses, and one with the rates of change for x and y. I know this probably seems like a

118
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,140
complicated way to talk about a comparatively simple momentum equation, but there is a good

119
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,900
reason for shifting the language to one of dot products in our new coordinates.

120
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,060
Notice that second vector is simply the rate of change vector for the point in our diagram

121
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,860
that we've been looking at. The key now is that the square root of the masses vector

122
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,780
points in the same direction as our collision line, since the rise over run is square root m2

123
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,060
over square root of m1. Now if you're unfamiliar with the dot product, there is another video on

124
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,460
this channel describing it, but real quick let's go over what it means geometrically.

125
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,380
The dot product of two vectors equals the length of the first one multiplied by the length of the

126
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,580
projection of the second one onto that first, where it's considered negative if they point

127
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,260
in opposite directions. You often see this written as the product of the lengths of the two vectors

128
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,340
and the cosine of the angle between them.

129
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,340
So look back at this conservation of momentum expression, telling us that the dot product

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,540
between this square root of the masses vector and our little change vector has to be the same,

131
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,900
both before and after the collision. Since we just saw that this change vector has a constant

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,500
magnitude, the only way for this dot product to stay the same is if the angle that it makes with

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,500
the collision line stays the same. In other words, again using the lingo of optics, the angle of

134
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,860
incidence and the angle of reflection off this collision line must be equal. Similarly, when the

135
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,660
small block bounces off the wall, our little vector gets reflected about the x direction,

136
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,620
since only its y coordinate changes. So our configuration point is bouncing off that

137
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,060
horizontal line as if it was a mirror. So step back a moment and think about what this means

138
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,380
for our original question of counting block collisions and trying to understand why on

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Earth pi would show up. We can translate it to a completely different question.

140
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,580
If you shine a beam of light at a pair of mirrors, meeting each other at some angle,

141
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,420
let's say theta, how many times would that light bounce off of the mirrors as a function of that

142
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,420
angle? Remember, the mass ratio of our blocks completely determines this angle theta in the

143
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,420
analogy. Now I can hear some of you complaining, haven't we just replaced one tricky setup with

144
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,780
another? This might make for a cute analogy, but how is it progress? It's true that counting the

145
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,020
number of light bounces is hard, but now we have a helpful trick. When the beam of light hits the

146
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,660
mirror, instead of thinking of that beam as reflected about the mirror, think of the beam

147
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,700
as going straight while the whole world gets flipped through the mirror. It's as if the beam

148
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,220
is passing through a piece of glass into an illusory looking glass universe. Think of actual

149
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,580
mirrors here. This wire on the left will represent a laser beam coming into the mirror, and the one

150
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,260
on the right will represent its reflection. The illusion is that the beam goes straight through

151
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,460
the mirror, as if passing through a window separating us from another room. But notice,

152
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,940
crucially, for this illusion to work, the angle of incidence has to equal the angle of reflection,

153
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,340
otherwise the flipped copy of the reflected beam won't line up with the first part. So all

154
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,260
of that work we did, rescaling coordinates and futzing through the momentum equations,

155
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:29,100
was certainly necessary. But now we get to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Watch how this helps us

156
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,660
elegantly solve the question of how many mirror bounces there will be, which is also the question

157
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,740
of how many block collisions there will be. Every time the beam hits a mirror, don't think of the

158
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,060
beam as getting reflected, let it continue straight while the world gets reflected. As this goes on,

159
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,700
the illusion to the beam of light is that instead of getting bounced around between two angled

160
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,780
mirrors many times, it's passing through a sequence of angled pieces of glass all the same angle apart.

161
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,460
Right now I'm showing you all of the reflected copies of the bouncing trajectory,

162
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,620
which I think has a very striking beauty to it.

163
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,460
But for a clear review, let's just focus on the original bouncing beam and the illusory straight

164
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,140
one. The question of counting bounces turns into a question of how many pieces of glass

165
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,860
this illusory beam crosses. How many reflected copies of the world does it pass into?

166
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:41,580
Well, calling the angle between the mirrors theta, the answer here is however many times you can add

167
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,180
theta to itself before you get more than halfway around a circle, which is to say, before you add

168
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:55,100
up to more than pi total radians. Written as a formula, the answer to this question is the floor

169
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,580
of pi divided by theta. So let's review. We started by drawing a configuration space for

170
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,140
our colliding blocks where the x and the y coordinates represented the two distances from

171
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:12,140
the wall. This kind of looked like light bouncing between two mirrors, but to make the analogy work

172
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,340
properly we needed to rescale the coordinates by the square roots of the masses. This made it so

173
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:23,660
that the slope of one of our lines was square root of m2 divided by square root of m1, so the angle

174
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,340
between those bounding lines will be the inverse tangent of that slope. To figure out how many

175
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,900
bounces there are between two mirrors like this, think of the illusion of the beam going straight

176
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,340
through a sequence of looking glass universes separated by a semi-circular fan of windows.

177
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,700
The answer then comes down to how many times the value of this angle fits into 180 degrees,

178
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,940
which is pi radians. From here, to understand why exactly the digits of pi show up when the mass

179
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,380
ratio is a power of 100, it's exactly what we did in the last video, so I won't repeat myself here.

180
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,220
And finally, as we reflect now on how absurd the initial appearance of pi seemed,

181
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,740
and on the two solutions we've now seen, and on how unexpectedly helpful it can be to represent

182
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,780
the state of your system with points in some space, I leave you with this quote from the

183
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,620
computer scientist Alan Kay. A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.
