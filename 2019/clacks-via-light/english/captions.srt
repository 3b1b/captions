1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,302
You know that feeling you get when you have two mirrors facing each other, 

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:06,340
and it gives the illusion of there being an infinite tunnel of rooms.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,014
Or, if they're at an angle with each other, it makes you feel 

4
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:14,212
like you're a part of a strange kaleidoscopic world with many copies of yourself, 

5
00:00:14,212 --> 00:00:16,260
all separated by angled pieces of glass.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,866
What many people may not realize is that the idea underlying these 

7
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:25,060
illusions can be surprisingly helpful for solving serious problems in math.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,655
We've already seen two videos describing the block-collision puzzle, 

9
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,620
with its wonderfully surprising answer.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,715
Big block comes in from the bright, lots of clacks, 

11
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,960
the total number of clacks looks like pi, and we want to know why.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,874
Here, we see one more perspective explaining what's going on, 

13
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:48,795
where if the connection to pi wasn't surprising enough, 

14
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:51,300
we add one more unexpected connection to optics.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,340
But we're doing more than just answering the same question twice.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,914
This alternate solution gives a much richer understanding of the whole setup, 

17
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:00,060
and it makes it easier to answer other questions.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,663
And fun side note, it happens to be core to how I coded the accurate simulations of 

19
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:08,540
these blocks without requiring absurdly small time steps and huge computation time.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,468
The solution from the last video involved a coordinate plane, 

21
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:14,820
where each point encodes a pair of velocities.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,478
Here, we'll do something similar, but the points of our 

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,200
plane are going to encode the pair of positions of both blocks.

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,384
Again, the idea is that by representing the state of a changing 

25
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:29,102
system with individual points in some space, problems in dynamics 

26
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:32,820
turn into problems in geometry, which hopefully are more solvable.

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,177
Specifically, let the x-coordinate of a 2D plane represent the distance from the wall 

28
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:42,353
to the left edge of the first block, what I'll call d1, 

29
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:47,288
and let the y-coordinate represent the distance from the wall to the right edge of the 

30
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:49,160
second block, what we'll call d2.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,609
That way, the line y equals x shows us where the two blocks clack into each other, 

32
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:00,940
since this happens whenever d1 is equal to d2.

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,320
Here's what it looks like for our scenario to play out.

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,106
As the two distances of our blocks change, the two dimensional 

35
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:11,588
points of our configuration space move around, 

36
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:15,760
with positions that always fully encode the information of those two distances.

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,592
You may notice that at the bottom there, it's bounded by a line, 

38
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:22,480
where d2 is the same as the small block's width, which, 

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,400
if you think about it, is what it means for the small block to hit the wall.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,440
You may be able to guess where we're going with this.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,033
The way this point bounces between the two bounding lines 

42
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:36,160
is a bit like a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors.

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,960
The analogy doesn't quite work, though.

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,800
In the lingo of optics, the angle of incidence doesn't equal the angle of reflection.

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,540
Just think of the first collision.

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,582
A beam of light coming in from the right would bounce off a 45 degree angled mirror, 

47
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:57,501
this x equals y line, in such a way that it ends up going straight down, 

48
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:00,400
which would mean that only the second block is moving.

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,965
This does happen in the simplest case, where the second block has the same 

50
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:08,600
mass as the first, and picks up all of its momentum like a croquet ball.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,581
But in the general case, for other mass ratios, 

52
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:15,170
that first block keeps much of its momentum, so the trajectory of our 

53
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,554
point in this configuration space won't be pointed straight down, 

54
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:20,400
it'll be down and to the left a bit.

55
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,392
And even if it's not immediately clear why this analogy with light 

56
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:27,984
would actually be helpful, and trust me, it will be helpful in many ways, 

57
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:31,140
run with me here and see if we can fix this for the general case.

58
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,700
Seeking analogies in math is very often a good idea.

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,140
As with the last video, it's helpful to rescale the coordinates.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,789
In fact, motivated by precisely what we did then, 

61
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:47,153
you might think to rescale the coordinates so that x is not equal to d1, 

62
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:50,980
but is equal to the square root of the first mass, m1, times d1.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,672
This has the effect of stretching our space horizontally, 

64
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:58,594
so changes in our big block's position now result in larger changes to the 

65
00:03:58,594 --> 00:03:59,640
x-coordinate itself.

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,818
And likewise, let's write the y-coordinate as square root of m2 times d2, 

67
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,544
even though in this particular case the second mass is 1, 

68
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:09,600
so it doesn't make a difference, but let's keep things symmetric.

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,940
Maybe this strikes you as making things uglier, and kind of a random thing to do, 

70
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,911
but as with last time, when we include square roots of masses like this, 

71
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:23,100
everything plays more nicely with the laws of conserving energy and momentum.

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,995
Specifically, the conservation of energy will translate into the fact that our 

73
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,209
little point in the space is always moving at the same speed, 

74
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,512
which in our analogy you might think of meaning there's a constant speed of light, 

75
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:39,556
and the conservation of momentum will translate to the fact that as our point 

76
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:42,200
bounces off the mirrors of our setup, so to speak, 

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,000
the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

78
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,595
Doesn't that seem bizarre in kind of a delightful way, 

79
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:53,280
that the laws of kinematics should translate to laws of optics like this?

80
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,440
To see why it's true, let's roll up our sleeves and work out the actual math.

81
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,960
Focus on the velocity vector of our point in the diagram.

82
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,640
It shows which direction it's moving and how quickly.

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,716
Now keep in mind, this is not a physical velocity, 

84
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:09,740
like the velocities of the moving blocks.

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,651
Instead, it's a more abstract rate of change in the context of this configuration space, 

86
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:20,920
whose two dimensions worth of possible directions encode both velocities of the block.

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,277
The x component of this little vector is the rate of change of x, 

88
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:33,940
and likewise its y component is the rate of change of y.

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,200
What is the rate of change for the x-coordinate?

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,490
x is the square root of m1 times d1, and the mass doesn't change, 

91
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,840
so it depends only on how d1 changes.

92
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,420
What's the rate at which d1 changes?

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,880
Well, that's the velocity of the big block.

94
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,700
Let's call that v1.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,580
Likewise, the rate of change for y is the square root of m2 times v2.

96
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,240
Now, notice what the magnitude of our little configuration space changing vector is.

97
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,589
Using the Pythagorean theorem, it's the square root of the 

98
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,205
sum of each of these component rates of change squared, 

99
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:17,660
which is square root of m1 times v1 squared plus m2 times v2 squared.

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,890
This inner expression should look awfully familiar, 

101
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,420
it's exactly twice the kinetic energy of our system.

102
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,620
So the speed of our point in the configuration space is some function of 

103
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,240
the total energy, and that stays constant throughout the whole process.

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,934
Remember, a core over-idealizing assumption to this is that 

105
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:38,100
there's no energy lost to friction or to any of the collisions.

106
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
All right, so that's pretty cool.

107
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,980
With these rescaled coordinates, our little point is always moving with a constant speed.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,964
And I know it's not obvious why you would care, but among other things, 

109
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:53,189
it's important for the next step, where the conservation of momentum 

110
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,760
implies that these two bounding lines act like mirrors.

111
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,800
First, let's understand this line d1 equals d2 a little bit better.

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,120
In our new coordinates, it's no longer that nice 45 degree x equals y line.

113
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,551
Instead, if we do a little algebraic manipulation here, 

114
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:17,940
we can see that that line is x over square root m1 equals y over square root m2.

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,101
Rearranging a little bit more, we see that's a 

116
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:23,480
line with a slope of square root m2 over m1.

117
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,540
That's a nice expression to tuck away in the back of your mind.

118
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,655
After the blocks collide, meaning our point hits this line, 

119
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:38,310
the way to figure out how they move is to use the conservation of momentum, 

120
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,149
which says that the value m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2 is the same both before 

121
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,620
and after the collision.

122
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,100
Now notice, this looks like a dot product between two column vectors, m1m2 and v1v2.

123
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,222
Rewriting it slightly for our rescaled coordinates, 

124
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:58,628
the same thing could be written as a dot product between a column 

125
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:03,220
vector with the square roots of the masses, and one with the rates of change for x and y.

126
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,341
I know this probably seems like a complicated way to talk about a 

127
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,551
comparatively simple momentum equation, but there is a good reason 

128
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:14,000
for shifting the language to one of dot products in our new coordinates.

129
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,481
Notice that second vector is simply the rate of change vector 

130
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:21,120
for the point in our diagram that we've been looking at.

131
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,648
The key now is that this square root of the masses vector points in the same direction 

132
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:32,240
as our collision line, since the rise over run is square root m2 over square root of m1.

133
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,304
Now if you're unfamiliar with the dot product, 

134
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,608
there is another video on this channel describing it, 

135
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,039
but real quick let's go over what it means geometrically.

136
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,479
The dot product of two vectors equals the length of the first one 

137
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:48,946
multiplied by the length of the projection of the second one onto that first, 

138
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,840
where it's considered negative if they point in opposite directions.

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,663
You often see this written as the product of the lengths of the two vectors, 

140
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,880
and the cosine of the angle between them.

141
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,520
So look back at this conservation of momentum expression, 

142
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,414
telling us that the dot product between this square root of the masses 

143
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:14,485
vector and our little change vector has to be the same, 

144
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,460
both before and after the collision.

145
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,848
Since we just saw that this change vector has a constant magnitude, 

146
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:24,229
the only way for this dot product to stay the same is if the 

147
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,500
angle that it makes with the collision line stays the same.

148
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,816
In other words, again using the lingo of optics, 

149
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:35,460
the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection off this collision line must be equal.

150
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,928
Similarly, when the small block bounces off the wall, 

151
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,820
our little vector gets reflected about the x direction, 

152
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,680
since only its y coordinate changes.

153
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,760
So our configuration point is bouncing off that horizontal line as if it was a mirror.

154
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,936
So step back a moment and think about what this means for our original question of 

155
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:57,680
counting block collisions and trying to understand why on earth pi would show up.

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
We can translate it to a completely different question.

157
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,172
If you shine a beam of light at a pair of mirrors, 

158
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:07,004
meeting each other at some angle, let's say theta, 

159
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:11,780
how many times would that light bounce off of the mirrors as a function of that angle?

160
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,980
Remember, the mass ratio of our blocks determines this angle theta in the analogy.

161
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,633
Now I can hear some of you complaining, haven't 

162
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,840
we just replaced one tricky setup with another?

163
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,920
This might make for a cute analogy, but how is it progress?

164
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,300
It's true that counting the number of light bounces is hard, 

165
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,220
but now we have a helpful trick.

166
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,815
When the beam of light hits the mirror, instead of thinking of 

167
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:40,623
that beam as reflected about the mirror, think of the beam as going straight, 

168
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:43,260
while the whole world gets flipped through the mirror.

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,221
It's as if the beam is passing through a piece 

170
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:48,620
of glass into an illusory looking glass universe.

171
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,060
Think of actual mirrors here.

172
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,953
This wire on the left will represent a laser beam coming into the mirror, 

173
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,520
and the one on the right will represent its reflection.

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,706
The illusion is that the beam goes straight through the mirror, 

175
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:05,040
as if passing through a window separating us from another room.

176
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,792
But notice, crucially, for this illusion to work, 

177
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,480
the angle of incidence has to equal the angle of reflection.

178
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,240
Otherwise, the flipped copy of the reflected beam won't line up with the first part.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,900
So all of that work we did, rescaling coordinates and futzing 

180
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,520
through the momentum equations, was certainly necessary.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,520
But now we get to enjoy the fruits of our labor.

182
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,844
Watch how this helps us elegantly solve the question of how many mirror bounces 

183
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:35,780
there will be, which is also the question of how many block collisions there will be.

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,304
Every time the beam hits a mirror, don't think of the beam as getting reflected, 

185
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:46,280
let it continue straight while the world gets reflected.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,861
As this goes on, the illusion to the beam of light is that instead of 

187
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:54,281
getting bounced around between two angled mirrors many times, 

188
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:58,860
it's passing through a sequence of angled pieces of glass all the same angle apart.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,538
Right now I'm showing you all of the reflected copies of the bouncing trajectory, 

190
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:07,140
which I think has a very striking beauty to it.

191
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,854
But for a clearer view, let's just focus on the 

192
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:16,940
original bouncing beam and the illusory straight one.

193
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,680
The question of counting bounces turns into a question 

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,720
of how many pieces of glass this illusory beam crosses.

195
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,980
How many reflected copies of the world does it pass into?

196
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,159
Well, calling the angle between the mirrors theta, 

197
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,959
the answer here is however many times you can add theta to itself before you 

198
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,696
get more than halfway around a circle, which is to say before you add up to 

199
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,380
more than pi total radians.

200
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,620
Written as a formula, the answer to this question is the floor of pi divided by theta.

201
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,680
So let's review.

202
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,937
We started by drawing a configuration space for our colliding blocks where 

203
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:06,640
the x and the y coordinates represented the two distances from the wall.

204
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,751
This kind of looked like light bouncing between two mirrors, 

205
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,744
but to make the analogy work properly we needed to rescale the coordinates by the 

206
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,060
square roots of the masses.

207
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,440
This made it so that the slope of one of our lines was square 

208
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,061
root of m2 divided by square root of m1, so the angle between 

209
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:27,740
those bounding lines will be the inverse tangent of that slope.

210
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,220
To figure out how many bounces there are between two mirrors like this, 

211
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,652
think of the illusion of the beam going straight through a sequence of 

212
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:38,940
looking glass universes separated by a semi-circular fan of windows.

213
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,810
The answer then comes down to how many times the value 

214
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,200
of this angle fits into 180 degrees, which is pi radians.

215
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,816
From here, to understand why exactly the digits of pi show up when the mass ratio is 

216
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:56,700
a power of 100, is exactly what we did in the last video, so I won't repeat myself here.

217
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,194
And finally, as we reflect now on how absurd the initial appearance of pi seemed, 

218
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:07,118
and on the two solutions we've now seen, and on how unexpectedly helpful it can be to 

219
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:10,667
represent the state of your system with points in some space, 

220
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:14,446
I leave you with this quote from the computer scientist Alan Kay, 

221
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:17,080
A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.
