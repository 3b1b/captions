1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
You know that feeling you get when you have two mirrors facing each other,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,340
and it gives the illusion of there being an infinite tunnel of rooms.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
Or, if they're at an angle with each other,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,660
it makes you feel like you're a part of a strange kaleidoscopic world with many copies of yourself,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,260
all separated by angled pieces of glass.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,160
What many people may not realize is that the idea underlying these illusions

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,060
can be surprisingly helpful for solving serious problems in math.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,560
We've already seen two videos describing the block-collision puzzle,

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,620
with its wonderfully surprising answer.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,120
Big block comes in from the bright, lots of clacks, the total number of clacks looks like pi,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,960
and we want to know why.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,960
Here, we see one more perspective explaining what's going on,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,240
where if the connection to pi wasn't surprising enough,

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,300
we add one more unexpected connection to optics.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,340
But we're doing more than just answering the same question twice.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,840
This alternate solution gives a much richer understanding of the whole setup,

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,060
and it makes it easier to answer other questions.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,860
And fun side note, it happens to be core to how I coded the accurate simulations of these blocks

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,540
without requiring absurdly small time steps and huge computation time.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,760
The solution from the last video involved a coordinate plane,

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,820
where each point encodes a pair of velocities.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,220
Here, we'll do something similar,

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,200
but the points of our plane are going to encode the pair of positions of both blocks.

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,240
Again, the idea is that by representing the state of a changing system

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,500
with individual points in some space,

26
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,300
problems in dynamics turn into problems in geometry,

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,820
which hopefully are more solvable.

28
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,820
Specifically, let the x-coordinate of a 2D plane

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,040
represent the distance from the wall to the left edge of the first block,

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,640
what I'll call d1,

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,680
and let the y-coordinate represent the distance from the wall

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,160
to the right edge of the second block, what we'll call d2.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,400
That way, the line y equals x shows us where the two blocks clack into each other,

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,940
since this happens whenever d1 is equal to d2.

35
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,320
Here's what it looks like for our scenario to play out.

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,920
As the two distances of our blocks change,

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,460
the two dimensional points of our configuration space move around,

38
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,760
with positions that always fully encode the information of those two distances.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,680
You may notice that at the bottom there, it's bounded by a line,

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,540
where d2 is the same as the small block's width,

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,400
which, if you think about it, is what it means for the small block to hit the wall.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,440
You may be able to guess where we're going with this.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,940
The way this point bounces between the two bounding lines

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,160
is a bit like a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,960
The analogy doesn't quite work, though.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,680
In the lingo of optics, the angle of incidence

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,800
doesn't equal the angle of reflection.

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,540
Just think of the first collision.

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,340
A beam of light coming in from the right would bounce off a 45 degree angled mirror,

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,420
this x equals y line, in such a way that it ends up going straight down,

51
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,400
which would mean that only the second block is moving.

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,900
This does happen in the simplest case, where the second block has the same mass as the first,

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,600
and picks up all of its momentum like a croquet ball.

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,620
But in the general case, for other mass ratios, that first block keeps much of its momentum,

55
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,580
so the trajectory of our point in this configuration space won't be pointed straight down,

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,400
it'll be down and to the left a bit.

57
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,420
And even if it's not immediately clear why this analogy with light would actually be helpful,

58
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,020
and trust me, it will be helpful in many ways,

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,140
run with me here and see if we can fix this for the general case.

60
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,700
Seeking analogies in math is very often a good idea.

61
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,140
As with the last video, it's helpful to rescale the coordinates.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
In fact, motivated by precisely what we did then,

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,580
you might think to rescale the coordinates so that x is not equal to d1,

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,980
but is equal to the square root of the first mass, m1, times d1.

65
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,140
This has the effect of stretching our space horizontally,

66
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,640
so changes in our big block's position now result in larger changes to the x-coordinate itself.

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,520
And likewise, let's write the y-coordinate as square root of m2 times d2,

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,140
even though in this particular case the second mass is 1,

69
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,600
so it doesn't make a difference, but let's keep things symmetric.

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,780
Maybe this strikes you as making things uglier, and kind of a random thing to do,

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,740
but as with last time, when we include square roots of masses like this,

72
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,100
everything plays more nicely with the laws of conserving energy and momentum.

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,940
Specifically, the conservation of energy will translate into the fact that our little point

74
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,800
in the space is always moving at the same speed,

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,540
which in our analogy you might think of meaning there's a constant speed of light,

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,140
and the conservation of momentum will translate to the fact that

77
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,920
as our point bounces off the mirrors of our setup, so to speak,

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,000
the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,340
Doesn't that seem bizarre in kind of a delightful way,

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,280
that the laws of kinematics should translate to laws of optics like this?

81
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,440
To see why it's true, let's roll up our sleeves and work out the actual math.

82
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,960
Focus on the velocity vector of our point in the diagram.

83
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,640
It shows which direction it's moving and how quickly.

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,740
Now keep in mind, this is not a physical velocity, like the velocities of the moving blocks.

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Instead, it's a more abstract rate of change in the context of this configuration space,

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,920
whose two dimensions worth of possible directions encode both velocities of the block.

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,080
The x component of this little vector is the rate of change of x,

88
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,940
and likewise its y component is the rate of change of y.

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,200
What is the rate of change for the x-coordinate?

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,540
x is the square root of m1 times d1, and the mass doesn't change,

91
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
so it depends only on how d1 changes.

92
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,420
What's the rate at which d1 changes?

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,880
Well, that's the velocity of the big block.

94
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,700
Let's call that v1.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,580
Likewise, the rate of change for y is the square root of m2 times v2.

96
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,240
Now, notice what the magnitude of our little configuration space changing vector is.

97
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,460
Using the Pythagorean theorem, it's the square root of the sum of each of these component rates

98
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:17,660
of change squared, which is square root of m1 times v1 squared plus m2 times v2 squared.

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,480
This inner expression should look awfully familiar,

100
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,420
it's exactly twice the kinetic energy of our system.

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,680
So the speed of our point in the configuration space is some function of the total energy,

102
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,240
and that stays constant throughout the whole process.

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,540
Remember, a core over-idealizing assumption to this

104
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,100
is that there's no energy lost to friction or to any of the collisions.

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
All right, so that's pretty cool.

106
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,980
With these rescaled coordinates, our little point is always moving with a constant speed.

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,680
And I know it's not obvious why you would care, but among other things,

108
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,760
it's important for the next step, where the conservation of momentum

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
implies that these two bounding lines act like mirrors.

110
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,800
First, let's understand this line d1 equals d2 a little bit better.

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,120
In our new coordinates, it's no longer that nice 45 degree x equals y line.

112
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,700
Instead, if we do a little algebraic manipulation here,

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,940
we can see that that line is x over square root m1 equals y over square root m2.

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Rearranging a little bit more, we see that's a line with a slope of square root m2 over m1.

115
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,540
That's a nice expression to tuck away in the back of your mind.

116
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,360
After the blocks collide, meaning our point hits this line,

117
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,160
the way to figure out how they move is to use the conservation of momentum,

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,920
which says that the value m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2

119
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,620
is the same both before and after the collision.

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,100
Now notice, this looks like a dot product between two column vectors, m1m2 and v1v2.

121
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,860
Rewriting it slightly for our rescaled coordinates,

122
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,580
the same thing could be written as a dot product between

123
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,380
a column vector with the square roots of the masses,

124
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,220
and one with the rates of change for x and y.

125
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,160
I know this probably seems like a complicated way to talk about a comparatively simple momentum equation,

126
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,000
but there is a good reason for shifting the language to one of dot products in our new coordinates.

127
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,380
Notice that second vector is simply the rate of change vector for the point

128
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,120
in our diagram that we've been looking at.

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,660
The key now is that this square root of the masses vector

130
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,600
points in the same direction as our collision line,

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,240
since the rise over run is square root m2 over square root of m1.

132
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,740
Now if you're unfamiliar with the dot product,

133
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,480
there is another video on this channel describing it,

134
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,040
but real quick let's go over what it means geometrically.

135
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,580
The dot product of two vectors equals the length of the first one

136
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,480
multiplied by the length of the projection of the second one onto that first,

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,840
where it's considered negative if they point in opposite directions.

138
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,960
You often see this written as the product of the lengths of the two vectors,

139
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,880
and the cosine of the angle between them.

140
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,500
So look back at this conservation of momentum expression,

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,520
telling us that the dot product between this square root of the masses vector

142
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,460
and our little change vector has to be the same, both before and after the collision.

143
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,500
Since we just saw that this change vector has a constant magnitude,

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,520
the only way for this dot product to stay the same

145
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,500
is if the angle that it makes with the collision line stays the same.

146
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,680
In other words, again using the lingo of optics,

147
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,460
the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection off this collision line must be equal.

148
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,500
Similarly, when the small block bounces off the wall,

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,680
our little vector gets reflected about the x direction, since only its y coordinate changes.

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,760
So our configuration point is bouncing off that horizontal line as if it was a mirror.

151
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,360
So step back a moment and think about what this means for our original question

152
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,680
of counting block collisions and trying to understand why on earth pi would show up.

153
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
We can translate it to a completely different question.

154
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,780
If you shine a beam of light at a pair of mirrors,

155
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,700
meeting each other at some angle, let's say theta,

156
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,780
how many times would that light bounce off of the mirrors as a function of that angle?

157
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,980
Remember, the mass ratio of our blocks determines this angle theta in the analogy.

158
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,920
Now I can hear some of you complaining,

159
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,840
haven't we just replaced one tricky setup with another?

160
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,920
This might make for a cute analogy, but how is it progress?

161
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,900
It's true that counting the number of light bounces is hard,

162
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,220
but now we have a helpful trick.

163
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,420
When the beam of light hits the mirror,

164
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,700
instead of thinking of that beam as reflected about the mirror,

165
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,500
think of the beam as going straight,

166
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,260
while the whole world gets flipped through the mirror.

167
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,620
It's as if the beam is passing through a piece of glass into an illusory looking glass universe.

168
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,060
Think of actual mirrors here.

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,820
This wire on the left will represent a laser beam coming into the mirror,

170
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,520
and the one on the right will represent its reflection.

171
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
The illusion is that the beam goes straight through the mirror,

172
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,040
as if passing through a window separating us from another room.

173
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,620
But notice, crucially, for this illusion to work,

174
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,480
the angle of incidence has to equal the angle of reflection.

175
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,240
Otherwise, the flipped copy of the reflected beam won't line up with the first part.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,500
So all of that work we did, rescaling coordinates and

177
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,520
futzing through the momentum equations, was certainly necessary.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,520
But now we get to enjoy the fruits of our labor.

179
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,560
Watch how this helps us elegantly solve the question of how many mirror bounces there will be,

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,780
which is also the question of how many block collisions there will be.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Every time the beam hits a mirror, don't think of the beam as getting reflected,

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,280
let it continue straight while the world gets reflected.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,840
As this goes on, the illusion to the beam of light is that instead of getting bounced around

184
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,580
between two angled mirrors many times, it's passing through a sequence of angled pieces

185
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,540
of glass all the same angle apart. Right now I'm showing you all of the reflected copies

186
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,140
of the bouncing trajectory, which I think has a very striking beauty to it.

187
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,940
But for a clearer view, let's just focus on the original bouncing beam and the illusory straight one.

188
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,140
The question of counting bounces turns into a question of how many pieces of glass

189
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,980
this illusory beam crosses. How many reflected copies of the world does it pass into?

190
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,940
Well, calling the angle between the mirrors theta, the answer here is however many times

191
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,300
you can add theta to itself before you get more than halfway around a circle,

192
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,380
which is to say before you add up to more than pi total radians.

193
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,620
Written as a formula, the answer to this question is the floor of pi divided by theta.

194
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,560
So let's review. We started by drawing a configuration space for our colliding blocks

195
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,640
where the x and the y coordinates represented the two distances from the wall.

196
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,560
This kind of looked like light bouncing between two mirrors, but to make the analogy work properly

197
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,060
we needed to rescale the coordinates by the square roots of the masses.

198
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,260
This made it so that the slope of one of our lines was square root of m2 divided by square root of m1,

199
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,740
so the angle between those bounding lines will be the inverse tangent of that slope.

200
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,440
To figure out how many bounces there are between two mirrors like this,

201
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,960
think of the illusion of the beam going straight through a sequence of looking glass universes

202
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,720
separated by a semi-circular fan of windows. The answer then comes down to how many times

203
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,200
the value of this angle fits into 180 degrees, which is pi radians.

204
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,000
From here, to understand why exactly the digits of pi show up when the mass ratio is a power of

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,700
100, is exactly what we did in the last video, so I won't repeat myself here.

206
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,080
And finally, as we reflect now on how absurd the initial appearance of pi seemed,

207
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,160
and on the two solutions we've now seen, and on how unexpectedly helpful it can be

208
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,800
to represent the state of your system with points in some space,

209
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,300
I leave you with this quote from the computer scientist Alan Kay,

210
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,500
A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.
