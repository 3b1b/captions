1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
One way to think about the function e to the t is to ask what properties does it have?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,020
Probably the most important one, and from some points of view the defining property, 

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,620
is that it is its own derivative.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,366
Together with the added condition that inputting 0 returns 1, 

5
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:16,740
it's actually the only function with this property.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,620
And you can illustrate what this means with a physical model.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,543
If e to the t describes your position on a number line as a function of time, 

8
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:29,313
then you start at the number 1, and what this equation is saying is your velocity, 

9
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:32,820
the derivative of position, is always equal to that position.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,000
The farther away from 0 you are, the faster you move.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,648
So even before knowing how to compute e to the t exactly, 

12
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:42,329
going from a specific time to a specific position, 

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,376
this ability to associate each position with a velocity paints a very strong 

14
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:48,900
intuitive picture of how the function must grow.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,493
You know that you'll be accelerating, and at an accelerating rate, 

16
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:55,300
with an all-around feeling of things getting out of quickly.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,229
And if you add a constant to that exponent, like e to the 2 times t, 

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,180
the chain rule tells us that the derivative is now 2 times itself.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,223
So at every point on the number line, rather than attaching a vector corresponding 

20
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:16,540
to the number itself, first double the magnitude of the position, then attach it.

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,953
Moving so that your position is always e to the 2t is the same as 

22
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:25,040
moving in such a way that your velocity is always twice your position.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,860
The implication of that too is that our runaway growth feels all the more out of control.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,065
If that constant was negative, say negative 0.5, 

25
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:40,007
then your velocity vector is always negative 0.5 times your position vector, 

26
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:44,500
meaning you flip it around 180 degrees and scale its length by a half.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,317
Moving in such a way that your velocity always matches this 

28
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,832
flipped and squished copy of your position vector, 

29
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:54,480
you'd the other direction, slowing down in an exponential decay towards 0.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,800
But what about if that constant was i, the square root of negative 1?

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,420
If your position was always e to the i t, how would you move as the time t ticks forward?

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,145
Well now the derivative of your position will always be i times itself, 

33
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:14,780
and multiplying by i has the effect of rotating numbers 90 degrees.

34
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,938
So as you might expect, things only make sense here if we 

35
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,760
start thinking beyond the number line and in the complex plane.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,096
So even before you know how to compute e to the i times t, 

37
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:29,159
you know that for any position this might give for some value of time, 

38
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,280
the velocity at that time will be a 90 degree rotation of that position.

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,372
Drawing this for all possible positions you might come across, you get a vector field, 

40
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:42,040
where as usual with vector fields you shrink things down to avoid clutter.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,605
At time t equals 0, e to the i t will be 1, that's our initial condition, 

42
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:50,762
and there's only one trajectory starting from that position where your velocity is 

43
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,467
always matching the vector that it's passing through, 

44
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,320
a 90 degree rotation of the position.

45
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,300
It's when you go around a circle of radius 1 at a speed of 1 unit per second.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,077
So after pi seconds you've traced a distance of pi around, 

47
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:07,940
so e to the i times pi should be negative 1.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,714
After tau seconds you've gone full circle, e to the i times tau equals 1, 

49
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:18,051
and more generally e to the i times t equals a number that's t 

50
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:21,700
radians around this unit circle in the complex plane.

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,343
Nevertheless, something might still feel immoral about putting an imaginary 

52
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,800
number up in that exponent, and you would be right to question that.

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,204
What we write as e to the t is a bit of notational disaster, 

54
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:43,328
giving the number e and the idea of repeated multiplication way more emphasis 

55
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,280
than they deserve.

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,020
But my time is up, so I'll spare you the full rant until the next video.
