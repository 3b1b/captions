1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
One way to think about the function e to the t is to ask what properties does it have?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,780
Probably the most important one, and from some points of view the defining property,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,400
is that it is its own derivative. Together with the added condition that inputting 0 returns 1,

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,380
it's actually the only function with this property. And you can illustrate what this

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,760
means with a physical model. If e to the t describes your position on a number line

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,800
as a function of time, then you start at the number 1, and what this equation is saying is

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,080
your velocity, the derivative of position, is always equal to that position. The farther away

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,500
from 0 you are, the faster you move. So even before knowing how to compute e to the t exactly,

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,860
going from a specific time to a specific position, this ability to associate each position with a

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,080
velocity paints a very strong intuitive picture of how the function must grow. You know that you'll

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,740
be accelerating, and at an accelerating rate, with an all-around feeling of things getting out of

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:03,400
quickly. And if you add a constant to that exponent, like e to the 2 times t,

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,080
the chain rule tells us that the derivative is now 2 times itself. So at every point on the number

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,500
line, rather than attaching a vector corresponding to the number itself, first double the magnitude

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,040
of the position, then attach it. Moving so that your position is always e to the 2t is the same

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,240
as moving in such a way that your velocity is always twice your position. The implication

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,020
of that too is that our runaway growth feels all the more out of control. If that constant was

18
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,440
negative, say negative 0.5, then your velocity vector is always negative 0.5 times your position

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,060
vector, meaning you flip it around 180 degrees and scale its length by a half. Moving in such a

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,780
way that your velocity always matches this flipped and squished copy of your position vector, you'd

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,480
the other direction, slowing down in an exponential decay towards 0.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,940
But what about if that constant was i, the square root of negative 1? If your position was always e

23
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,920
to the i t, how would you move as the time t ticks forward? Well now the derivative of your position

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,780
will always be i times itself, and multiplying by i has the effect of rotating numbers 90 degrees.

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,340
So as you might expect, things only make sense here if we start thinking beyond the number line

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,700
and in the complex plane. So even before you know how to compute e to the i times t,

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,940
you know that for any position this might give for some value of time, the velocity at that time will

28
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,400
be a 90 degree rotation of that position. Drawing this for all possible positions you might come

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,720
across, you get a vector field, where as usual with vector fields you shrink things down to avoid

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,000
clutter. At time t equals 0, e to the i t will be 1, that's our initial condition, and there's only

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,480
one trajectory starting from that position where your velocity is always matching the vector that

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,560
it's passing through, a 90 degree rotation of the position. It's when you go around a circle of

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,000
radius 1 at a speed of 1 unit per second. So after pi seconds you've traced a distance of pi around,

34
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,980
so e to the i times pi should be negative 1. After tau seconds you've gone full circle,

35
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,860
e to the i times tau equals 1, and more generally e to the i times t

36
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,700
equals a number that's t radians around this unit circle in the complex plane.

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,400
Nevertheless, something might still feel immoral about putting an imaginary number up in that

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,240
exponent, and you would be right to question that. What we write as e to the t is a bit of

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,360
notational disaster, giving the number e and the idea of repeated multiplication

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,480
way more emphasis than they deserve. But my time is up, so I'll spare you the full rant until the next video.
