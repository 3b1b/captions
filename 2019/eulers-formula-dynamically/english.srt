1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
One way to think about the function e to the t is to ask what properties does it have?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,120
Probably the most important one, and from some points of view the defining property,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,560
is that it is its own derivative. Together with the added condition that inputting 0 returns 1,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,320
it's actually the only function with this property. And you can illustrate what this

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
means with a physical model. If e to the t describes your position on a number line

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,760
as a function of time, then you start at the number 1, and what this equation is saying is

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,080
that your velocity, the derivative of position, is always equal to that position. The farther away

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,680
from 0 you are, the faster you move. So even before knowing how to compute e to the t exactly,

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,920
going from a specific time to a specific position, this ability to associate each

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,280
position with a velocity paints a very strong intuitive picture of how the function must grow.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,760
You know that you'll be accelerating, and at an accelerating rate, with an all-around feeling

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,800
of things getting out of hand quickly. And if you add a constant to that exponent, like e to the 2

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,320
times t, the chain rule tells us that the derivative is now 2 times itself. So at every

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,880
point on the number line, rather than attaching a vector corresponding to the number itself,

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,880
first double the magnitude of the position, then attach it. Moving so that your position is always

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,560
e to the 2t is the same thing as moving in such a way that your velocity is always twice your

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,840
position. The implication of that too is that our runaway growth feels all the more out of control.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,560
If that constant was negative, say negative 0.5, then your velocity vector is always negative 0.5

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,400
times your position vector, meaning you flip it around 180 degrees and scale its length by a half.

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Moving in such a way that your velocity always matches this flipped and squished copy of your

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,480
position vector, you'd go the other direction, slowing down in an exponential decay towards 0.

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,800
But what about if that constant was i, the square root of negative 1?

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,400
If your position was always e to the i t, how would you move as the time t ticks forward?

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
Well now the derivative of your position will always be i times itself,

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,560
and multiplying by i has the effect of rotating numbers 90 degrees, so as you might expect things

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
only make sense here if we start thinking beyond the number line and in the complex plane. So even

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,520
before you know how to compute e to the i times t, you know that for any position this might give for

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,200
some value of time, the velocity at that time will be a 90 degree rotation of that position.

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Drawing this for all possible positions you might come across, you get a vector field, where as usual

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,280
with vector fields you shrink things down to avoid clutter. At time t equals 0, e to the i t

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,000
will be 1, that's our initial condition, and there's only one trajectory starting from that position

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
where your velocity is always matching the vector that it's passing through, a 90 degree rotation

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,240
of the position. It's when you go around a circle of radius 1 at a speed of 1 unit per second.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,920
So after pi seconds you've traced a distance of pi around, so e to the i times pi should be negative 1.

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,520
After tau seconds you've gone full circle, e to the i times tau equals 1, and more generally

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,760
e to the i times t equals a number that's t radians around this unit circle in the complex plane.

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Nevertheless, something might still feel immoral about putting an imaginary number up in that

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,160
exponent, and you would be right to question that. What we write as e to the t is a bit of

39
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,560
a notational disaster, giving the number e and the idea of repeated multiplication

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,640
way more emphasis than they deserve. But my time is up, so I'll spare you the full rant until the next video.
