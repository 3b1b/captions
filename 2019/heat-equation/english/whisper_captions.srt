1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,900
We last left off studying the heat equation in the one-dimensional case of a rod. The

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,260
question is how the temperature distribution along such a rod will tend to change over

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,740
time. This gave us a nice first example for a partial differential equation. It told us

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,180
that the rate at which the temperature at a given point changes over time depends on

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,240
the second derivative of that temperature at that point with respect to space. Where

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,420
there's curvature in space, there's change in time.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,320
Here we're going to look at how to solve that equation. Actually, it's a little misleading

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,720
to refer to all of this as solving an equation. The PDE itself only describes one out of three

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,300
constraints that our temperature function must satisfy if it's going to accurately

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,380
describe heat flow. It must also satisfy certain boundary conditions, which is something we'll

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,760
talk about momentarily, and a certain initial condition, that is, you don't get to choose

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,540
how it looks at time t equals zero. These added constraints are really where all of

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,860
the challenge lies. There is a vast ocean of functions solving the PDE, in the sense

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,720
that when you take their partial derivatives the thing is going to be equal, and a sizable

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,240
subset of that ocean satisfies the right boundary conditions. When Joseph Fourier solved this

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,960
problem in 1822, his key contribution was to gain control of this ocean, turning all

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,520
of the right knobs and dials, so as to be able to select from it the particular solution

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,820
fitting a given initial condition. We can think of his solution as being broken down

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,360
into three fundamental observations. 1. Certain sine waves offer a really simple solution

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,420
to this equation. 2. If you know multiple solutions, the sum of these functions is also

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,560
a solution. 3. Most surprisingly, any function can be expressed as a sum of sine waves. A

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,260
pedantic mathematician might point out that there are some pathological exceptions, but

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,760
basically any distribution you would come across in practice, including discontinuous

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,200
ones, can be written as a sum of sine waves, potentially infinitely many. And if you've

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,840
ever heard of Fourier series, you've at least heard of this last idea. And if so,

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,540
maybe you've wondered, why on earth would anyone care about breaking down a function

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,140
as a sum of sine waves? Well, in many applications, sine waves are nicer to deal with than anything

28
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,540
else, and differential equations offer us a really nice context where you can see how

29
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,280
that plays out. For our heat equation, when you write a function as a sum of these waves,

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,980
the relatively clean second derivatives make it easy to solve the heat equation for each

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,900
one of them, and as you'll see, a sum of solutions to this equation gives us another

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,380
solution, and so in turn that will give us a recipe for solving the heat equation for

33
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,420
any complicated distribution as an initial state. Here, let's dig into that first step.

34
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,540
Why exactly would sine waves play nicely with the heat equation? To avoid messy constants,

35
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,580
let's start simple and say that the temperature function at time t equals 0 is simply sine

36
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,380
of x, where x describes the point on the rod. Yes, the idea of a rod's temperature just

37
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,440
happening to look like sine of x, varying around whatever temperature our conventions

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,060
arbitrarily label as 0, is clearly absurd, but in math you should always be happy to

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,440
play with examples that are idealized, potentially well beyond the point of being realistic,

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,940
because they can offer a good first step in the direction of something more general, and

41
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,960
hence more realistic.

42
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,020
The right-hand side of this heat equation asks about the second derivative of our function,

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,380
how much our temperature distribution curves as you move along space. The derivative of

44
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,900
sine of x is cosine of x, whose derivative in turn is negative sine of x. The amount

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,620
the wave curves is, in a sense, equal and opposite to its height at each point.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,200
So at least at time t equals 0, this has the peculiar effect that each point changes its

47
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,540
temperature at a rate proportional to the temperature of the point itself, with the

48
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,980
same proportionality constant across all points.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,000
So after some tiny time step, everything scales down by the same factor, and after that, it's

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,260
still the same sine curve shape, just scaled down a bit, so the same logic applies, and

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,680
the next time step would scale it down uniformly again. This applies just as well in the limit,

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,920
as the size of these time steps approaches 0. So unlike other temperature distributions,

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,940
sine waves are peculiar in that they'll get scaled down uniformly, looking like some

54
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,520
constant times sine of x for all times t.

55
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,860
Now when you see that the rate at which some value changes is proportional to that value

56
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,920
itself, your mind should burn with the thought of an exponential. And if it's not, or if

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,080
you're a little rusty on the idea of taking derivatives of exponentials, or what makes

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,900
the number e special, I'd recommend you take a look at this video. The upshot is that

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,080
the derivative of e to some constant times t is equal to that constant times itself.

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,480
If the rate at which your investment grows, for example, is always 0.05 times the total

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,060
value, then its value over time is going to look like e to the 0.05 times t times whatever

62
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,380
the initial investment was. If the rate at which the count of carbon-14 atoms in an old

63
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,160
bone changes is always equal to some negative constant times that count itself, then over

64
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,780
time that number will look approximately like e to that negative constant times t times

65
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,180
whatever the initial count was.

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,660
So when you look at our heat equation, and you know that for a sine wave, the right hand

67
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,350
side is going to be negative alpha times the temperature function itself, hopefully it

68
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,530
won't be too surprising to propose that the solution is to scale down by a factor

69
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,630
of e to the negative alpha t.

70
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,090
Here, go ahead and check the partial derivatives. The proposed function of x and t is sine of

71
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,830
x times e to the negative alpha t. Taking the second partial derivative with respect

72
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,490
to x, that e to the negative alpha t term looks like a constant, it doesn't have any

73
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,810
x in it. So it just comes along for the ride, as if it was any other constant, like 2, and

74
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,210
the first derivative with respect to x is cosine of x times e to the negative alpha

75
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,570
t. Likewise, the second partial derivative with respect to x becomes negative sine of

76
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,790
x times e to the negative alpha t.

77
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,190
And on the flip side, if you look at the partial derivative with respect to t, that sine of

78
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,030
x term now looks like a constant, since it doesn't have a t in it. So we get negative

79
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,690
alpha times e to the negative alpha t times sine of x.

80
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,210
So indeed, this function does make the partial differential equation true.

81
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,230
And oh, if it was only that simple, this narrative flow could be so nice, we would just beeline

82
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,550
directly to the delicious Fourier series conclusion. Sadly, nature is not so nice, knocking us

83
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,110
off onto an annoying but highly necessary detour.

84
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,530
Here's the thing, even if nature were to somehow produce a temperature distribution

85
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,450
on this rod, which looks like this perfect sine wave, the exponential decay is not actually

86
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,170
how it would evolve. Assuming that no heat flows in or out of the rod, here's what

87
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,150
that evolution would actually look like. The points on the left are heated up a little

88
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,050
at first, and those on the right are cooled down by their neighbors to the interior.

89
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,210
In fact, let me give you an even simpler solution to the PDE which fails to describe actual

90
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,390
heat flow, a straight line, that is, the temperature function will be some non-zero constant times

91
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,570
x, and never change over time. The second partial derivative with respect to x is indeed

92
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,130
zero, I mean there is no curvature, and its partial derivative with respect to time is

93
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,270
also zero, since it never changes over time. And yet, if I throw this into the simulator,

94
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,930
it does actually change over time, slowly approaching a uniform temperature at the mean

95
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,890
value. What's going on here is that the simulation I'm using treats the two boundary

96
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,870
points of the rod differently from how it treats all the others, which is a more accurate

97
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,230
reflection of what would actually happen in nature. If you'll recall from the last video,

98
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,090
the intuition for where that second derivative with respect to x actually came from was rooted

99
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,050
in having each point tend towards the average value of its two neighbors on either side.

100
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,490
But at the boundary, there is no neighbor to one side. If we went back to thinking of

101
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,150
the discrete version, modeling only finitely many points on this rod, you could have each

102
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,450
boundary point tend towards its one neighbor at a rate proportional to their difference.

103
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,010
As we do this for higher and higher resolutions, notice how pretty much immediately after the

104
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,190
clock starts, our distribution looks flat at either of those two boundary points. In

105
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,450
fact, in the limiting case, as these finer and finer discretized setups approach a continuous

106
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:41,010
curve, the slope of our curve at the boundary will be zero for all times after the start.

107
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,170
One way this is often described is that the slope at any given point is proportional to

108
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,030
the rate of heat flow at that point. So if you want to model the restriction that no

109
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,630
heat flows into or out of the rod, the slope at either end will be zero. That's somewhat

110
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,190
hand-wavy and incomplete, I know, so if you want the fuller details, I've left links

111
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,630
and resources in the description. Taking the example of a straight line, whose slope at

112
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,010
the boundary points is decidedly not zero, as soon as the clock starts, those boundary

113
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,810
values will shift infinitesimally such that the slope there suddenly becomes zero and

114
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,050
remains that way through the remainder of the evolution.

115
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,810
In other words, finding a function satisfying the heat equation itself is not enough. It

116
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,730
must also satisfy the property that it's flat at each of those endpoints for all times

117
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,170
greater than zero. Phrased more precisely, the partial derivative with respect to x of

118
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,730
our temperature function at 0T and at LT must be zero for all times T greater than zero,

119
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,290
where L is the length of the rod. This is an example of a boundary condition, and pretty

120
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,390
much any time you have to solve a partial differential equation in practice, there will

121
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,790
also be some boundary condition hanging along for the ride, which demands just as much attention

122
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,010
as the PDE itself. All of this may make it feel like we've gotten nowhere, but the

123
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,010
function which is a sine wave in space and an exponential decay in time actually gets

124
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,030
us quite close, we just need to tweak it a little bit so that it's flat at both endpoints.

125
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,650
First off, notice that we could just as well use a cosine function instead of a sine. I

126
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,150
mean, it's the same wave, it's just shifted in phase by a quarter of the period, which

127
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,790
would make it flat at x equals zero, as we want. The second derivative of cosine of x

128
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,130
is also negative one times itself, so for all the same reasons as before, the product

129
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,670
cosine of x times e to the negative alpha t still satisfies the PDE. To make sure that

130
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,790
it also satisfies the boundary condition on that right side, we're going to adjust the

131
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,390
frequency of the wave. However, that will affect the second derivative, since higher

132
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,730
frequency waves curve more sharply, and lower frequency ones curve more gently. Changing

133
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,930
the frequency means introducing some constant, say omega, multiplied by the input of this

134
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,430
function. A higher value of omega means the wave oscillates more quickly, since as you

135
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,250
increase x, the input to the cosine increases more rapidly.

136
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,970
Taking the derivative with respect to x, we still get negative sine, but the chain rule

137
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,010
tells us to multiply that omega on the outside, and similarly the second derivative will still

138
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:16,070
be negative cosine, but now with omega squared. This means that the right hand side of our

139
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,490
equation has now picked up this omega squared term. So to balance things out, on the left

140
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,810
hand side, the exponential decay part should have an additional omega squared term up top.

141
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,230
Unpacking what that actually means should feel intuitive. For a temperature function

142
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,170
filled with sharper curves, it decays more quickly towards an equilibrium, and evidently

143
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,510
does this quadratically. For instance, doubling the frequency results in an exponential decay

144
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:50,310
four times as fast. If the length of the rod is L, then the lowest frequency, where that

145
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,870
rightmost point of the distribution will be flat, is when omega is equal to pi divided

146
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:01,970
by L. You see that way, as x increases up to the value L, the input of our cosine expression

147
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,890
goes up to pi, which is half the period of a cosine wave. Finding all the other frequencies

148
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,030
which satisfy this boundary condition is sort of like finding harmonics, you essentially

149
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:19,130
go through all the whole number multiples of this base frequency, pi over L. In fact,

150
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,010
even multiplying it by zero works, since that gives us a constant function, which is indeed

151
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,750
a valid solution, boundary condition and all. And with that, we're off the bumpy boundary

152
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,150
condition detour and back onto the freeway. Moving forward, we're equipped with an infinite

153
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:39,590
family of functions satisfying both the PDE and the pesky boundary condition. Things are

154
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,630
definitely looking more intricate now, but it all stems from the one basic observation

155
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,070
that a function which looks like a sine curve in space and an exponential decay in time

156
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,790
fits this equation, relating second derivatives in space with first derivatives in time. And

157
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,630
of course, your formulas should start to look more intricate, you're solving a genuinely

158
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,710
hard problem. This actually makes for a pretty good stopping point, so let's call it an

159
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,930
end here, and in the next video, we'll look at how to use this infinite family to construct

160
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,910
a more general solution. To any of you worried about dwelling too much on a single example

161
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,030
in a series that's meant to give a general overview of differential equations, it's

162
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,250
worth emphasizing that many of the considerations which pop up here are frequent themes throughout

163
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,890
the field. First off, the fact that we modeled the boundary with its own special rule, while

164
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,830
the main differential equation only characterized the interior, is a very regular theme, and

165
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,910
a pattern well worth getting used to, especially in the context of PDEs. Also, take note of

166
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,610
how what we're doing is breaking down a general situation into simpler idealized cases.

167
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,090
This strategy comes up all the time, and it's actually quite common for these simpler cases

168
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,610
to look like some mixture of sine curves and exponentials that's not at all unique to

169
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,430
the heat equation, and as time goes on, we're going to get a deeper feel for why that's

170
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,650
true.
