1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
We last left off studying the heat equation in the one-dimensional case of a rod.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,290
The question is how the temperature distribution 

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,680
along such a rod will tend to change over time.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,480
This gave us a nice first example for a partial differential equation.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,691
It told us that the rate at which the temperature at a given point changes over time 

6
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:27,540
depends on the second derivative of that temperature at that point with respect to space.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,420
Where there's curvature in space, there's change in time.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,340
Here we're going to look at how to solve that equation.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,660
Actually, it's a little misleading to refer to all of this as solving an equation.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,378
The PDE itself only describes one out of three constraints that our 

11
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:45,260
temperature function must satisfy if it's going to accurately describe heat flow.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,110
It must also satisfy certain boundary conditions, 

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,160
which is something we'll talk about momentarily, and a certain initial condition, 

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,520
that is, you don't get to choose how it looks at time t equals zero.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,600
These added constraints are really where all of the challenge lies.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,891
There is a vast ocean of functions solving the PDE, 

17
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:08,445
in the sense that when you take their partial derivatives the thing is going to be equal, 

18
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:12,240
and a sizable subset of that ocean satisfies the right boundary conditions.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,536
When Joseph Fourier solved this problem in 1822, 

20
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,710
his key contribution was to gain control of this ocean, 

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,300
turning all of the right knobs and dials, so as to be able to select from it the 

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,360
particular solution fitting a given initial condition.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,800
We can think of his solution as being broken down into three fundamental observations.

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,720
1.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,120
Certain sine waves offer a really simple solution to this equation.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,200
2.

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,000
If you know multiple solutions, the sum of these functions is also a solution.

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,100
3.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,380
Most surprisingly, any function can be expressed as a sum of sine waves.

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,171
A pedantic mathematician might point out that there are some pathological exceptions, 

31
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:57,094
but basically any distribution you would come across in practice, 

32
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:01,195
including discontinuous ones, can be written as a sum of sine waves, 

33
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,860
potentially infinitely many.

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,740
And if you've ever heard of Fourier series, you've at least heard of this last idea.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,002
And if so, maybe you've wondered, why on earth would anyone 

36
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,680
care about breaking down a function as a sum of sine waves?

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,577
Well, in many applications, sine waves are nicer to deal with than anything else, 

38
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:22,928
and differential equations offer us a really nice context where you can see how that 

39
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:23,440
plays out.

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,674
For our heat equation, when you write a function as a sum of these waves, 

41
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:31,906
the relatively clean second derivatives make it easy to solve the heat equation 

42
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:35,979
for each one of them, and as you'll see, a sum of solutions to this equation 

43
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,841
gives us another solution, and so in turn that will give us a recipe for 

44
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:44,020
solving the heat equation for any complicated distribution as an initial state.

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,420
Here, let's dig into that first step.

46
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,720
Why exactly would sine waves play nicely with the heat equation?

47
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,845
To avoid messy constants, let's start simple and say that the temperature function 

48
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:59,020
at time t equals 0 is simply sine of x, where x describes the point on the rod.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,237
Yes, the idea of a rod's temperature just happening to look like sine of x, 

50
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:07,975
varying around whatever temperature our conventions arbitrarily label as 0, 

51
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:12,156
is clearly absurd, but in math you should always be happy to play with examples that 

52
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:15,549
are idealized, potentially well beyond the point of being realistic, 

53
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,730
because they can offer a good first step in the direction of something more general, 

54
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,960
and hence more realistic.

55
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,710
The right-hand side of this heat equation asks about the second derivative of 

56
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,680
our function, how much our temperature distribution curves as you move along space.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,698
The derivative of sine of x is cosine of x, whose 

58
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:37,240
derivative in turn is negative sine of x.

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,620
The amount the wave curves is, in a sense, equal and opposite to its height at each point.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,147
So at least at time t equals 0, this has the peculiar effect that each 

61
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:52,907
point changes its temperature at a rate proportional to the temperature 

62
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,980
of the point itself, with the same proportionality constant across all points.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,264
So after some tiny time step, everything scales down by the same factor, 

64
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:06,628
and after that, it's still the same sine curve shape, just scaled down a bit, 

65
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:11,440
so the same logic applies, and the next time step would scale it down uniformly again.

66
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
This applies just as well in the limit, as the size of these time steps approaches 0.

67
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,624
So unlike other temperature distributions, sine waves are peculiar in that they'll 

68
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:26,520
get scaled down uniformly, looking like some constant times sine of x for all times t.

69
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,220
Now when you see that the rate at which some value changes is proportional to 

70
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,080
that value itself, your mind should burn with the thought of an exponential.

71
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,737
And if it's not, or if you're a little rusty on the idea of taking derivatives of 

72
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:44,175
exponentials, or what makes the number e special, 

73
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,320
I'd recommend you take a look at this video.

74
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,154
The upshot is that the derivative of e to some 

75
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:54,080
constant times t is equal to that constant times itself.

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,362
If the rate at which your investment grows, for example, 

77
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:03,835
is always 0.05 times the total value, then its value over time is 

78
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:09,460
going to look like e to the 0.05 times t times whatever the initial investment was.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,353
If the rate at which the count of carbon-14 atoms in an old bone changes is always equal 

80
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:18,420
to some negative constant times that count itself, 

81
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,834
then over time that number will look approximately like e to that negative constant times 

82
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,180
t times whatever the initial count was.

83
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,519
So when you look at our heat equation, and you know that for a sine wave, 

84
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,162
the right hand side is going to be negative alpha times the temperature function itself, 

85
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:39,917
hopefully it won't be too surprising to propose that the solution is to 

86
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,630
scale down by a factor of e to the negative alpha t.

87
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,650
Here, go ahead and check the partial derivatives.

88
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,250
The proposed function of x and t is sine of x times e to the negative alpha t.

89
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,720
Taking the second partial derivative with respect to x, 

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,210
that e to the negative alpha t term looks like a constant, it doesn't have any x in it.

91
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,644
So it just comes along for the ride, as if it was any other constant, like 2, 

92
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:09,530
and the first derivative with respect to x is cosine of x times e to the negative alpha t.

93
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,471
Likewise, the second partial derivative with respect to x 

94
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:16,790
becomes negative sine of x times e to the negative alpha t.

95
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,760
And on the flip side, if you look at the partial derivative with respect to t, 

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,790
that sine of x term now looks like a constant, since it doesn't have a t in it.

97
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,690
So we get negative alpha times e to the negative alpha t times sine of x.

98
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,210
So indeed, this function does make the partial differential equation true.

99
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,120
And oh, if it was only that simple, this narrative flow could be so nice, 

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,690
we would just beeline directly to the delicious Fourier series conclusion.

101
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,647
Sadly, nature is not so nice, knocking us off 

102
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:49,110
onto an annoying but highly necessary detour.

103
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,715
Here's the thing, even if nature were to somehow produce a 

104
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:56,552
temperature distribution on this rod, which looks like this perfect sine wave, 

105
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:59,370
the exponential decay is not actually how it would evolve.

106
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,411
Assuming that no heat flows in or out of the rod, 

107
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,910
here's what that evolution would actually look like.

108
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,714
The points on the left are heated up a little at first, 

109
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:11,050
and those on the right are cooled down by their neighbors to the interior.

110
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,313
In fact, let me give you an even simpler solution to the PDE which fails 

111
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:19,369
to describe actual heat flow, a straight line, that is, 

112
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,916
the temperature function will be some non-zero constant times x, 

113
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,390
and never change over time.

114
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,089
The second partial derivative with respect to x is indeed zero, 

115
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:31,363
I mean there is no curvature, and its partial derivative with 

116
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:34,690
respect to time is also zero, since it never changes over time.

117
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,364
And yet, if I throw this into the simulator, it does actually change over time, 

118
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:43,370
slowly approaching a uniform temperature at the mean value.

119
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,385
What's going on here is that the simulation I'm using treats the two 

120
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,554
boundary points of the rod differently from how it treats all the others, 

121
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,810
which is a more accurate reflection of what would actually happen in nature.

122
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,453
If you'll recall from the last video, the intuition for where that second 

123
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:02,277
derivative with respect to x actually came from was rooted in having each 

124
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:06,050
point tend towards the average value of its two neighbors on either side.

125
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,070
But at the boundary, there is no neighbor to one side.

126
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,836
If we went back to thinking of the discrete version, 

127
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,179
modeling only finitely many points on this rod, 

128
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:17,497
you could have each boundary point tend towards its one neighbor at 

129
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,450
a rate proportional to their difference.

130
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,902
As we do this for higher and higher resolutions, 

131
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,519
notice how pretty much immediately after the clock starts, 

132
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,490
our distribution looks flat at either of those two boundary points.

133
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,307
In fact, in the limiting case, as these finer and finer 

134
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:36,151
discretized setups approach a continuous curve, 

135
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:41,010
the slope of our curve at the boundary will be zero for all times after the start.

136
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,822
One way this is often described is that the slope at any given 

137
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:49,010
point is proportional to the rate of heat flow at that point.

138
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,321
So if you want to model the restriction that no heat flows into or out of the rod, 

139
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,190
the slope at either end will be zero.

140
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,199
That's somewhat hand-wavy and incomplete, I know, 

141
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,610
so if you want the fuller details, I've left links and resources in the description.

142
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,669
Taking the example of a straight line, whose slope at the boundary 

143
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:09,505
points is decidedly not zero, as soon as the clock starts, 

144
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:12,821
those boundary values will shift infinitesimally such that the slope 

145
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:17,050
there suddenly becomes zero and remains that way through the remainder of the evolution.

146
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,510
In other words, finding a function satisfying the heat equation itself is not enough.

147
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,519
It must also satisfy the property that it's flat at 

148
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,610
each of those endpoints for all times greater than zero.

149
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,508
Phrased more precisely, the partial derivative with respect to 

150
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:36,487
x of our temperature function at 0T and at LT must be zero for 

151
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:40,530
all times T greater than zero, where L is the length of the rod.

152
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,693
This is an example of a boundary condition, and pretty much any time you have to solve 

153
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:50,086
a partial differential equation in practice, there will also be some boundary condition 

154
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:54,230
hanging along for the ride, which demands just as much attention as the PDE itself.

155
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,642
All of this may make it feel like we've gotten nowhere, 

156
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:01,289
but the function which is a sine wave in space and an exponential decay in time 

157
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:04,981
actually gets us quite close, we just need to tweak it a little bit so that it's 

158
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,030
flat at both endpoints.

159
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,230
First off, notice that we could just as well use a cosine function instead of a sine.

160
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,759
I mean, it's the same wave, it's just shifted in phase by a quarter of the period, 

161
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,550
which would make it flat at x equals zero, as we want.

162
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,706
The second derivative of cosine of x is also negative one times itself, 

163
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,657
so for all the same reasons as before, the product cosine of x 

164
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:31,170
times e to the negative alpha t still satisfies the PDE.

165
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,687
To make sure that it also satisfies the boundary condition on that right side, 

166
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,910
we're going to adjust the frequency of the wave.

167
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,980
However, that will affect the second derivative, 

168
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,691
since higher frequency waves curve more sharply, 

169
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:46,070
and lower frequency ones curve more gently.

170
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,496
Changing the frequency means introducing some constant, 

171
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,270
say omega, multiplied by the input of this function.

172
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,279
A higher value of omega means the wave oscillates more quickly, 

173
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,250
since as you increase x, the input to the cosine increases more rapidly.

174
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,338
Taking the derivative with respect to x, we still get negative sine, 

175
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:08,763
but the chain rule tells us to multiply that omega on the outside, 

176
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:12,189
and similarly the second derivative will still be negative cosine, 

177
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,570
but now with omega squared.

178
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,926
This means that the right hand side of our equation 

179
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,910
has now picked up this omega squared term.

180
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,650
So to balance things out, on the left hand side, 

181
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,810
the exponential decay part should have an additional omega squared term up top.

182
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,790
Unpacking what that actually means should feel intuitive.

183
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,174
For a temperature function filled with sharper curves, 

184
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:37,570
it decays more quickly towards an equilibrium, and evidently does this quadratically.

185
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,110
For instance, doubling the frequency results in an exponential decay four times as fast.

186
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,677
If the length of the rod is L, then the lowest frequency, 

187
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:53,072
where that rightmost point of the distribution will be flat, 

188
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,410
is when omega is equal to pi divided by L.

189
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,171
You see that way, as x increases up to the value L, 

190
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:03,018
the input of our cosine expression goes up to pi, 

191
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,410
which is half the period of a cosine wave.

192
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,492
Finding all the other frequencies which satisfy this boundary 

193
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:12,406
condition is sort of like finding harmonics, you essentially go 

194
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:15,730
through all the whole number multiples of this base frequency, pi over L.

195
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,011
In fact, even multiplying it by zero works, since that gives us a constant function, 

196
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:26,270
which is indeed a valid solution, boundary condition and all.

197
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,770
And with that, we're off the bumpy boundary condition detour and back onto the freeway.

198
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,235
Moving forward, we're equipped with an infinite family of 

199
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:37,730
functions satisfying both the PDE and the pesky boundary condition.

200
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,567
Things are definitely looking more intricate now, 

201
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,981
but it all stems from the one basic observation that a function which 

202
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,174
looks like a sine curve in space and an exponential decay in time fits this equation, 

203
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:52,490
relating second derivatives in space with first derivatives in time.

204
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,603
And of course, your formulas should start to look more intricate, 

205
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:58,430
you're solving a genuinely hard problem.

206
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,392
This actually makes for a pretty good stopping point, 

207
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,612
so let's call it an end here, and in the next video, 

208
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:07,090
we'll look at how to use this infinite family to construct a more general solution.

209
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,010
To any of you worried about dwelling too much on a single example in a series that's 

210
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,679
meant to give a general overview of differential equations, 

211
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:18,504
it's worth emphasizing that many of the considerations which pop up here are frequent 

212
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,750
themes throughout the field.

213
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,970
First off, the fact that we modeled the boundary with its own special rule, 

214
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,433
while the main differential equation only characterized the interior, 

215
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,747
is a very regular theme, and a pattern well worth getting used to, 

216
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:32,430
especially in the context of PDEs.

217
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,706
Also, take note of how what we're doing is breaking 

218
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,610
down a general situation into simpler idealized cases.

219
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,231
This strategy comes up all the time, and it's actually quite common 

220
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:45,176
for these simpler cases to look like some mixture of sine curves 

221
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:48,076
and exponentials that's not at all unique to the heat equation, 

222
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:51,430
and as time goes on, we're going to get a deeper feel for why that's true.
