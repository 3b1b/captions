1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
We last left off studying the heat equation in the one-dimensional case of a rod. The

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,240
question is how the temperature distribution along such a rod will tend to change over

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,640
time. This gave us a nice first example for a partial differential equation. It told us

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,140
that the rate at which the temperature at a given point changes over time depends on

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,200
the second derivative of that temperature at that point with respect to space. Where

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,440
there's curvature in space, there's change in time.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,340
Here we're going to look at how to solve that equation. Actually, it's a little misleading

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,640
to refer to all of this as solving an equation. The PDE itself only describes one out of three

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,660
constraints that a temperature function must satisfy if it's going to accurately describe

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,480
heat flow. It must also satisfy certain boundary conditions, which is something we'll talk

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,000
about momentarily, and a certain initial condition, that is, you don't get to choose how it

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,440
looks at time t equals 0. These added constraints are really where all of the challenge lies.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,540
There is a vast ocean of functions solving the PDE, in the sense that when you take their

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,380
partial derivatives the thing is going to be equal, and a sizable subset of that ocean

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,160
satisfies the right boundary conditions. When Joseph Fourier solved this problem in 1822,

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,780
his key contribution was to gain control of this ocean, turning all the right knobs and

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,280
dials so as to be able to select from it the particular solution fitting a given initial

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,500
condition. We can think of his solution as being broken down into three fundamental observations.

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,700
Number one, certain sine waves offer a really simple solution to this equation. Number two,

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,980
if you know multiple solutions, the sum of these functions is also a solution. And number

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,420
three, most surprisingly, any function can be expressed as a sum of sine waves. Well,

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,380
a pedantic mathematician might point out that there are some pathological exceptions, but

23
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,940
basically any distribution you would come across in practice, including discontinuous

24
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,220
ones, can be written as a sum of sine waves, potentially infinitely many. And if you've

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,280
ever heard of Fourier series, you've at least heard of this last idea. And if so,

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,540
maybe you've wondered, why on earth would anyone care about breaking down a function

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,100
as a sum of sine waves? Well, in many applications, sine waves are nicer to deal with than anything

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,420
else, and differential equations offer us a really nice context where you can see how

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,740
that plays out. For our heat equation, when you write a function as a sum of these waves,

30
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,900
the relatively clean second derivatives make it easy to solve the heat equation for each

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,340
one of them. And, as you'll see, a sum of solutions to this equation gives us another

32
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,260
solution, and so in turn that will give us a recipe for solving the heat equation for

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,460
any complicated distribution as an initial state.

34
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,020
Here, let's dig into that first step. Why exactly would sine waves play nicely with

35
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,400
the heat equation? To avoid messy constants, let's start simple and say that the temperature

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,740
function at time t equals 0 is simply sine of x, where x describes the point on the rod.

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,580
Yes, the idea of a rod's temperature just happening to look like sine of x, varying

38
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,400
around whatever temperature our conventions arbitrarily label as 0, is clearly absurd.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,440
But in math, you should always be happy to play with examples that are idealized, potentially

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,840
well beyond the point of being realistic, because they can offer a good first step in

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,040
the direction of something more general, and hence more realistic.

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
The right-hand side of this heat equation asks about the second derivative of our function,

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,300
how much our temperature distribution curves as you move along space. The derivative of

44
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,900
sine of x is cosine of x, whose derivative in turn is negative sine of x. The amount

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,780
the wave curves is, in a sense, equal and opposite to its height at each point.

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,960
So at least at the time t equals 0, this has the peculiar effect that each point changes

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,340
its temperature at a rate proportional to the temperature of the point itself, with

48
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,220
the same proportionality constant across all points.

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,980
So after some tiny time step, everything scales down by the same factor. And after that, it's

50
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,260
still the same sine curve shape, just scaled down a bit, so the same logic applies, and

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,340
the next time step would scale it down uniformly again. And this applies just as well in the

52
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,460
limit, as the size of these time steps approaches 0. So unlike other temperature distributions,

53
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,860
sine waves are peculiar in that they'll get scaled down uniformly, looking like some

54
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,680
constant times sine of x for all times t.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,800
Now when you see that the rate at which some value changes is proportional to that value

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,840
itself, your mind should burn with the thought of an exponential. And if it's not, or if

57
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,040
you're a little rusty on the idea of taking derivatives of exponentials, or what makes

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,760
the number e special, I'd recommend you take a look at this video. The upshot is that

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,720
the derivative of e to some constant times t is equal to that constant times itself.

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,400
If the rate at which your investment grows, for example, is always 0.05 times the total

61
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,040
value, then its value over time is going to look like e to the 0.05 times t times whatever

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,320
the initial investment was. If the rate at which the count of carbon-14 atoms in an old

63
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,080
bone changes is always equal to some negative constant times that count itself, then over

64
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,720
time that number will look approximately like e to that negative constant times t times

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
whatever the initial count was.

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,640
So when you look at our heat equation, and you know that for a sine wave, the right hand

67
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,120
side is going to be negative alpha times the temperature function itself, hopefully it

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,840
wouldn't be too surprising to propose that the solution is to scale down by a factor

69
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,440
of e to the negative alpha t.

70
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Here, go ahead and check the partial derivatives. The proposed function of x and t is sine of

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,840
x times e to the negative alpha t. Taking the second partial derivative with respect

72
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,400
to x, that e to the negative alpha t term looks like a constant, it doesn't have any

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,800
x in it. So it just comes along for the ride, as if it was any other constant, like 2, and

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,160
the first derivative with respect to x is cosine of x times e to the negative alpha

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,480
t. Likewise, the second partial derivative with respect to x becomes negative sine of

76
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,800
x times e to the negative alpha t.

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,160
And on the flip side, if you look at the partial derivative with respect to t, that sine of

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,040
x term now looks like a constant, since it doesn't have a t in it, so we get negative

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,320
alpha times e to the negative alpha t times sine of x. So indeed, this function does make

80
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,600
the partial differential equation true.

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,160
And oh, if it was only that simple, this narrative flow could be so nice, we would just beeline

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,460
directly to the delicious Fourier series conclusion. Sadly, nature is not so nice, knocking us

83
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,160
off onto an annoying but highly necessary detour. Here's the thing, even if nature

84
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,680
were to somehow produce a temperature distribution on this rod, which looks like this perfect

85
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,880
sine wave, the exponential decay is not actually how it would evolve. Assuming that no heat

86
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,320
flows in or out of the rod, here's what that evolution would actually look like. The

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,240
points on the left are heated up a little at first, and those on the right are cooled

88
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,540
down by their neighbors to the interior.

89
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,160
In fact, let me give you an even simpler solution to the PDE, which fails to describe actual

90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,520
heat flow, a straight line, that is, the temperature function will be some non-zero

91
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,400
constant times x and never change over time. The second partial derivative with respect

92
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,360
to x is indeed zero, I mean there is no curvature, and its partial derivative with respect to

93
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,360
time is also zero, since it never changes over time.

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,920
And yet, if I throw this into the simulator, it does actually change over time, slowly

95
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,760
approaching a uniform temperature at the mean value. What's going on here is that the

96
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,880
simulation I'm using treats the two boundary points of the rod differently from how it

97
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,400
treats all the others, which is a more accurate reflection of what would actually happen in

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,520
nature. If you'll recall from the last video, the intuition for where that second derivative

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,520
with respect to x actually came from was rooted in having each point tend towards the average

100
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,280
value of its two neighbors on either side. But at the boundary, there is no neighbor

101
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,700
to one side. If we went back to thinking of the discrete version, modeling only finitely

102
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,700
many points on this rod, you could have each boundary point tend towards its one neighbor

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,020
at a rate proportional to their difference. As we do this for higher and higher resolutions,

104
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,980
notice how pretty much immediately after the clock starts, our distribution looks flat

105
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,660
at either of those two boundary points. In fact, in the limiting case, as these finer

106
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,480
and finer discretized setups approach a continuous curve, the slope of our curve at the boundary

107
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,560
will be zero for all times after the start. One way this is often described is that the

108
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,320
slope at any given point is proportional to the rate of heat flow at that point. So if

109
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,680
you want to model the restriction that no heat flows into or out of the rod, the slope

110
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,600
at either end will be zero. That's somewhat hand-wavy and incomplete, I know, so if you

111
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,800
want the fuller details, I've left links and resources in the description. Taking the

112
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,120
example of a straight line, whose slope at the boundary points is decidedly not zero,

113
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,560
as soon as the clock starts, those boundary values will shift infinitesimally such that

114
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,440
the slope there suddenly becomes zero and remains that way through the remainder of

115
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,240
the evolution. In other words, finding a function satisfying the heat equation itself is not

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,920
enough. It must also satisfy the property that it's flat at each of those endpoints

117
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,280
for all times greater than zero. Phrased more precisely, the partial derivative with respect

118
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,200
to x of our temperature function at 0T and at LT must be zero for all times T greater

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,080
than zero, where L is the length of the rod. This is an example of a boundary condition,

120
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,200
and pretty much any time you have to solve a partial differential equation in practice,

121
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,760
there will also be some boundary condition hanging along for the ride, which demands

122
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,880
just as much attention as the PDE itself. All of this may make it feel like we've

123
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
gotten nowhere, but the function which is a sine wave in space and an exponential decay

124
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,840
in time actually gets us quite close. We just need to tweak it a little bit so that it's

125
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,160
flat at both endpoints. First off, notice that we could just as well

126
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,900
use a cosine function instead of a sine. I mean, it's the same wave, it's just shifted

127
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,240
in phase by a quarter of the period, which would make it flat at x equals zero, as we

128
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,840
want. The second derivative of cosine of x is also negative one times itself, so for

129
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,720
all the same reasons as before, the product cosine of x times e to the negative alpha

130
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,200
t still satisfies the PDE. To make sure that it also satisfies the boundary

131
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,960
condition on that right side, we're going to adjust the frequency of the wave. However,

132
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,840
that will affect the second derivative, since higher frequency waves curve more sharply,

133
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,400
and lower frequency waves curve more gently. Changing the frequency means introducing some

134
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,200
constant, say omega, multiplied by the input of this function. A higher value of omega

135
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,060
means the wave oscillates more quickly, since as you increase x, the input to the cosine

136
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,000
increases more rapidly. Taking the derivative with respect to x, we

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,960
still get negative sine, but the chain rule tells us to multiply that omega on the outside,

138
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,620
and similarly the second derivative will still be negative cosine, but now with omega squared.

139
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,560
This means that the right-hand side of our equation has now picked up this omega squared

140
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,180
term. So to balance things out on the left-hand side, the exponential decay part should have

141
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,060
an additional omega squared term up top. Unpacking what that actually means should

142
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,540
feel intuitive. For a temperature function filled with sharper curves, it decays more

143
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,980
quickly towards an equilibrium, and evidently it does this quadratically. For instance,

144
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:46,840
doubling the frequency results in an exponential decay four times as fast.

145
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,140
If the length of the rod is L, then the lowest frequency, where that rightmost point of the

146
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:58,520
distribution will be flat, is when omega is equal to pi divided by L. You see, as x

147
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,400
increases up to the value L, the input of our cosine expression goes up to pi, which

148
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,500
is half the period of a cosine wave. Finding all the other frequencies which satisfy

149
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,540
this boundary condition is sort of like finding harmonics, you essentially go through all

150
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:20,100
the whole number multiples of this base frequency, pi over L. In fact, even multiplying it by

151
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,180
zero works, since that gives us a constant function, which is indeed a valid solution,

152
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,700
boundary condition and all. And with that, we're off the bumpy boundary condition detour

153
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,540
and back onto the freeway. Moving forward, we're equipped with an infinite family of

154
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,380
functions satisfying both the PDE and the pesky boundary condition.

155
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,800
Things are definitely looking more intricate now, but it all stems from the one basic observation

156
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,180
that a function which looks like a sine curve in space and an exponential decay in time

157
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,780
fits this equation, relating second derivatives in space with first derivatives in time.

158
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,020
And of course, your formulas should start to look more intricate, you're solving a

159
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,420
genuinely hard problem. This actually makes for a pretty good stopping point, so let's

160
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,380
call it an end here, and in the next video we'll look at how to use this infinite family

161
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,940
to construct a more general solution. To any of you worried about dwelling too much

162
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,580
on a single example in a series meant to give a general overview of differential equations,

163
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,660
it's worth emphasizing that many of the considerations which pop up here are frequent

164
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,560
themes throughout the field. First off, the fact that we modeled the boundary with its

165
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,300
own special rule, while the main differential equation only characterized the interior,

166
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,660
is a very regular theme, and a pattern well worth getting used to, especially in the context

167
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,840
of PDEs. Also, take note of how what we're doing is breaking down a general situation

168
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,620
into simpler idealized cases. This strategy comes up all the time, and it's actually

169
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,140
quite common for these simpler cases to look like some mixture of sine curves and exponentials,

170
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,980
that's not at all unique to the heat equation, and as time goes on we're going to get a

171
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,980
deeper feel for why that's true.
