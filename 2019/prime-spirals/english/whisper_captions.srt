1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,340
I first saw this pattern that I'm about to show you in a question on the Math Stack Exchange.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,620
It was asked by a user under the name Dwymark, and answered by Greg Martin, and it relates

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,620
to the distribution of prime numbers, together with rational approximations for pi.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,020
You see, what the user had been doing was playing around with data in polar coordinates.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,040
As a quick reminder so we're all on the same page, this means labeling points in 2D space

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,920
not with the usual xy coordinates, but instead with a distance from the origin, commonly

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,120
called r for radius, together with the angle that radial line makes with the horizontal,

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,600
commonly called theta.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,020
For our purposes, this angle will be measured in radians, which basically means that an

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,000
angle of pi is halfway around, and 2 pi is a full circle.

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,260
Notice, polar coordinates are not unique, in the sense that adding 2 pi to that second

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,380
coordinate doesn't change the location that this pair of numbers is referring to.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,120
The pattern that we'll look at centers around plotting points where both of these coordinates

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,720
are a given prime number.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,200
There is no practical reason to do this, it's purely fun, we're just frolicking around

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,000
in the playground of data visualization.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,100
To get a sense for what it means, look at all the whole numbers, rather than just the

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,400
primes.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,200
The point 1,1 sets a distance 1 away from the origin, with an angle of 1 radian, which

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,940
actually means this arc is the same length as that radial line.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,520
And then 2,2 has twice that angle, and twice the distance.

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,000
And to get to 3,3, you rotate one more radian, with a total angle that's now slightly less

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,460
than a half turn, since 3 is slightly less than pi, and you step one unit farther away

24
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,080
from the origin.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
I really want you to make sure that it's clear what's being plotted, because everything

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,300
that follows depends on understanding it.

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,140
Each step forward is like the tip of a clock hand, which rotates one radian with each tick

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,200
a little less than a sixth of a turn, and it grows by one unit at each step.

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,820
As you continue, these points spiral outwards, forming what's known in the business as

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,060
an archimedean spiral.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,660
Now if you make the admittedly arbitrary move to knock out everything except the prime numbers,

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,620
it initially looks quite random, after all, primes are famous for their chaotic and difficult

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,520
to predict behavior.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:25,420
But when you zoom out, what you start to see are these very clear galactic-seeming spirals,

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,880
and what's weird is some of the arms seem to be missing.

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:43,820
And zooming out even further, those spirals give way to a different pattern, these many

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,500
different outward-pointing rays.

38
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,720
And those rays seem to mostly come in clumps of four, but there's the occasional gap,

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,640
like a comb missing its teeth.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,380
The question for you and me, naturally, is what on earth is going on here?

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,800
Where do these spirals come from, and why do we instead get straight lines at this larger

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,160
scale?

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,360
If you wanted, you could ask a more quantitative question, and count that there are 20 total

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,920
spirals, and then up at that larger scale, if you patiently went through each ray, you'd

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
count up a total of 280.

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,360
And so this adds a further mystery of where these numbers are coming from, and why they

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
would arise from primes.

48
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,020
Now this is shocking, and beautiful, and you might think that it suggests some divine hidden

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,260
symmetry within the primes.

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,800
But to steady your expectations, I should say that the fact that the person asking this

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,400
question jumped right into prime numbers makes the puzzle a little misleading.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:51,160
If you look at all the whole numbers, not just the primes, as you zoom out, you see

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
very similar spirals.

54
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,660
They're much cleaner, and now there's 44 of them instead of 20, but it means that

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,540
the question of where the spirals come from is, perhaps disappointingly, completely separate

56
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,080
from the question of what happens when we limit our view to primes.

57
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,420
But don't be too disappointed, because both these questions are still phenomenal puzzles.

58
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,820
There's a very satisfying answer for the spirals, and even if the primes don't cause

59
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,740
the spirals, asking what goes on when you filter for those primes does lead you to one

60
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,200
of the most important theorems about the distribution of prime numbers, known in number theory as

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,120
Dirichlet's theorem.

62
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,460
To kick things off, let's zoom back in a little bit smaller.

63
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,640
Did you notice that as we were zooming out, there were these six little spirals?

64
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,780
This offers a good starting point to explain what's happening in the two larger patterns.

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,020
Notice how all the multiples of 6 form one arm of this spiral.

66
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,040
Then the next one is every integer that's one above a multiple of 6.

67
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,080
Then after that it includes all the numbers 2 above a multiple of 6, and so on.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,260
Why is that?

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,260
Well, remember that each step forward in this sequence involves a turn of one radian, so

70
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,620
when you count up by 6, you've turned a total of 6 radians, which is a little less

71
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,400
than 2 pi, a full turn.

72
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,300
So every time you count up by 6, you've almost made a full turn, it's just a little

73
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,660
less.

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,820
Another six steps, a slightly smaller angle.

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,580
Six more steps, smaller still, and so on, with this angle changing gently enough that

76
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,140
it gives the illusion of a single curving line.

77
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,300
When you limit the view to prime numbers, all but two of these spiral arms will go away.

78
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,980
And think about it, a prime number can't be a multiple of 6, and it also can't be

79
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,980
2 above a multiple of 6 unless it's 2, or 4 above a multiple of 6, since all of those

80
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,800
are even numbers.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,160
It also can't be 3 above a multiple of 6, unless it's the number 3 itself, since all

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,680
of those are divisible by 3.

83
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,440
So, at least at this smaller scale, nothing magical is going on.

84
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,980
And while we're in this simpler context, let me introduce some terminology that mathematicians

85
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,280
use.

86
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,560
Each one of these sequences, where you're counting up by 6, is fancifully called a residue

87
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,740
class mod 6.

88
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,660
The word residue here is sort of an overdramatic way of saying remainder, and mod means something

89
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,140
like where the thing you divide by is.

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,660
So, for example, 6 goes into 20 three times, and it leaves a remainder of 2.

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,400
So 20 has a residue of 2 mod 6.

92
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,700
Together with all the other numbers leaving a remainder of 2 when the thing you divide

93
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,580
by is 6, you have a full residue class mod 6.

94
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,540
I know that sounds like the world's most pretentious way of saying everything 2 above

95
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,160
a multiple of 6, but this is the standard jargon, and it is actually handy to have some

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,100
words for the idea.

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,080
So looking at our diagram, in the lingo, each of these spiral arms corresponds to a residue

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,660
class mod 6, and the reason we see them is that 6 is close to 2 pi, turning 6 radians

99
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,820
is almost a full turn.

100
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,620
And the reason we see only 2 of them when filtering for primes is that all prime numbers

101
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,140
are either 1 or 5 above a multiple of 6, with the exceptions of 2 and 3.

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,360
With all that as a warmup, let's think about the larger scale.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,260
In the same way that 6 steps is close to a full turn, taking 44 steps is very close to

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,320
a whole number of turns.

105
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,220
Here, let's compute it.

106
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,320
There are 2 pi radians per rotation, right?

107
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,760
So taking 44 steps, turning 44 radians, gives a total of 44 divided by 2 pi rotations, which

108
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,860
comes out to be just barely above 7 full turns.

109
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,320
You could also write this by saying that 44 sevenths is a close approximation for 2 pi,

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,040
which some of you may better recognize as the famous 22 sevenths approximation for pi.

111
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,920
What this means is when you count up by multiples of 44 in the diagram, each point has almost

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,800
the same angle as the last one, just a little bit bigger.

113
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,080
So as you continue on with more and more, we get this very gentle spiral as the angle

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
increases very slowly.

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,640
Similarly, all the numbers 1 above a multiple of 44 make another spiral, but rotated one

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,020
radian counterclockwise.

117
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,560
Same for everything 2 above a multiple of 44, and so on, eventually filling out the

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,220
full diagram.

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,920
To phrase it with our fancier language, each of these spiral arms shows a residue class

120
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
mod 44.

121
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,800
And maybe now you can tell me what happens when we limit our view to prime numbers.

122
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,500
Primes cannot be a multiple of 44, so that arm won't be visible.

123
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,220
Nor can a prime be 2 above a multiple of 44, or 4 above, and so on, since all those residue

124
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,100
classes have nothing but even numbers.

125
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,920
Likewise, any multiples of 11 can't be prime, except for 11 itself, so the spiral of numbers

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,300
11 above a multiple of 44 won't be visible, and neither will the spiral of numbers 33

127
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,540
above a multiple of 44.

128
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,920
This is what gives the picture those Milky Way-seeming gaps.

129
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,920
Each spiral we're left with is a residue class that doesn't share any prime factors

130
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,840
with 44.

131
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,520
And within each one of those arms that we can't reject out of hand, the prime numbers

132
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,460
seem to be randomly distributed.

133
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,100
That's a fact I'd like you to tuck away, we'll return to it later.

134
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,060
This is another good chance to inject some of the jargon mathematicians use.

135
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,680
What we care about right here are all the numbers between 0 and 43 that don't share

136
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,420
a prime factor with 44, right?

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,700
The ones that aren't even and aren't divisible by 11.

138
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,980
When two numbers don't share any factors like this, we call them relatively prime,

139
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,740
or also co-prime.

140
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,520
In this example you could count that there are 20 different numbers between 1 and 44

141
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,920
that are co-prime to 44, and this is a fact that a number theorist would compactly write

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,420
by saying phi of 44 equals 20, where the Greek letter phi here refers to Euler's

143
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,560
totient function, yet another needlessly fancy word, which is defined to be the number of

144
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,120
integers from 1 up to n which are co-prime to n.

145
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,380
It comes up enough that it's handy to have compact notation.

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,720
More obscurely, and I had never heard this before but I find it too delightful not to

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,240
tell, these numbers are sometimes called the totitives of n.

148
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Back to the main thread, in short, what the user on math exchange was seeing are two unrelated

149
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
pieces of number theory but illustrated in one drawing.

150
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,460
The first is that 44 sevenths is a very close rational approximation for 2 pi, which results

151
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,540
in the residue classes mod 44 being cleanly separated out.

152
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,180
The second is that many of these residue classes contain zero prime numbers, or sometimes just

153
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,220
one, so they won't show up, but on the other hand primes do show up enough in

154
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,240
all 20 of the other residue classes that it makes these spiral arms visible.

155
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,040
And at this point maybe you can predict what's going on at the larger scale.

156
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,340
Just as 6 radians is vaguely close to a full turn, and 44 radians is quite close to 7 full

157
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,660
turns, it just so happens that 710 radians is extremely close to a whole number of full

158
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,060
turns.

159
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,840
Visually, you can see this by the fact that the point ends up almost exactly on the x-axis,

160
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,860
but it's more compelling analytically.

161
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:30,280
710 radians is 710 divided by 2 pi rotations, which works out to be 113.000095.

162
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,180
Some of you may have seen this in another form.

163
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,920
It's saying that 710 one hundred thirteenths is a close approximation for 2 pi, which is

164
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,800
more commonly seen in saying that 355 over 113 is a very good approximation for pi.

165
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,620
If you want to understand where these rational approximations are coming from, and what it

166
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,380
means for one like this to be unusually good, like way better than you would get for phi

167
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,580
or e or square root of 2 or other famous irrationals, I highly recommend taking a look at this great

168
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,500
Mathologer video.

169
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,680
For our storyline though, it means that when you move forward by steps of 710, the angle

170
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,260
of each new point is almost exactly the same as the last one, just microscopically bigger.

171
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,320
Even very far out, one of these sequences looks like a straight line.

172
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,380
And of course, the other residue classes, mod 710, also form these nearly straight lines.

173
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,260
710 is a big number though, so when all of them are on screen, and there's only so

174
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,040
many pixels on the screen, it's a little hard to make them out.

175
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,980
So in this case, it's actually easier to see when we limit the view to primes, where

176
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,000
you don't see many of those residue classes.

177
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,580
In reality, with a little further zooming, you can see that there actually is a very

178
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,860
gentle spiral to these.

179
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,460
But the fact that it takes so long to become prominent is a wonderful illustration, maybe

180
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,580
the best illustration I've ever seen, for just how good an approximation this is for

181
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,000
2 pi.

182
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,740
Tying up the remaining loose thread here, if you want to understand what happens when

183
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,080
you filter for primes, it's entirely analogous to what we did before.

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,460
The factors of 710 are 71, 5, and 2, so if the remainder, or residue, is divisible by

185
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,440
any of those, then so is the number.

186
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,000
When you pull up all of the residue classes with odd numbers, it looks like every other

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
ray in the otherwise quite crowded picture.

188
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,060
And then of those that remain, these are the ones that are divisible by 5, which are nice

189
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,360
and evenly spaced at every 5th line.

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,500
Notice the fact that prime numbers never show up in any of these is what explains the pattern

191
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,320
of the lines we saw at the beginning coming in clumps of 4.

192
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,340
And moreover, of those remaining, these four residue classes are the ones that are divisible

193
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,200
by 71, so the primes aren't going to show up there, and that's what explains why the

194
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,080
clumps of 4 that we saw occasionally have a missing tooth in your cone.

195
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,320
And if you were wondering where that number 280 came from, it comes from counting how

196
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,520
many of the numbers from 1 up to 710 don't share any prime factors with 710.

197
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,600
These are the ones that we can't rule out for including primes based on some obvious

198
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,940
divisibility consideration.

199
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,540
This of course doesn't guarantee that any particular one will contain prime numbers,

200
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,880
but at least empirically when you look at this picture, it actually seems like the primes

201
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,560
are pretty evenly distributed among the remaining classes, wouldn't you agree?

202
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,760
This last point is actually the most interesting observation of the whole deal.

203
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,500
It relates to a pretty deep fact in number theory, known as Dirichlet's theorem.

204
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,120
To take a simpler example than residue classes mod 710, think of those mod 10.

205
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,860
Because we write numbers in base 10, this is the same thing as grouping numbers together

206
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,400
by what their last digit is.

207
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,860
Everything whose last digit is 0 is a residue class, everything whose last digit is 1 is

208
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,960
another residue class, and so on.

209
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,260
Other than 2, prime numbers can't have an even number as their last digit, since that

210
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,920
means they're even.

211
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,820
And likewise, any prime bigger than 5 can't end in a 5.

212
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,320
There's nothing surprising there, that's one of the first facts you observe when you

213
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
learn about prime numbers.

214
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,080
Anything bigger than 5 has to end in either a 1, a 3, a 7, or a 9.

215
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,240
A much more nuanced question, though, is how exactly these primes are divvied up among

216
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,500
those remaining four groups.

217
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,720
Here, let's make a quick histogram, counting through each prime number, where the bars

218
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,760
are going to show what proportion of the primes we've seen so far have a given last digit.

219
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,000
So in particular, the 2 and the 5 slots should go down to 0 over time.

220
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,620
What would you predict is going to happen as we move through more and more primes?

221
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,060
Well, as we get a lot of them, it seems like a pretty even spread between these four classes,

222
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,720
about 25% each.

223
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,020
And probably that's what you would expect.

224
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,420
After all, why would prime numbers show some sort of preference for one last digit over

225
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,880
another?

226
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,500
But primes aren't random, they are a definite sequence, and they show patterns in other

227
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,040
ways, and it's highly non-obvious how you would prove something like this.

228
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,740
Or, for that matter, how do you rigorously phrase what it is you want to prove?

229
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,020
A mathematician might go about it something like this.

230
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,140
If you look at all the prime numbers less than some big number x, and you consider what

231
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:35,080
fraction of them are, say, 1 above a multiple of 10, that fraction should approach 1 fourth

232
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:42,280
as x approaches infinity, and likewise for all of the other allowable residue classes,

233
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,860
like 3 and 7 and 9.

234
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Of course, there's nothing special about 10.

235
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,180
A similar fact should hold for any other number.

236
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,820
Considering our old friends the residue classes mod 44, for example, let's make a similar

237
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,040
histogram, showing what proportion of the primes show up in each one of these.

238
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,160
Again, as time goes on, we see an even spread between the 20 different allowable residue

239
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,620
classes, which you can think of in terms of each spiral arm from our diagram having

240
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,140
about the same number of primes as each of the others.

241
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,940
Maybe that's what you'd expect, but this is a shockingly hard fact to prove.

242
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,520
The first man who cracked this puzzle was Dirichlet in 1837, and it forms one of the

243
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,840
crowning jewels at the foundation of modern analytic number theory.

244
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Histograms like these ones give a pretty good illustration of what the theorem is actually

245
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,120
saying.

246
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,580
Nevertheless, you might find it enlightening to see how it might be written in a math text,

247
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,260
with all the fancy jargon and everything.

248
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,720
It's essentially what we just saw for 10, but more general.

249
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Again, you look at all the primes up to some bound x, but instead of asking for what proportion

250
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:03,320
of them have a residue of, say, 1 mod 10, you ask what proportion have a residue of

251
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,800
r mod n, where n is any number, and r is anything that's co-primed to n.

252
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,280
Remember, that means it doesn't share any factors with n bigger than 1.

253
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,940
Instead of approaching 1 fourth as x goes to infinity, that proportion goes to 1 divided

254
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,080
by phi of n, where phi is that special function I mentioned earlier that gives the number

255
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,380
of possible residues co-primed to n.

256
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,820
In case this is too clear for the reader, you might see it buried in more notation,

257
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,420
where this denominator and the numerator are both written with a special prime-counting

258
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,760
function.

259
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,980
The convention, rather confusingly, is to use the symbol pi for this function, even

260
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,380
though it's totally unrelated to the number pi.

261
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,500
In some contexts, when people refer to Dirichlet's theorem, they refer to a much more modest

262
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,920
statement, which is simply that each of these residue classes that might have infinitely

263
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,340
many primes does have infinitely many.

264
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,280
In order to prove this, what Dirichlet did was show that the primes are just as dense

265
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,060
in any one of these residue classes as in any other.

266
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,280
For example, imagine someone asks you to prove that there are infinitely many primes ending

267
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,600
in the number 1, and the way you do it is by showing that a quarter of all the primes

268
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,620
end in a 1.

269
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,760
Together with the fact that there are infinitely many primes, which we've known since Euclid,

270
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,100
this gives a stronger statement, and a much more interesting one.

271
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,900
Now the proof, well, it's way more involved than would be reasonable to show here.

272
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,260
One interesting fact worth mentioning is that it relies heavily on complex analysis, which

273
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,740
is the study of doing calculus with functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers.

274
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,100
Now that might seem weird, right?

275
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,300
Prime numbers seem wholly unrelated to the continuous world of calculus, much less when

276
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,200
complex numbers end up in the mix, but since the early 19th century, this is absolutely

277
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,460
par for the course when it comes to understanding how primes are distributed.

278
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,440
And this isn't just antiquated technology either.

279
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,960
Understanding the distribution of primes in residue classes like this continues to be

280
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
relevant in modern research too.

281
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,500
Some of the recent breakthroughs on small gaps between primes, edging towards that ever-elusive

282
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,640
twin-prime conjecture, have their basis in understanding how primes split up among these

283
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,900
kinds of residue classes.

284
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,460
Okay, looking back over the puzzle, I want to emphasize something.

285
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,480
The original bit of data visualization whimsy that led to these patterns, well, it doesn't

286
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
matter, no one cares.

287
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,840
There's nothing special about plotting p,p in polar coordinates, and most of the initial

288
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,020
mystery in these spirals resulted from the artifacts that come from dealing with integer

289
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,100
number of radians, which is kind of weird.

290
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,720
But on the other hand, this kind of play is clearly worth it if the end result is a line

291
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,000
of questions that leads you to something like Dirichlet's theorem, which is important,

292
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,340
especially if it inspires you to learn enough to understand the tactics of the underlying

293
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,680
proof.

294
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,900
No small task, by the way.

295
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,460
And this isn't a coincidence that a fairly random question like this can lead you to

296
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,200
an important and deep fact for math.

297
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,980
What it means for a piece of math to be important and deep is that it connects to many other

298
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,480
topics.

299
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,500
So even an arbitrary exploration of numbers, as long as it's not too arbitrary, has a

300
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,660
chance of stumbling into something meaningful.

301
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Sure, you'll get a much more concentrated dosage of important facts by going through

302
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,220
a textbook or a course, and there will be many fewer uninteresting dead ends, but there

303
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,160
is something special about rediscovering these topics on your own.

304
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,780
If you effectively reinvent Euler's totient function before you've ever seen it defined,

305
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,460
or if you start wondering about rational approximations before learning about continued fractions,

306
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,160
or if you seriously explore how primes are divvied up between residue classes before

307
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,860
you've even heard the name Dirichlet, then when you do learn those topics, you'll see

308
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,540
them as familiar friends, not as arbitrary definitions, and that will almost certainly

309
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,040
mean that you learn it more effectively.

310
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,040
Thank you.
