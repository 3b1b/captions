1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,172
I first saw this pattern that I'm about to show 

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,340
you in a question on the Math Stack Exchange.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,753
It was asked by a user under the name Dwymark, and answered by Greg Martin, 

4
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,385
and it relates to the distribution of prime numbers, 

5
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,620
together with rational approximations for pi.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,020
You see, what the user had been doing was playing around with data in polar coordinates.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,639
As a quick reminder so we're all on the same page, 

8
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:29,961
this means labeling points in 2D space not with the usual xy coordinates, 

9
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:34,342
but instead with a distance from the origin, commonly called r for radius, 

10
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:39,600
together with the angle that radial line makes with the horizontal, commonly called theta.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,204
For our purposes, this angle will be measured in radians, 

12
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:50,000
which basically means that an angle of pi is halfway around, and 2 pi is a full circle.

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,137
Notice, polar coordinates are not unique, in the sense that adding 2 pi to that second 

14
00:00:56,137 --> 00:01:00,380
coordinate doesn't change the location that this pair of numbers is referring to.

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,047
The pattern that we'll look at centers around plotting points 

16
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,720
where both of these coordinates are a given prime number.

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,544
There is no practical reason to do this, it's purely fun, 

18
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:14,000
we're just frolicking around in the playground of data visualization.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
To get a sense for what it means, look at all the whole numbers, 

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
rather than just the primes.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,772
The point 1,1 sets a distance 1 away from the origin, with an angle of 1 radian, 

22
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:27,940
which actually means this arc is the same length as that radial line.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,520
And then 2,2 has twice that angle, and twice the distance.

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,578
And to get to 3,3, you rotate one more radian, 

25
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,742
with a total angle that's now slightly less than a half turn, 

26
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:43,080
since 3 is slightly less than pi, and you step one unit farther away from the origin.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,797
I really want you to make sure that it's clear what's being plotted, 

28
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:49,300
because everything that follows depends on understanding it.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,281
Each step forward is like the tip of a clock hand, 

30
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:56,261
which rotates one radian with each tick a little less than a sixth of a turn, 

31
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,200
and it grows by one unit at each step.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,578
As you continue, these points spiral outwards, 

33
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:05,060
forming what's known in the business as an archimedean spiral.

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,560
Now if you make the admittedly arbitrary move to knock out everything 

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,040
except the prime numbers, it initially looks quite random, after all, 

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,520
primes are famous for their chaotic and difficult to predict behavior.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,031
But when you zoom out, what you start to see are these very clear 

38
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:28,880
galactic-seeming spirals, and what's weird is some of the arms seem to be missing.

39
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:40,024
And zooming out even further, those spirals give way to a different pattern, 

40
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:45,500
these many different outward-pointing rays.

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,310
And those rays seem to mostly come in clumps of four, 

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,640
but there's the occasional gap, like a comb missing its teeth.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,380
The question for you and me, naturally, is what on earth is going on here?

44
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,970
Where do these spirals come from, and why do we 

45
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,160
instead get straight lines at this larger scale?

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,434
If you wanted, you could ask a more quantitative question, 

47
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:15,151
and count that there are 20 total spirals, and then up at that larger scale, 

48
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:19,440
if you patiently went through each ray, you'd count up a total of 280.

49
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,969
And so this adds a further mystery of where these numbers are coming from, 

50
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,760
and why they would arise from primes.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,398
Now this is shocking, and beautiful, and you might think that 

52
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:33,260
it suggests some divine hidden symmetry within the primes.

53
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,110
But to steady your expectations, I should say that the fact that the person asking 

54
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,400
this question jumped right into prime numbers makes the puzzle a little misleading.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,521
If you look at all the whole numbers, not just the primes, 

56
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,640
as you zoom out, you see very similar spirals.

57
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,885
They're much cleaner, and now there's 44 of them instead of 20, 

58
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:01,294
but it means that the question of where the spirals come from is, 

59
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:05,375
perhaps disappointingly, completely separate from the question of what happens 

60
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,080
when we limit our view to primes.

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,420
But don't be too disappointed, because both these questions are still phenomenal puzzles.

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,302
There's a very satisfying answer for the spirals, 

63
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,665
and even if the primes don't cause the spirals, 

64
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:21,112
asking what goes on when you filter for those primes does lead you to 

65
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:24,854
one of the most important theorems about the distribution of prime numbers, 

66
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:27,120
known in number theory as Dirichlet's theorem.

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,460
To kick things off, let's zoom back in a little bit smaller.

68
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,640
Did you notice that as we were zooming out, there were these six little spirals?

69
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,780
This offers a good starting point to explain what's happening in the two larger patterns.

70
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,020
Notice how all the multiples of 6 form one arm of this spiral.

71
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,040
Then the next one is every integer that's one above a multiple of 6.

72
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,080
Then after that it includes all the numbers 2 above a multiple of 6, and so on.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,260
Why is that?

74
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,128
Well, remember that each step forward in this sequence involves a turn of one radian, 

75
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:07,753
so when you count up by 6, you've turned a total of 6 radians, 

76
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:10,400
which is a little less than 2 pi, a full turn.

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,660
So every time you count up by 6, you've almost made a full turn, it's just a little less.

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,820
Another six steps, a slightly smaller angle.

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,160
Six more steps, smaller still, and so on, with this angle changing 

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,140
gently enough that it gives the illusion of a single curving line.

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,300
When you limit the view to prime numbers, all but two of these spiral arms will go away.

82
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,520
And think about it, a prime number can't be a multiple of 6, 

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,043
and it also can't be 2 above a multiple of 6 unless it's 2, 

84
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:45,800
or 4 above a multiple of 6, since all of those are even numbers.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,568
It also can't be 3 above a multiple of 6, unless it's the number 3 itself, 

86
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,680
since all of those are divisible by 3.

87
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,440
So, at least at this smaller scale, nothing magical is going on.

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,951
And while we're in this simpler context, let me 

89
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:02,280
introduce some terminology that mathematicians use.

90
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,251
Each one of these sequences, where you're counting up by 6, 

91
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,740
is fancifully called a residue class mod 6.

92
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,383
The word residue here is sort of an overdramatic way of saying remainder, 

93
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:18,140
and mod means something like where the thing you divide by is.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,660
So, for example, 6 goes into 20 three times, and it leaves a remainder of 2.

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,400
So 20 has a residue of 2 mod 6.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,810
Together with all the other numbers leaving a remainder of 2 when 

97
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,580
the thing you divide by is 6, you have a full residue class mod 6.

98
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,675
I know that sounds like the world's most pretentious way of saying 

99
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:45,193
everything 2 above a multiple of 6, but this is the standard jargon, 

100
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:48,100
and it is actually handy to have some words for the idea.

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,986
So looking at our diagram, in the lingo, each of these spiral arms 

102
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:56,814
corresponds to a residue class mod 6, and the reason we see them 

103
00:06:56,814 --> 00:07:00,820
is that 6 is close to 2 pi, turning 6 radians is almost a full turn.

104
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,826
And the reason we see only 2 of them when filtering for primes is that all prime 

105
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:10,140
numbers are either 1 or 5 above a multiple of 6, with the exceptions of 2 and 3.

106
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,360
With all that as a warmup, let's think about the larger scale.

107
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,232
In the same way that 6 steps is close to a full turn, 

108
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:21,320
taking 44 steps is very close to a whole number of turns.

109
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,220
Here, let's compute it.

110
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,320
There are 2 pi radians per rotation, right?

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,089
So taking 44 steps, turning 44 radians, gives a total of 44 divided by 2 pi rotations, 

112
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,860
which comes out to be just barely above 7 full turns.

113
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,384
You could also write this by saying that 44 sevenths is a close approximation for 2 pi, 

114
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:47,040
which some of you may better recognize as the famous 22 sevenths approximation for pi.

115
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,363
What this means is when you count up by multiples of 44 in the diagram, 

116
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:56,800
each point has almost the same angle as the last one, just a little bit bigger.

117
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,390
So as you continue on with more and more, we get this 

118
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,520
very gentle spiral as the angle increases very slowly.

119
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,676
Similarly, all the numbers 1 above a multiple of 44 make another spiral, 

120
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:12,020
but rotated one radian counterclockwise.

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,951
Same for everything 2 above a multiple of 44, and so on, 

122
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,220
eventually filling out the full diagram.

123
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,048
To phrase it with our fancier language, each of 

124
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,720
these spiral arms shows a residue class mod 44.

125
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,799
And maybe now you can tell me what happens when we limit our view to prime numbers.

126
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,500
Primes cannot be a multiple of 44, so that arm won't be visible.

127
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,742
Nor can a prime be 2 above a multiple of 44, or 4 above, and so on, 

128
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:45,100
since all those residue classes have nothing but even numbers.

129
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,287
Likewise, any multiples of 11 can't be prime, except for 11 itself, 

130
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:56,537
so the spiral of numbers 11 above a multiple of 44 won't be visible, 

131
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,540
and neither will the spiral of numbers 33 above a multiple of 44.

132
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,920
This is what gives the picture those Milky Way-seeming gaps.

133
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,179
Each spiral we're left with is a residue class 

134
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,840
that doesn't share any prime factors with 44.

135
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,036
And within each one of those arms that we can't reject out of hand, 

136
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,460
the prime numbers seem to be randomly distributed.

137
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,100
That's a fact I'd like you to tuck away, we'll return to it later.

138
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,060
This is another good chance to inject some of the jargon mathematicians use.

139
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,561
What we care about right here are all the numbers between 

140
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,420
0 and 43 that don't share a prime factor with 44, right?

141
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,700
The ones that aren't even and aren't divisible by 11.

142
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,447
When two numbers don't share any factors like this, 

143
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:42,740
we call them relatively prime, or also co-prime.

144
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,322
In this example you could count that there are 20 different numbers between 1 

145
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:53,350
and 44 that are co-prime to 44, and this is a fact that a number theorist would 

146
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,304
compactly write by saying phi of 44 equals 20, 

147
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:00,578
where the Greek letter phi here refers to Euler's totient function, 

148
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:05,668
yet another needlessly fancy word, which is defined to be the number of integers 

149
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:08,120
from 1 up to n which are co-prime to n.

150
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,380
It comes up enough that it's handy to have compact notation.

151
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,414
More obscurely, and I had never heard this before but I find it too 

152
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:19,240
delightful not to tell, these numbers are sometimes called the totitives of n.

153
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,736
Back to the main thread, in short, what the user on math exchange was seeing 

154
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:28,000
are two unrelated pieces of number theory but illustrated in one drawing.

155
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,809
The first is that 44 sevenths is a very close rational approximation for 2 pi, 

156
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:38,540
which results in the residue classes mod 44 being cleanly separated out.

157
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,969
The second is that many of these residue classes contain zero prime numbers, 

158
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:48,443
or sometimes just one, so they won't show up, but on the other hand primes do show 

159
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:53,240
up enough in all 20 of the other residue classes that it makes these spiral arms visible.

160
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,040
And at this point maybe you can predict what's going on at the larger scale.

161
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,933
Just as 6 radians is vaguely close to a full turn, 

162
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,134
and 44 radians is quite close to 7 full turns, 

163
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:12,060
it just so happens that 710 radians is extremely close to a whole number of full turns.

164
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,658
Visually, you can see this by the fact that the point ends up 

165
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,860
almost exactly on the x-axis, but it's more compelling analytically.

166
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:30,280
710 radians is 710 divided by 2 pi rotations, which works out to be 113.000095.

167
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,180
Some of you may have seen this in another form.

168
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,809
It's saying that 710 one hundred thirteenths is a close approximation for 2 pi, 

169
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:44,344
which is more commonly seen in saying that 355 over 113 is a very good approximation 

170
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:44,800
for pi.

171
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,373
If you want to understand where these rational approximations are coming from, 

172
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:53,320
and what it means for one like this to be unusually good, 

173
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,927
like way better than you would get for phi or e or square root of 2 or 

174
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:01,500
other famous irrationals, I highly recommend taking a look at this great Mathologer video.

175
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,260
For our storyline though, it means that when you move forward by steps of 710, 

176
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,579
the angle of each new point is almost exactly the same as the last one, 

177
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,260
just microscopically bigger.

178
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,320
Even very far out, one of these sequences looks like a straight line.

179
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,380
And of course, the other residue classes, mod 710, also form these nearly straight lines.

180
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,287
710 is a big number though, so when all of them are on screen, 

181
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:33,040
and there's only so many pixels on the screen, it's a little hard to make them out.

182
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,596
So in this case, it's actually easier to see when we limit the view to primes, 

183
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:41,000
where you don't see many of those residue classes.

184
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,866
In reality, with a little further zooming, you can see 

185
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:47,860
that there actually is a very gentle spiral to these.

186
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,370
But the fact that it takes so long to become prominent is a wonderful illustration, 

187
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,566
maybe the best illustration I've ever seen, for just how good an approximation this is 

188
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:57,000
for 2 pi.

189
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,419
Tying up the remaining loose thread here, if you want to understand what 

190
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:06,080
happens when you filter for primes, it's entirely analogous to what we did before.

191
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,257
The factors of 710 are 71, 5, and 2, so if the remainder, 

192
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:16,440
or residue, is divisible by any of those, then so is the number.

193
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,549
When you pull up all of the residue classes with odd numbers, 

194
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:26,300
it looks like every other ray in the otherwise quite crowded picture.

195
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,348
And then of those that remain, these are the ones that are divisible by 5, 

196
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:37,360
which are nice and evenly spaced at every 5th line.

197
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,429
Notice the fact that prime numbers never show up in any of these is what 

198
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:47,320
explains the pattern of the lines we saw at the beginning coming in clumps of 4.

199
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,760
And moreover, of those remaining, these four residue classes are the ones that are 

200
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,240
divisible by 71, so the primes aren't going to show up there, 

201
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,013
and that's what explains why the clumps of 4 that we saw occasionally have a missing 

202
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,080
tooth in your cone.

203
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,098
And if you were wondering where that number 280 came from, 

204
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:13,086
it comes from counting how many of the numbers from 1 up to 710 don't share any 

205
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,520
prime factors with 710.

206
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,580
These are the ones that we can't rule out for including 

207
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,940
primes based on some obvious divisibility consideration.

208
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,312
This of course doesn't guarantee that any particular one will contain prime numbers, 

209
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:28,061
but at least empirically when you look at this picture, 

210
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:32,185
it actually seems like the primes are pretty evenly distributed among the remaining 

211
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,560
classes, wouldn't you agree?

212
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,760
This last point is actually the most interesting observation of the whole deal.

213
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,500
It relates to a pretty deep fact in number theory, known as Dirichlet's theorem.

214
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,120
To take a simpler example than residue classes mod 710, think of those mod 10.

215
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,740
Because we write numbers in base 10, this is the same thing 

216
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,400
as grouping numbers together by what their last digit is.

217
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,249
Everything whose last digit is 0 is a residue class, 

218
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:03,960
everything whose last digit is 1 is another residue class, and so on.

219
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,657
Other than 2, prime numbers can't have an even number as their last digit, 

220
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,920
since that means they're even.

221
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,820
And likewise, any prime bigger than 5 can't end in a 5.

222
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,183
There's nothing surprising there, that's one of the 

223
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:17,320
first facts you observe when you learn about prime numbers.

224
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,080
Anything bigger than 5 has to end in either a 1, a 3, a 7, or a 9.

225
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,622
A much more nuanced question, though, is how exactly these 

226
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:28,500
primes are divvied up among those remaining four groups.

227
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,219
Here, let's make a quick histogram, counting through each prime number, 

228
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:37,862
where the bars are going to show what proportion of the primes we've seen so far have a 

229
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:38,760
given last digit.

230
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,000
So in particular, the 2 and the 5 slots should go down to 0 over time.

231
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,620
What would you predict is going to happen as we move through more and more primes?

232
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,218
Well, as we get a lot of them, it seems like a pretty 

233
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:59,720
even spread between these four classes, about 25% each.

234
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,020
And probably that's what you would expect.

235
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,695
After all, why would prime numbers show some sort 

236
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,880
of preference for one last digit over another?

237
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,093
But primes aren't random, they are a definite sequence, 

238
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:13,826
and they show patterns in other ways, and it's highly non-obvious how you would 

239
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,040
prove something like this.

240
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,740
Or, for that matter, how do you rigorously phrase what it is you want to prove?

241
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,020
A mathematician might go about it something like this.

242
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,260
If you look at all the prime numbers less than some big number x, 

243
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,578
and you consider what fraction of them are, say, 1 above a multiple of 10, 

244
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:38,187
that fraction should approach 1 fourth as x approaches infinity, 

245
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:43,860
and likewise for all of the other allowable residue classes, like 3 and 7 and 9.

246
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Of course, there's nothing special about 10.

247
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,180
A similar fact should hold for any other number.

248
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,559
Considering our old friends the residue classes mod 44, for example, 

249
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,320
let's make a similar histogram, showing what proportion of the primes show up in each 

250
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,040
one of these.

251
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,329
Again, as time goes on, we see an even spread between the 20 different 

252
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,508
allowable residue classes, which you can think of in terms of each spiral 

253
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:21,140
arm from our diagram having about the same number of primes as each of the others.

254
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,940
Maybe that's what you'd expect, but this is a shockingly hard fact to prove.

255
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,344
The first man who cracked this puzzle was Dirichlet in 1837, 

256
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:35,994
and it forms one of the crowning jewels at the foundation of modern analytic 

257
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:36,840
number theory.

258
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,912
Histograms like these ones give a pretty good 

259
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:42,120
illustration of what the theorem is actually saying.

260
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Nevertheless, you might find it enlightening to see how it might 

261
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,260
be written in a math text, with all the fancy jargon and everything.

262
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,720
It's essentially what we just saw for 10, but more general.

263
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,018
Again, you look at all the primes up to some bound x, 

264
00:17:56,018 --> 00:18:01,865
but instead of asking for what proportion of them have a residue of, say, 1 mod 10, 

265
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:07,015
you ask what proportion have a residue of r mod n, where n is any number, 

266
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:09,800
and r is anything that's co-primed to n.

267
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,280
Remember, that means it doesn't share any factors with n bigger than 1.

268
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,300
Instead of approaching 1 fourth as x goes to infinity, 

269
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,967
that proportion goes to 1 divided by phi of n, 

270
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,940
where phi is that special function I mentioned earlier that gives the 

271
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,380
number of possible residues co-primed to n.

272
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,365
In case this is too clear for the reader, you might see it buried in more notation, 

273
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,993
where this denominator and the numerator are both written 

274
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:35,760
with a special prime-counting function.

275
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,585
The convention, rather confusingly, is to use the symbol pi for this function, 

276
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:43,380
even though it's totally unrelated to the number pi.

277
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,252
In some contexts, when people refer to Dirichlet's theorem, 

278
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,942
they refer to a much more modest statement, which is simply that each of 

279
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:55,340
these residue classes that might have infinitely many primes does have infinitely many.

280
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,570
In order to prove this, what Dirichlet did was show that the primes 

281
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,060
are just as dense in any one of these residue classes as in any other.

282
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,303
For example, imagine someone asks you to prove that there are 

283
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,641
infinitely many primes ending in the number 1, 

284
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:13,620
and the way you do it is by showing that a quarter of all the primes end in a 1.

285
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,792
Together with the fact that there are infinitely many primes, 

286
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,679
which we've known since Euclid, this gives a stronger statement, 

287
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,100
and a much more interesting one.

288
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,900
Now the proof, well, it's way more involved than would be reasonable to show here.

289
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,495
One interesting fact worth mentioning is that it relies heavily on complex analysis, 

290
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:35,631
which is the study of doing calculus with functions whose 

291
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,740
inputs and outputs are complex numbers.

292
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,100
Now that might seem weird, right?

293
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,253
Prime numbers seem wholly unrelated to the continuous world of calculus, 

294
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:48,549
much less when complex numbers end up in the mix, but since the early 19th century, 

295
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,846
this is absolutely par for the course when it comes to understanding how primes are 

296
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:53,460
distributed.

297
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,440
And this isn't just antiquated technology either.

298
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,800
Understanding the distribution of primes in residue classes 

299
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,720
like this continues to be relevant in modern research too.

300
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,298
Some of the recent breakthroughs on small gaps between primes, 

301
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:09,194
edging towards that ever-elusive twin-prime conjecture, 

302
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:12,917
have their basis in understanding how primes split up among these kinds 

303
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:13,900
of residue classes.

304
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,460
Okay, looking back over the puzzle, I want to emphasize something.

305
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,412
The original bit of data visualization whimsy that led to these patterns, 

306
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,720
well, it doesn't matter, no one cares.

307
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,364
There's nothing special about plotting p,p in polar coordinates, 

308
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,207
and most of the initial mystery in these spirals resulted from the artifacts 

309
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:40,100
that come from dealing with integer number of radians, which is kind of weird.

310
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,315
But on the other hand, this kind of play is clearly worth it if the 

311
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:48,786
end result is a line of questions that leads you to something like Dirichlet's theorem, 

312
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:52,291
which is important, especially if it inspires you to learn enough to 

313
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,680
understand the tactics of the underlying proof.

314
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,900
No small task, by the way.

315
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,258
And this isn't a coincidence that a fairly random question 

316
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,200
like this can lead you to an important and deep fact for math.

317
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,610
What it means for a piece of math to be important 

318
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,480
and deep is that it connects to many other topics.

319
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,681
So even an arbitrary exploration of numbers, as long as it's not too arbitrary, 

320
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,660
has a chance of stumbling into something meaningful.

321
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,121
Sure, you'll get a much more concentrated dosage of important facts by going 

322
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:28,388
through a textbook or a course, and there will be many fewer uninteresting dead ends, 

323
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,160
but there is something special about rediscovering these topics on your own.

324
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,042
If you effectively reinvent Euler's totient function before you've ever seen it defined, 

325
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,971
or if you start wondering about rational approximations before learning about 

326
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:45,152
continued fractions, or if you seriously explore how primes are divvied up between 

327
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:48,225
residue classes before you've even heard the name Dirichlet, 

328
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,952
then when you do learn those topics, you'll see them as familiar friends, 

329
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:56,032
not as arbitrary definitions, and that will almost certainly mean that you learn 

330
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,040
it more effectively.

331
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,880
Thank you.
