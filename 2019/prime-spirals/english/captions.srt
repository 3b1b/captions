1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
I first saw this pattern that I'm about to show you in a question on the Math Stack Exchange.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,640
It was asked by a user under the name Dwymark, and answered by Greg Martin, and it relates

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,880
to the distribution of prime numbers, together with rational approximations for pi.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,740
You see, what the user had been doing was playing around with data in polar coordinates.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,280
As a quick reminder so we're all on the same page, this means labeling points in 2D space

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,920
not with the usual xy coordinates, but instead with a distance from the origin, commonly

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,640
called r for radius, together with the angle that radial line makes with the horizontal,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,400
commonly called theta.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,920
And for our purposes, this angle will be measured in radians, which basically means that an

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,720
angle of pi is halfway around, and 2 pi is a full circle.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,220
And notice, polar coordinates are not unique, in the sense that adding 2 pi to that second

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,140
coordinate doesn't change the location that this pair of numbers is referring to.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,260
The pattern that we'll look at centers around plotting points where both of these coordinates

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,820
are a given prime number.

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,220
There is no practical reason to do this, it's purely fun, we're just frolicking around

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,220
in the playground of data visualization, and to get a sense for what it means, look at

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,040
all the whole numbers, rather than just the primes.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,260
The point 1,1 sits a distance 1 away from the origin, with an angle of 1 radian, which

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,540
means this arc is the same length as that radial line, and 2,2 has twice that angle,

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,380
and twice the distance.

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,980
And to get to 3,3, you rotate one more radian, with a total angle that's now slightly less

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,420
than a half turn, since 3 is slightly less than pi, and you step one unit farther away

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,420
from the origin.

24
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,380
I really want you to make sure that it's clear what's being plotted, because everything

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,780
that follows depends on understanding it.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,380
Each step forward is like the tip of a clock hand, which rotates one radian with each tick,

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,100
a little less than a sixth of a turn, and it grows by one unit at each step.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,800
As you continue, these points spiral outwards, forming what's known in the business as

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,300
an archimedean spiral.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,380
Now if you make the admittedly arbitrary move to knock out everything except the prime numbers,

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,660
it initially looks quite random, after all, primes are famous for their chaotic and difficult

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,280
to predict behavior.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:25,400
When you zoom out, what you start to see are these very clear galactic-seeming spirals,

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,800
and what's weird is some of the arms seem to be missing.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:43,760
Then zooming out even further, those spirals give way to a different pattern, these many

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,900
different outward-pointing rays.

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,180
And those rays seem to mostly come in clumps of four, but there's the occasional gap,

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,580
like a comb missing its teeth.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,980
The question for you and me, naturally, is what on earth is going on here?

40
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,920
Where do these spirals come from, and why do we instead get straight lines at this larger

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
scale?

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,800
If you wanted, you could ask a more quantitative question, and count that there are 20 total

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,040
spirals, and then up at that larger scale, if you patiently went through each ray, you'd

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,560
count up a total of 280.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
So this adds a further mystery of where these numbers are coming from, and why they would

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,640
arise from primes.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,940
This is shocking, and beautiful, and you might think that it suggests some divine hidden

48
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,840
symmetry within the primes, but to study your expectations, I should say that the fact that

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,160
the person asking this question on math exchange jumped right into prime numbers makes the

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,320
puzzle a little misleading.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:51,320
If you look at all the whole numbers, not just the primes, as you zoom out, you see

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,720
very similar spirals.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,600
They're much cleaner, and now there's 44 of them instead of 20, but it means that

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,560
the question of where the spirals come from is, perhaps disappointingly, completely separate

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
from the question of what happens when we limit our view to primes.

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,320
But don't be too disappointed, because both these questions are still phenomenal

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
puzzles.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,780
There's a very satisfying answer for the spirals, and even if the primes don't cause

59
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,720
the spirals, asking what goes on when you filter for those primes does lead you to one

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
of the most important theorems about the distribution of prime numbers, known in number theory as

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,080
Dirichlet's theorem.

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,200
To kick things off, let's zoom back in a little bit smaller.

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,300
Did you notice that as we were zooming out, there were these six little spirals?

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,580
This offers a good starting point to explain what's happening in the two larger patterns.

65
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,520
Notice how all the multiples of 6 form one arm of this spiral, then the next one is every

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,300
integer that's one above a multiple of 6, and then includes all the numbers 2 above

67
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,740
a multiple of 6, and so on.

68
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,540
Why is that?

69
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, remember that each step forward in this sequence involves a turn of one radian, so

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,620
when you count up by 6, you've turned a total of 6 radians, which is a little less

71
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,120
than 2 pi, a full turn.

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,400
So every time you count up by 6, you've almost made a full turn, it's just a little

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,840
less.

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,480
Another 6 steps, a slightly smaller angle.

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,640
6 more steps, smaller still, and so on, with this angle changing gently enough that it

76
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,560
gives the illusion of a single curving line.

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,160
When you limit the view to prime numbers, all but two of these spiral arms will go away.

78
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,920
And think about it, a prime number can't be a multiple of 6, and it also can't be

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,960
2 above a multiple of 6 unless it's 2, or 4 above a multiple of 6, since all of those

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,540
are even numbers.

81
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,080
It also can't be 3 above a multiple of 6, unless it's the number 3 itself, since all

82
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,240
of those are divisible by 3.

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,940
So at least at this smaller scale, nothing magical is going on.

84
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,140
And while we're in this simpler context, let me introduce some terminology that mathematicians

85
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
use.

86
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,540
Each one of these sequences, where you're counting up by 6, is fancifully called a residue

87
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,020
class mod 6.

88
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,660
The word residue here is sort of an overdramatic way of saying remainder, and mod means something

89
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,180
like where the thing you divide by is.

90
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,620
So for example, 6 goes into 20 three times, and it leaves a remainder of 2.

91
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,060
So 20 has a residue of 2 mod 6.

92
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,700
Together with all the other numbers leaving a remainder of 2 when the thing you divide

93
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,900
by is 6, you have a full residue class mod 6.

94
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,560
I know that sounds like the world's most pretentious way of saying everything 2 above

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,080
a multiple of 6, but this is the standard jargon, and it is actually handy to have some

96
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,920
words for the idea.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,060
So looking at our diagram, in the lingo, each of these spiral arms corresponds to a residue

98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,660
class mod 6, and the reason we see them is that 6 is close to 2 pi, turning 6 radians

99
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,620
is almost a full turn.

100
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,740
And the reason we see only 2 of them when filtering for primes is that all prime numbers

101
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,220
are either 1 or 5 above a multiple of 6, with the exception of 2 and 3.

102
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,980
With all that as a warmup, let's think about the larger scale.

103
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,200
In the same way that 6 steps is close to a full turn, taking 44 steps is very close to

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,660
a whole number of turns.

105
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,820
Here, let's compute it.

106
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:31,940
There are 2 pi radians per rotation, so taking 44 steps gives a total of 44 divided by 2

107
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,700
pi rotations, which comes out to be just barely above 7 full turns.

108
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,920
You could also write this by saying that 44 sevenths is a close approximation for 2 pi,

109
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,420
which some of you may better recognize as the famous 22 sevenths approximation for pi.

110
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,020
What this means is when you count up by multiples of 44 in the diagram, each point has almost

111
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,440
the same angle as the last one, just a little bit bigger.

112
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,060
So as you continue on with more and more, we get this very gentle spiral as the angle

113
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,660
increases very slowly.

114
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,600
Similarly, all the numbers 1 above a multiple of 44 make another spiral, but rotated one

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,920
radian counterclockwise.

116
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,500
Same for everything 2 above a multiple of 44, and so on, eventually filling out the

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,380
full diagram.

118
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,860
To phrase it with our fancier language, each of these spiral arms shows a residue class

119
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,340
mod 44.

120
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,140
And maybe now you can tell me what happens when we limit our view to prime numbers.

121
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,860
Primes cannot be a multiple of 44, so that arm won't be visible, nor can a prime be

122
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,900
2 above a multiple of 44, or 4 above, and so on, since all those residue classes have

123
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,740
nothing but even numbers.

124
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,980
Likewise, any multiples of 11 can't be prime, except for 11 itself, so the spiral of numbers

125
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,500
11 above a multiple of 44 won't be visible, and neither will the spiral of numbers 33

126
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,460
above a multiple of 44.

127
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,840
This is what gives the picture those Milky Way-seeming gaps.

128
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,180
Each spiral we're left with is a residue class that doesn't share any prime factors

129
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,780
with 44.

130
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,520
And within each one of those arms, that we can't reject out of hand, the prime numbers

131
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,100
seem to be randomly distributed, and that's a fact I'd like you to tuck away.

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,700
We'll return to it later.

133
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,260
This is another good chance to inject some of the jargon mathematicians use.

134
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,980
What we care about here are all the numbers between 0 and 43 that don't share a prime

135
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,820
factor with 44, right?

136
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,100
The ones that aren't even and aren't divisible by 11.

137
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,500
When two numbers don't share any factors like this, we call them relatively prime,

138
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
or co-prime.

139
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,940
In this example, you could count that there are 20 different numbers between 1 and 44

140
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,020
that are co-prime to 44, and this is a fact that a number theorist would compactly write

141
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,700
by saying phi of 44 equals 20, where the Greek letter phi here refers to Euler's totient

142
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,200
function, yet another needlessly fancy word, which is defined to be the number of integers

143
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,720
from 1 up to n, which are co-prime to n.

144
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
It comes up enough that it's handy to have compact notation.

145
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,640
More obscurely, and I had never heard this before but I find it too delightful not to

146
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,800
tell, these numbers are sometimes called the totitives of n.

147
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,260
Back to the main thread, in short, what the user on math exchange was seeing are two unrelated

148
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,600
pieces of number theory but illustrated in one drawing.

149
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,520
The first is that 44 sevenths is a very close rational approximation for 2 pi, which results

150
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,880
in the residue classes mod 44 being cleanly separated out.

151
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,440
The second is that many of these residue classes contain zero prime numbers, or sometimes just

152
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,040
1, so they won't show up, but on the other hand primes do show up enough in all 20 of

153
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,840
the other residue classes that it makes these spiral arms visible.

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,720
And at this point, maybe you can predict what's going on at the larger scale.

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,280
Just as 6 radians is vaguely close to a full turn, and 44 radians is quite close to 7 full

156
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,880
turns, it just so happens that 710 radians is extremely close to a whole number of full

157
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
turns.

158
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,320
Visually you can see this by the fact that the point ends up almost exactly on the x-axis,

159
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,120
but it's more compelling analytically.

160
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:31,560
710 radians is 710 divided by 2 pi rotations, which works out to be 113.000095.

161
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,020
Some of you may have seen this in another form, it's saying that 710 one hundred thirteenths

162
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,880
is a close approximation for 2 pi, which is more commonly seen in saying that 355 over

163
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,760
113 is a very good approximation for pi.

164
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,600
If you want to understand where these rational approximations are coming from, and what it

165
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,480
means for one like this to be unusually good, like way better than you would get for phi

166
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,520
or e or square root of 2 or other famous irrationals, I highly recommend taking a look at this great

167
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,580
Mathologer video.

168
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,680
For our storyline though, it means that when you move forward by steps of 710, the angle

169
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:16,040
of each new point is almost exactly the same as the last one, just microscopically bigger.

170
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,600
Even very far out, one of these sequences looks like a straight line, and of course

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,880
the other residue classes mod 710 also form these nearly straight lines.

172
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,200
710 is a big number though, so when all of them are on screen, and there's only so

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,880
many pixels on the screen, it's a little hard to make them out.

174
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,940
So in this case, it's actually easier to see when we limit the view to primes, where

175
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,200
you don't see many of those residue classes.

176
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,580
In reality, with a little further zooming, you can see that there actually is a very

177
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,460
gentle spiral to these.

178
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,480
But the fact that it takes so long to become prominent is a wonderful illustration, maybe

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,660
the best illustration I've ever seen, for just how good an approximation this is for

180
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,320
2 pi.

181
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,720
Tying up the remaining loose thread here, if you want to understand what happens when

182
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,760
you filter for primes, it's entirely analogous to what we did before.

183
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:14,380
The factors of 710 are 71, 5, and 2, so if the remainder, or residue, is divisible by

184
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,440
any of those, then so is the number.

185
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,940
When you pull up all of the residue classes with odd numbers, it looks like every other

186
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,080
ray in the otherwise quite crowded picture.

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,040
And then of those that remain, these are the ones that are divisible by 5, which are nice

188
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,160
and evenly spaced at every 5th line.

189
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,500
Notice the fact that prime numbers never show up in any of these is what explains the pattern

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,160
of the lines we saw at the beginning coming in clumps of 4.

191
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,320
And moreover, of those remaining, these four residue classes are the ones that are divisible

192
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,040
by 71, so the primes aren't going to show up there, and that's what explains why the

193
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,920
clumps of 4 that we saw occasionally have a missing tooth in your cone.

194
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,240
And if you were wondering where that number 280 came from, it comes from counting how

195
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,280
many of the numbers from 1 up to 710 don't share any prime factors with 710.

196
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,360
These are the ones we can't rule out for including primes based on some obvious divisibility

197
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
consideration.

198
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,160
This, of course, doesn't guarantee that any particular one will contain prime numbers,

199
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,880
but at least empirically when you look at this picture, it actually seems like the primes

200
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,040
are pretty evenly distributed among the remaining classes.

201
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,440
Wouldn't you agree?

202
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,120
This last point is actually the most interesting observation of the whole deal.

203
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,280
It relates to a pretty deep fact in number theory, known as Dirichlet's theorem.

204
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,160
To take a simpler example than residue classes mod 710, think of those mod 10.

205
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,860
Because we write numbers in base 10, this is the same thing as grouping numbers together

206
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,300
by what their last digit is.

207
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,880
Everything whose last digit is 0 is a residue class, everything whose last digit is 1 is

208
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,640
another residue class, and so on.

209
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,240
Other than 2, prime numbers can't have an even number as their last digit, since that

210
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,020
means they're even.

211
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,400
And likewise, any prime bigger than 5 can't end in a 5.

212
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,260
There's nothing surprising there, that's one of the first facts you observe when you

213
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,940
learn about prime numbers.

214
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,520
Anything bigger than 5 has to end in either a 1, a 3, a 7, or a 9.

215
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,220
A much more nuanced question, though, is how exactly these primes are divvied up among

216
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,880
those remaining four groups.

217
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,740
Here, let's make a quick histogram, counting through each prime number, where the bars

218
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,440
are going to show what proportion of the primes we've seen so far have a given last digit.

219
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
So in particular, the 2 and 5 slots should go down to 0 over time.

220
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,200
What would you predict is going to happen as we move through more and more primes?

221
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:58,340
Well, as we get a lot of them, it seems like a pretty even spread between these four classes,

222
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,300
about 25% each.

223
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,500
And probably that's what you would expect.

224
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,580
After all, why would prime numbers show some sort of preference for one last digit over

225
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
another?

226
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,300
But primes aren't random, they are a definite sequence, and show patterns in other ways,

227
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,700
and it's highly non-obvious how you would prove something like this.

228
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,660
Or for that matter, how do you rigorously phrase what it is you want to prove?

229
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,640
A mathematician might go about it something like this.

230
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,120
If you look at all the prime numbers less than some big number x, and you consider what

231
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,560
fraction of them are, say, 1 above a multiple of 10, that fraction should approach 1 fourth

232
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,760
as x approaches infinity, and likewise for all the other allowable residue classes, like

233
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,960
3 and 7 and 9.

234
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,060
Of course, there's nothing special about 10, a similar fact should hold for any other

235
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,060
number.

236
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,920
Considering our old friends the residue classes mod 44, for example, let's make a similar

237
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,600
histogram, showing what proportion of the primes show up in each one of these.

238
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:14,100
Again, as time goes on, we see an even spread between the 20 different allowable residue

239
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,820
classes, which you can think of in terms of each spiral arm from our diagram having about

240
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,320
the same number of primes as each of the others.

241
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,980
Maybe that's what you'd expect, but this is a shockingly hard fact to prove.

242
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,320
The first man who cracked this puzzle was Dirichlet in 1837, and it forms one of the

243
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,540
crowning jewels at the foundation of modern analytic number theory.

244
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,840
Histograms like these ones give a pretty good illustration of what the theorem is actually

245
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
saying.

246
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Nevertheless, you might find it enlightening to see how it might be written in a math text,

247
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,560
with all the fancy jargon and everything.

248
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,040
It's essentially what we just saw for 10, but more general.

249
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,280
Again, you look at all the primes up to some bound x, but instead of asking for what proportion

250
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,420
of them have a residue of, say, 1 mod 10, you ask what proportion have a residue of

251
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,640
r mod n, where n is any number, and r is anything that's co-primed to n.

252
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Remember, that means it doesn't share any factors with n bigger than 1.

253
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,920
Instead of approaching 1 fourth as x goes to infinity, that proportion goes to 1 divided

254
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,020
by phi of n, where phi is that special function I mentioned earlier that gives the number

255
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,600
of possible residues co-primed to n.

256
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,320
In case this is too clear for the reader, you might see it buried in more notation,

257
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,680
where this denominator and the numerator are both written with a special prime-counting

258
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
function.

259
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,960
The convention, rather confusingly, is to use the symbol pi for this function, even

260
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,360
though it's totally unrelated to the number pi.

261
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,520
In some contexts, when people refer to Dirichlet's theorem, they refer to a much more modest

262
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,940
statement, which is simply that each of these residue classes that might have infinitely

263
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,300
many primes does have infinitely many.

264
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,440
In order to prove this, what Dirichlet did was show that the primes are just as dense

265
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,620
in any one of these residue classes as in any other.

266
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,040
For example, imagine someone asked you to prove that there are infinitely many primes

267
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,120
ending in the number 1, and the way you do it is by showing that a quarter of all the

268
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,320
primes end in a 1.

269
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,340
Together with the fact that there are infinitely many primes, which we've known since Euclid,

270
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,040
this gives a stronger statement, and a much more interesting one.

271
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,520
Now the proof, well, it's way more involved than would be reasonable to show here.

272
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,240
One interesting fact worth mentioning is that it relies heavily on complex analysis, which

273
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,480
is the study of doing calculus with functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers.

274
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,720
Now that might seem weird, right?

275
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,260
Prime numbers seem wholly unrelated to the continuous world of calculus, much less when

276
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,220
complex numbers end up in the mix, but since the early 19th century, this is absolutely

277
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,420
par for the course when it comes to understanding how primes are distributed.

278
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,280
And this isn't just antiquated technology either.

279
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,840
Understanding the distribution of primes in residue classes like this continues to be

280
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,140
relevant in modern research too.

281
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,500
Some of the recent breakthroughs on small gaps between primes, edging towards that ever-elusive

282
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,580
twin-prime conjecture, have their basis in understanding how primes split up among these

283
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,380
kinds of residue classes.

284
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,140
Okay, looking back over the puzzle, I want to emphasize something.

285
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,340
The original bit of data visualization whimsy that led to these patterns?

286
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,980
Well, it doesn't matter, no one cares.

287
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,300
There's nothing special about plotting p,p in polar coordinates, and most of the

288
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,420
initial mystery in these spirals resulted from the artifacts that come from dealing

289
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,940
with integer number of radians, which is kind of weird.

290
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,700
But on the other hand, this kind of play is clearly worth it if the end result is a line

291
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,380
of questions that leads you to something like Dirichlet's theorem, which is important,

292
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,340
especially if it inspires you to learn enough to understand the tactics of the underlying

293
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,500
proof.

294
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,620
No small task, by the way.

295
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,420
And this isn't a coincidence that a fairly random question like this can lead you to

296
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,900
an important and deep fact for math.

297
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,020
What it means for a piece of math to be important and deep is that it connects to many other

298
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,540
topics.

299
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,300
So even an arbitrary exploration of numbers, as long as it's not too arbitrary, has a

300
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,140
good chance of stumbling into something meaningful.

301
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,300
Sure, you'll get a much more concentrated dosage of important facts by going through

302
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,420
a textbook or course, and there will be many fewer uninteresting dead ends, but there is

303
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,820
something special about rediscovering these topics on your own.

304
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,300
If you effectively reinvent Euler's totient function before you've ever seen it defined,

305
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,020
or if you start wondering about rational approximations before learning about continued fractions,

306
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,300
or if you seriously explore how primes are divvied up between residue classes before

307
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,860
you've even heard the name Dirichlet, then when you do learn those topics you'll see

308
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,220
them as familiar friends, not as arbitrary definitions.

309
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,100
And that will almost certainly mean that you learn it more effectively.
