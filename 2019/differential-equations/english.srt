00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Taking a quote from Stephen Strogatz, since Newton, mankind has come to realize that the

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,240
laws of physics are always expressed in the language of differential equations.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,220
Of course, this language is spoken well beyond the boundaries of physics as well, and being

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,280
able to speak it and read it adds a new color to how you view the world around you.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,060
In the next few videos, I want to give a sort of tour of this topic.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,140
The aim is to give a big picture view of what this piece of math is all about, while at

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,980
the same time being happy to dig into the details of specific examples as they come

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,980
along.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,860
I'll be assuming you know the basics of calculus, like what derivatives and integrals

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,180
are, and in later videos we'll need some basic linear algebra, but not too much beyond

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,900
that.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,580
Differential equations arise whenever it's easier to describe change than absolute amounts.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,860
It's easier to say why population sizes, for example, row or shrink, than it is to

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,500
describe why they have the particular values they do at some point in time.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,540
It may be easier to describe why your love for someone is changing than why it happens

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,220
to be where it is now.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,620
In physics, more specifically Newtonian mechanics, motion is often described in terms of force,

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,380
and force determines acceleration, which is a statement about change.

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,740
These equations come in two different flavors, ordinary differential equations, or ODEs,

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,700
involving functions with a single input, often thought of as time, and partial differential

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,980
equations, or PDEs, dealing with functions that have multiple inputs.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Partial differential equations are something we'll be looking at more closely in the

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,180
next video.

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,060
You often think of them as involving a whole continuum of values changing with time, like

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,840
the temperature at every point of a solid body, or the velocity of a fluid at every

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,960
point in space.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,240
Primary differential equations, our focus for now, involve only a finite collection

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
of values changing with time.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,320
And it doesn't have to be time per se, your one independent variable could be something

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,360
else, but things changing with time are the prototypical and most common example of differential

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,280
equations.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,560
Physics offers a nice playground for us here, with simple examples to start with, and no

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,720
shortage of intricacy and nuance as we delve deeper.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,000
As a nice warm up, consider the trajectory of something you throw in the air.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,640
The force of gravity near the surface of Earth causes things to accelerate downward at 9.8

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,800
meters per second per second.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,240
Now, unpack what that's really saying.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,920
It means if you look at that object free from other forces, and record its velocity at every

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,200
second, these velocity vectors will accrue an additional downward component of 9.8 meters

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,680
per second every second.

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,240
We call this constant 9.8 g for gravity.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,980
This is enough to give us an example of a differential equation, albeit a relatively

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,440
simple one.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,560
Focus on the y-coordinate as a function of time.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,200
Its derivative gives the vertical component of velocity, whose derivative in turn gives

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,240
the vertical component of acceleration.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,440
For compactness, let's write the first derivative as y-dot, and the second derivative

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,240
as y-double-dot.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,280
Our equation says that y-double-dot is equal to negative g, a simple constant.

50
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,000
This is one we can solve by integrating, which is essentially working the question backwards.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,200
First, to find velocity, you ask, what function has negative g as a derivative?

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,480
Well it's negative g times t, or more specifically, negative gt plus the initial velocity.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Notice there's many functions with this particular derivative, so you have an extra degree of

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,960
freedom which is determined by an initial condition.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,200
Now, what function has this as a derivative?

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,040
It turns out to be negative one-half g times t-squared, plus that initial velocity times

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,760
t, and again we're free to add an additional constant without changing the derivative,

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,400
and that constant is determined by whatever the initial position is.

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,000
And there you go, we just solved a differential equation, figuring out what a function is

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,440
based on information about its rate of change.

61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,160
Things get more interesting when the forces acting on a body depend on where that body

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,380
is.

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,860
For example, studying the motion of planets, stars, and moons, gravity can no longer be

64
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,680
considered a constant.

65
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,260
Given two bodies, the pole on one of them is in the direction of the other, with a strength

66
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,180
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

67
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,780
As always, the rate of change of position is velocity, but now the rate of change of

68
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,420
velocity, acceleration, is some function of position, so you have this dance between two

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,740
mutually interacting variables, reminiscent of the dance between the two moving bodies

70
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,620
which they describe.

71
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,460
This is reflective of the fact that often in differential equations, the puzzles you

72
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,940
face involve finding a function whose derivative and or higher order derivatives are defined

73
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,580
in terms of the function itself.

74
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,660
In physics, it's most common to work with second order differential equations, which

75
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,100
means the highest derivative you find in this expression is a second derivative.

76
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,900
Higher order differential equations would be ones involving third derivatives, fourth

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,820
derivatives, and so on, puzzles with more intricate clues.

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,940
The sensation you get when really meditating on one of these equations is one of solving

79
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,860
an infinite continuous jigsaw puzzle.

80
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,660
In a sense, you have to find infinitely many numbers, one for each point in time t, but

81
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,140
they're constrained by a very specific way that these values intertwine with their own

82
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,700
rate of change, and the rate of change of that rate of change.

83
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,060
To get a feel for what studying these can look like, I want you to take some time digging

84
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,180
into a deceptively simple example, a pendulum.

85
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,240
How does this angle theta that it makes with the vertical change as a function of time?

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,140
This is often given as an example in introductory physics classes of harmonic motion, meaning

87
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,680
it oscillates like a sine wave.

88
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,300
More specifically, one with a period of 2 pi times the square root of l over g, where

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,020
l is the length of the pendulum and g is the strength of gravity.

90
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,100
However, these formulas are actually lies, or rather, approximations which only work

91
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,060
in the realm of small angles.

92
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,240
If you were to go and measure an actual pendulum, what you'd find is that as you pull it out

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:44,020
farther, the period is longer than what the high school physics formulas would suggest.

94
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,740
And when you pull it out really far, this value of theta plotted versus time doesn't

95
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,180
even look like a sine wave anymore.

96
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,740
To understand what's really going on, first things first, let's set up the differential

97
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
equation.

98
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,180
We'll measure the position of the pendulum's weight as a distance x along this arc, and

99
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,860
if the angle theta we care about is measured in radians, we can write x as l times theta,

100
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,420
where l is the length of the pendulum.

101
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,580
As usual, gravity pulls down with an acceleration of g, but because the pendulum constrains

102
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,420
the motion of this mass, we have to look at the component of this acceleration in the

103
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
direction of motion.

104
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,600
A little geometry exercise for you is to show that this little angle here is the same as

105
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,200
theta.

106
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:42,260
So the component of gravity in the direction of motion opposite this angle will be negative

107
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,420
g times sine of theta.

108
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,260
Here we're considering theta to be positive when the pendulum is swung to the right, and

109
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,460
negative when it's swung to the left, and this minus sign in the acceleration indicates

110
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,720
that it's always pointed in the opposite direction from displacement.

111
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,880
So what we have is that the second derivative of x, the acceleration, is negative g times

112
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,660
sine of theta.

113
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,280
As always, it's nice to do a quick gut check that our formula makes physical sense.

114
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,400
When theta is zero, sine of zero is zero, so there's no acceleration in the direction

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
of movement.

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,740
When theta is 90 degrees, sine of theta is 1, so the acceleration is the same as it would

117
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,980
be for freefall.

118
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,500
Alright, that checks out.

119
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,340
Because x is l times theta, that means the second derivative of theta is negative g over

120
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,380
l times sine of theta.

121
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,820
To be a little more realistic, let's add in a term to account for the air resistance,

122
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,660
which maybe we model as being proportional to the velocity.

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,660
We'll write this as negative mu times theta dot, where mu is some constant that encapsulates

124
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,320
all of the air resistance and friction and such that determines how quickly the pendulum

125
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,060
loses energy.

126
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,020
Now this, my friends, is a particularly juicy differential equation.

127
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,660
It's not easy to solve, but it's not so hard that we can't reasonably get some meaningful

128
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,420
understanding out of it.

129
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,060
At first glance, you might think that the sine function you see here relates to the

130
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,940
sine wave pattern for the pendulum.

131
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,300
Ironically, though, what you'll eventually find is that the opposite is true.

132
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,720
The presence of the sine in this equation is precisely why real pendulums don't oscillate

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,540
with a sine wave pattern.

134
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,260
If that sounds odd, consider the fact that here, the sine function is taking theta as

135
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,660
an input, but in the approximate solution you might see in a physics class, theta itself

136
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,980
is oscillating as the output of a sine function.

137
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,660
Clearly something fishy is afoot.

138
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,620
One thing I like about this example is that, even though it's comparatively simple, it

139
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,980
exposes an important truth about differential equations that you need to grapple with.

140
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,440
They're really freaking hard to solve.

141
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,860
In this case, if we remove that dampening term, we can just barely write down an analytic

142
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,900
solution, but it's hilariously complicated.

143
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,620
It involves all these functions you've probably never heard of, written in terms of integrals

144
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,900
and weird inverse integral problems.

145
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,060
When you step back, presumably the reason for finding a solution is to then be able

146
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,140
to make computations and build an understanding for whatever dynamics you're studying.

147
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,700
In this case, those questions have been punted off to figuring out how to compute, and more

148
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,300
importantly, understand, these new functions.

149
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,100
And more often, like if we add back in that dampening term, there's not a known way

150
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,900
to write down an exact analytic solution.

151
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,780
Well, for any hard problem you could just define a new function to be the answer to

152
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,340
that problem, heck, even name it after yourself if you want.

153
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,220
But again, that's pointless unless it leads you to being able to make computations and

154
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,460
to build understanding.

155
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,660
So instead, in the study of differential equations, we often do a sort of short circuit, and skip

156
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,580
the actual solution part, since it's unattainable, and go straight to building understanding

157
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,180
and making computations from the equations alone.

158
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,900
Let me walk through what that might look like with a pendulum.

159
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,620
What do you hold in your head, or what visualization can you get some software to pull up for you,

160
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,420
to understand the many possible ways that a pendulum, governed by these laws, might

161
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,780
evolve depending on its starting conditions?

162
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,580
You might be tempted to try imagining the graph of theta vs. t, and somehow interpreting

163
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,300
how this slope, position, and curvature all interrelate with each other.

164
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,740
However, what will turn out to be both easier and more general is to start by visualizing

165
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,220
all possible states in a two-dimensional plane.

166
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,180
What I mean by the state of the pendulum is that you can describe it with two numbers,

167
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,940
the angle and the angular velocity.

168
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,100
You can freely change either one of those two values without necessarily changing the

169
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,220
other, but the acceleration is purely a function of those two values.

170
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,060
So each point of this two-dimensional plane fully describes the pendulum at any given

171
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,360
moment.

172
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,900
You might think of these as all possible initial conditions of that pendulum.

173
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,420
If you know the initial angle and the angular velocity, that's enough to predict how the

174
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,340
system will evolve as time moves forward.

175
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,700
If you haven't worked with them before, these sorts of diagrams can take a little

176
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,180
getting used to.

177
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,340
What you're looking at now, this inward spiral, is a fairly typical trajectory for

178
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:30,260
our pendulum, so take a moment to think carefully about what is being represented.

179
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:37,080
Notice how at the start, as theta decreases, theta dot, the y-coordinate, gets more negative.

180
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,180
Which makes sense, because the pendulum moves faster in the leftward direction as it approaches

181
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,700
the bottom.

182
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,140
Keep in mind, even though the velocity vector on this pendulum is pointed to the left, the

183
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,100
value of that velocity is always being represented by the vertical component of our space.

184
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,000
It's important to remind yourself that this state space is an abstract thing, and is distinct

185
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,140
from the physical space where the pendulum itself moves.

186
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,620
Since we're modeling this as losing some of its energy to air resistance, this trajectory

187
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,180
spirals inward, meaning the peak velocity and peak displacement each go down a bit with

188
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,780
each swing.

189
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,260
Our point is, in a sense, attracted to the origin, where theta and theta dot both equal

190
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,260
0.

191
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,100
With this space, we can visualize a differential equation as a vector field.

192
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
Here, let me show you what I mean.

193
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,720
The pendulum state is a vector, theta, theta dot.

194
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,820
Maybe you think of that as an arrow from the origin, or maybe you think of it as a point.

195
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,100
What matters is that it has two coordinates, each a function of time.

196
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,980
Using the derivative of that vector gives you its rate of change, the direction and

197
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,700
speed that it will tend to move in this diagram.

198
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,580
That derivative is a new vector, theta dot theta double dot, which we visualize as being

199
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,020
attached to the relevant point in space.

200
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,460
Take a moment to interpret what this is saying.

201
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,540
The first component for this rate of change vector is theta dot, which is also a coordinate

202
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,260
in our space.

203
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,420
The higher up we are in the diagram, the more the point tends to move to the right, and

204
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,580
the lower we are, the more it tends to move to the left.

205
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,420
The vertical component is theta double dot, which lets us rewrite entirely in terms of

206
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,000
theta and theta dot itself.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,940
In other words, the first derivative of our state vector is some function of that vector

208
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,060
itself, with most of the intricacy tied up in that second coordinate.

209
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,500
Doing the same at all points of this space will show how that state tends to change from

210
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,260
any position.

211
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,280
As is typical with vector fields, we artificially scale down the vectors when we draw them to

212
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,100
prevent clutter, but use color to loosely indicate magnitude.

213
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,200
Notice, we've effectively broken up a single second-order equation into a system of two

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,280
first-order equations.

215
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,060
You might even give theta dot a different name, to emphasize that we're really thinking

216
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,380
of two separate values, intertwined via this mutual effect they have on one another's

217
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,960
rate of change.

218
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,100
This is a common trick in the study of differential equations.

219
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,480
Instead of thinking about higher order changes of a single value, we often prefer to think

220
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,060
of the first derivative of vector values.

221
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,520
In this form, we have a wonderful visual way to think about what solving the equation means.

222
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,220
As our system evolves from some initial state, our point in this space will move along some

223
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,100
trajectory in such a way that at every moment, the velocity of that point matches the vector

224
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,820
from this field.

225
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,320
And again, keep in mind, this velocity is not the same thing as the physical velocity

226
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,180
of the pendulum, it's a more abstract rate of change, encoding the rates of change for

227
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,340
both theta and theta dot.

228
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,980
You might find it fun to pause for a moment and think through what exactly some of these

229
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,900
trajectory lines say about the possible ways that the pendulum evolves from different starting

230
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,700
conditions.

231
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,740
For example, in regions where theta dot is quite high, the vectors guide the point to

232
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,880
travel to the right quite a ways, before settling down into an inward spiral.

233
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,380
This corresponds to a pendulum with a high enough initial velocity that it fully rotates

234
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,800
around several times before settling into a decaying back and forth.

235
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,160
Something a little more fun, when I tweak this air resistance term, mu, say increasing

236
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,620
it, you can immediately see how this will result in trajectories that spiral inward

237
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,400
faster, which is to say the pendulum slows down faster.

238
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,680
That's obvious when I call it the air resistance term, but imagine that you saw these equations

239
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,180
out of context, not knowing that they described a pendulum.

240
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,960
It's not obvious just looking at them that increasing this value of mu means that the

241
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,440
system as a whole tends towards some attracting state faster.

242
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,320
So getting some software to draw these vector fields for you can be a great way to build

243
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,480
an intuition for how they behave.

244
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,920
What's wonderful is that any system of ordinary differential equations can be described by

245
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,320
a vector field like this, so it's a very general way to get a feel for them.

246
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,000
Usually, though, they have many more dimensions.

247
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,800
For example, consider the famous three-body problem, which is to predict how three masses

248
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,320
in three-dimensional space evolve if they act on each other with gravity, and if you

249
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,480
know their initial positions and velocities.

250
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,200
Each mass has three coordinates describing its position, and three more describing its

251
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
momentum.

252
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,680
So the system has 18 degrees of freedom in total, and hence an 18-dimensional space of

253
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,120
possible states.

254
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,240
It's a bizarre thought, isn't it?

255
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,920
A single point meandering through an 18-dimensional space that we cannot visualize, obediently

256
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,480
taking steps through time based on whatever vector it happens to be sitting on from moment

257
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,400
to moment, completely encoding the positions and the momenta of the three masses we see

258
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,760
in ordinary physical 3D space.

259
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,360
In practice, you can reduce the number of dimensions here by taking advantage of the

260
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,600
symmetries of your setup, but the point that more degrees of freedom results in higher

261
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,560
dimensional state spaces remains the same.

262
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,760
In math, we often call a space like this a phase space.

263
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,560
You'll hear me use that term broadly for spaces encoding all kinds of states of changing

264
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,920
systems, but you should know that in the context of physics, especially Hamiltonian mechanics,

265
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,840
the term is often reserved for a more special case, namely a space whose axes represent

266
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,040
position and momentum.

267
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,920
So a physicist would agree that the 18-dimensional space describing the three-body problem is

268
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,240
a phase space, but they might ask that we make a couple of modifications to our pendulum

269
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,240
setup for it to properly deserve the term.

270
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,680
For those of you who just watched the block collision video, the planes we worked with

271
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,680
there would be called phase spaces by math folk, though a physicist might prefer other

272
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,000
terminology.

273
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Just know that the specific meaning may depend on your context.

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,360
It may seem like a simple idea, depending on how well indoctrinated you are to modern

275
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,620
ways of thinking about math, but it's worth keeping in mind that it took humanity quite

276
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,200
a while to really embrace thinking of dynamics spatially like this, especially when the dimensions

277
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,120
get very large.

278
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,240
In his book Chaos, the author James Glick describes phase space as,

279
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,760
"...one of the most powerful inventions of modern science.

280
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,440
One reason it's powerful is that you can ask questions not just about a single initial

281
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,480
condition but about a whole spectrum of initial states.

282
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,320
The collection of all possible trajectories is reminiscent of a moving fluid, so we call

283
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,120
it phase flow."

284
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,920
To take one example of why phase flow is a fruitful idea, consider the question of stability.

285
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,920
The origin of our space corresponds to the pendulum standing still, and so does this

286
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,000
point over here, representing when the pendulum is perfectly balanced upright.

287
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,360
These are the so-called fixed points of our system, and one natural question to ask is

288
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,300
whether or not they're stable.

289
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,920
That is, will tiny nudges to the system result in a state that tends back towards that fixed

290
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,520
point, or away from it?

291
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,200
Physical intuition for the pendulum makes the answer here kind of obvious, but how would

292
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,280
you think about stability just looking at the equations, say if they arose in some completely

293
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,480
different less intuitive context?

294
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,240
We'll go over how to compute the answers to questions like this in following videos,

295
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
and the intuition for the relevant computations are guided heavily by the thought of looking

296
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,900
at small regions in space around a fixed point, and asking whether the flow tends to contract

297
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,280
or expand.

298
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
And speaking of attraction and stability, let's take a brief sidestep to talk about

299
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
love.

300
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,080
The Strogatz quote that I mentioned earlier comes from a whimsical column in the New York

301
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,120
Times on the mathematics of modeling affection, an example well worth pilfering to illustrate

302
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
that we're not just talking about physics here.

303
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,620
Imagine you've been flirting with someone, but there's been some frustrating inconsistency

304
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,440
to how mutual your affection seems, and perhaps during a moment when you turn your attention

305
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,440
towards physics to keep your mind off the romantic turmoil, mulling over the broken

306
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,720
up pendulum equations, you suddenly understand the on-again-off-again dynamics of your flirtation.

307
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,420
You've noticed that your own affection tends to increase when your companion seems interested

308
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,160
in you, but decrease when they seem colder.

309
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,320
That is, the rate of change for your love is proportional to their feelings for you.

310
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,880
But this sweetheart of yours is precisely the opposite, strangely attracted to you when

311
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,480
you seem uninterested, but turned off once you seem too keen.

312
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,880
The phase space for these equations looks very similar to the center part of your pendulum

313
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
diagram.

314
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:59,160
The two of you will go back and forth between affection and repulsion in an endless cycle.

315
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,160
A metaphor of pendulum swings in your feelings would not just be apt, but mathematically

316
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
verified.

317
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,440
In fact, if your partner's feelings were further slowed when they feel themselves too

318
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,880
in love, let's say out of a fear of being made vulnerable, we'd have a term matching

319
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,360
the friction in the pendulum, and you too would be destined to an inward spiral towards

320
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,000
mutual ambivalence.

321
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
I hear wedding bells already.

322
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,840
The point is that two very different seeming laws of dynamics, one from physics, involving

323
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,360
a single variable, and another from, uh, chemistry, with two variables, actually have a very similar

324
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,120
structure, easier to recognize when you're looking at the phase diagram.

325
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,440
Most notably, even though the equations are different, for example there's no sine function

326
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,400
in the romance equations, the phase space exposes an underlying similarity nevertheless.

327
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,360
In other words, you're not just studying a pendulum right now, the tactics you develop

328
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,560
to study one case have a tendency to transfer to many others.

329
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,200
Okay, so phase diagrams are a nice way to build understanding, but what about actually

330
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,640
computing the answer to our equation?

331
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,220
One way to do this is to essentially simulate what the universe would do, but using finite

332
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,440
time steps instead of the infinitesimals and limits defining calculus.

333
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,320
The basic idea is that if you're at some point in this phase diagram, take a step based

334
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,520
on the vector you're sitting on for a small time step, delta t.

335
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,960
Specifically, take a step equal to delta t times that vector.

336
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,320
As a reminder, in drawing these vector fields, the magnitude for each vector has been artificially

337
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,240
scaled down to prevent clutter.

338
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,160
When you do this repeatedly, your final location will be an approximation of theta t, where

339
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,520
t is the sum of all those time steps.

340
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,880
If you think about what's being shown right now, though, and what that would imply for

341
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,520
the pendulum's movement, you'd probably agree that this is grossly inaccurate.

342
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,360
But that's only because the time step delta t of 0.5 is way too big.

343
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,520
If we turned it down, say to 0.01, you can get a much more accurate approximation, it

344
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,920
just takes more repeated steps.

345
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,040
In this case, computing theta of 10 requires 1000 little steps.

346
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Luckily, we live in a world with computers, so repeating a simple task 1000 times is as

347
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,800
simple as articulating that task with a programming language.

348
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,680
In fact, let's finish things off by writing a little python program that computes theta

349
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,320
of t for us.

350
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,040
What it has to do is make use of the differential equation, which returns the second derivative

351
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,320
of theta, as a function of theta and theta dot.

352
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,520
You start off by defining two variables, theta and theta dot, each in terms of some initial

353
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
conditions.

354
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,520
In this case I'll have theta start at pi thirds, which is 60 degrees, and theta dot

355
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,000
start at 0.

356
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,360
Next, write a loop that corresponds to taking many little time steps between 0 and time

357
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,720
t, each of size delta t, which I'm setting here to be 0.01.

358
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,600
In each step of this loop, increase theta by theta dot times delta t, and increase theta

359
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,120
dot by theta double dot times delta t, where theta double dot can be computed based on

360
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,440
the differential equation.

361
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,760
After all these little time steps, simply return the value of theta.

362
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,360
This is called solving a differential equation numerically.

363
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,960
Numerical methods can get way more sophisticated and intricate than this to better balance

364
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,600
the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, but this loop gives the basic idea.

365
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,040
So even though it sucks that we can't always find exact solutions, there are still meaningful

366
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,000
ways to study differential equations in the face of this inability.

367
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,800
In the following videos, we will look at several methods for finding exact solutions when it's

368
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,920
possible, but one theme I'd like to focus on is how these exact solutions can also help

369
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,960
us to study the more general, unsolvable cases.

370
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,920
But it gets worse.

371
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,040
Just as there's a limit to how far exact analytic solutions can get us, one of the

372
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,960
great fields to have emerged in the last century, chaos theory, has exposed that there are further

373
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,960
limits on how well we can use these systems for prediction with or without solutions.

374
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,680
Specifically, we know that for some systems, small variations to the initial conditions,

375
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,680
say the kind due to necessarily imperfect measurements, result in wildly different trajectories.

376
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,920
We've even built some good understanding for why this happens.

377
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,940
The three-body problem, for example, is known to have seeds of chaos within it.

378
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,600
So looking back at the quote from earlier, it seems almost cruel of the universe to fill

379
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,920
its language with riddles that we either can't solve, or where we know that any solution

380
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,120
would be useless for long-term prediction anyway.

381
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,040
It is cruel, but then again it should also be reassuring.

382
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,960
It gives some hope that the complexity we see in the world around us can be studied

383
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,440
somewhere in this math, and that it's not hidden away in the mismatch between model

384
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,160
and reality.
