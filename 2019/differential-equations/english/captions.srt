00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,273
Taking a quote from Stephen Strogatz, since Newton, 

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:10,593
mankind has come to realize that the laws of physics are always expressed in the 

3
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,460
language of differential equations.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,058
Of course, this language is spoken well beyond the boundaries of physics as well, 

5
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,289
and being able to speak it and read it adds a new color to how you view the world around 

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:21,480
you.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,400
In the next few videos, I want to give a sort of tour of this topic.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,630
The aim is to give a big picture view of what this piece of math is all about, 

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,852
while at the same time being happy to dig into the details of specific examples as they 

10
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:34,380
come along.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,520
I'll be assuming you know the basics of calculus, 

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,949
like what derivatives and integrals are, and in later videos we'll need some basic linear 

13
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:43,820
algebra, but not too much beyond that.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,259
Differential equations arise whenever it's easier 

15
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,440
to describe change than absolute amounts.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,597
It's easier to say why population sizes, for example, 

17
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:57,217
grow or shrink than it is to describe why they have the particular values they 

18
00:00:57,217 --> 00:00:58,680
do at some point in time.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,113
It may be easier to describe why your love for someone 

20
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:04,680
is changing than why it happens to be where it is now.

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,060
In physics, more specifically Newtonian mechanics, 

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,579
motion is often described in terms of force, and force determines acceleration, 

23
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,500
which is a statement about change.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,928
These equations come in two different flavors, ordinary differential equations, 

25
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:24,457
or ODEs, involving functions with a single input, often thought of as time, 

26
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:29,642
and partial differential equations, or PDEs, dealing with functions that have multiple 

27
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:30,060
inputs.

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,818
Partial differential equations are something we'll 

29
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:34,600
be looking at more closely in the next video.

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,934
You often think of them as involving a whole continuum of values changing with time, 

31
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,923
like the temperature at every point of a solid body, 

32
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,800
or the velocity of a fluid at every point in space.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,437
Ordinary differential equations, our focus for now, 

34
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:52,820
involve only a finite collection of values changing with time.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,881
And it doesn't have to be time per se, your one independent variable 

36
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,950
could be something else, but things changing with time are the 

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,020
prototypical and most common example of differential equations.

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,370
Physics offers a nice playground for us here, with simple examples to start with, 

39
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,500
and no shortage of intricacy and nuance as we delve deeper.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,360
As a nice warmup, consider the trajectory of something you throw in the air.

41
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,753
The force of gravity near the surface of Earth causes things 

42
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:25,500
to accelerate downward at 9.8 meters per second per second.

43
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,060
Now unpack what that's really saying.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,829
It means if you look at that object free from other forces, 

45
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:39,604
and record its velocity at every small downward component of 9.8 

46
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:46,000
meters per second every second, we call this constant 9.8 g for gravity.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,313
This is enough to give us an example of a differential equation, 

48
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:51,780
albeit a relatively simple one.

49
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,120
Focus on the y-coordinate as a function of time.

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,723
Its derivative gives the vertical component of velocity, 

51
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:07,180
whose derivative in turn gives the vertical component of acceleration.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,703
For compactness, let's write the first derivative 

53
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:15,420
as y-dot and the second derivative as y-double-dot.

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,320
Our equation says that y-double-dot is equal to negative g, a simple constant.

55
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,364
This is one we can solve by integrating, which 

56
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,580
is essentially working the question backwards.

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,340
First, to find velocity, you ask, what function has negative g as a derivative?

58
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,638
Well, it's negative g times t, or more specifically, 

59
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:39,720
negative gt plus the initial velocity.

60
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,484
Notice that there are many functions with this particular derivative, 

61
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:47,260
so you have an extra degree of freedom which is determined by an initial condition.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,860
Now what function has this as a derivative?

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,563
It turns out to be negative one-half g times t squared plus that initial velocity 

64
00:03:56,563 --> 00:04:01,149
times t, and again we're free to add an additional constant without changing the 

65
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:05,680
derivative, and that constant is determined by whatever the initial position is.

66
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,333
And there you go, we just solved a differential equation, 

67
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,360
figuring out what a function is based on information about its rate of change.

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,700
Things get more interesting when the forces acting on a body depend on where that body is.

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,914
For example, studying the motion of planets, stars, 

70
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:25,830
and moons, gravity can no longer be considered a constant.

71
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,983
Given two bodies, the pole on one of them is in the direction of the other, 

72
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:35,810
with a strength inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,558
As always, the rate of change of position is velocity, 

74
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:45,825
but now the rate of change of velocity, acceleration, is some function of position, 

75
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:50,027
so you have this dance between two mutually interacting variables, 

76
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:54,730
reminiscent of the dance between the two moving bodies which they describe.

77
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,062
This is reflective of the fact that often in differential equations, 

78
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:05,795
the puzzles you face involve finding a function whose derivative and 

79
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:09,690
or higher order derivatives are defined in terms of the function itself.

80
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,580
In physics it's most common to work with second order differential equations, 

81
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,090
which means the highest derivative you find in this expression is a second derivative.

82
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,216
Higher order differential equations would be ones involving third derivatives, 

83
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:27,810
fourth derivatives, and so on, puzzles with more intricate clues.

84
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,889
The sensation you get when really meditating on one of these 

85
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,150
equations is one of solving an infinite continuous jigsaw puzzle.

86
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,760
In a sense, you have to find infinitely many numbers, one for each point in time t, 

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,572
but they're constrained by a very specific way that these values intertwine with 

88
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:49,850
their own rate of change, and the rate of change of that rate of change.

89
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,196
To get a feel for what studying these can look like, 

90
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:57,310
I want you to take some time digging into a deceptively simple example, a pendulum.

91
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,110
How does this angle theta that it makes with the vertical change as a function of time?

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,667
This is often given as an example in introductory physics classes of harmonic motion, 

93
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,770
meaning it oscillates like a sine wave.

94
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,279
More specifically, one with a period of 2 pi times the square root of l over g, 

95
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,170
where l is the length of the pendulum and g is the strength of gravity.

96
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,902
However, these formulas are actually lies, or rather, 

97
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:29,450
approximations which only work in the realm of small angles.

98
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,716
If you were to go and measure an actual pendulum, 

99
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:35,594
what you'd find is that as you pull it out farther, 

100
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:39,910
the period is longer than what the high school physics formulas would suggest.

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,027
And when you pull it out really far, this value of theta 

102
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:50,650
plotted versus time doesn't even look like a sine wave anymore.

103
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,469
To understand what's really going on, first things first, 

104
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:59,190
let's set up the differential equation.

105
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,740
We'll measure the position of the pendulum's weight as a distance x along this arc, 

106
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,349
and if the angle theta we care about is measured in radians, 

107
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:12,550
we can write x as l times theta, where l is the length of the pendulum.

108
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,483
As usual, gravity pulls down with an acceleration of g, 

109
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,897
but because the pendulum constrains the motion of this mass, 

110
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:24,430
we have to look at the component of this acceleration in the direction of motion.

111
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,134
A little geometry exercise for you is to show 

112
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:31,270
that this little angle here is the same as theta.

113
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,574
So the component of gravity in the direction of motion 

114
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:44,470
opposite this angle will be negative g times sine of theta.

115
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,150
Here we're considering theta to be positive when the pendulum is swung to the right, 

116
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,090
and negative when it's swung to the left.

117
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,785
This minus sign in the acceleration indicates that it's 

118
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:59,090
always pointed in the opposite direction from displacement.

119
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,549
So what we have is that the second derivative of x, 

120
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,650
the acceleration, is negative g times sine of theta.

121
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,510
As always, it's nice to do a quick gut check that our formula makes physical sense.

122
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,214
When theta is zero, sine of zero is zero, so there's 

123
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,850
no acceleration in the direction of movement.

124
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,490
When theta is 90 degrees, sine of theta is 1, so the 

125
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,650
acceleration is the same as it would be for freefall.

126
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
Alright, that checks out.

127
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,094
And because x is L times theta, that means the second 

128
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:35,549
derivative of theta is negative g over L times sine of theta.

129
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,564
To be a little more realistic, let's add in a term to account for the air resistance, 

130
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:43,470
which maybe we model as being proportional to the velocity.

131
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,673
We'll write this as negative mu times theta dot, 

132
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:50,260
where mu is some constant that encapsulates all the air resistance 

133
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,330
and friction and such that determines how quickly the pendulum loses energy.

134
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,810
Now this, my friends, is a particularly juicy differential equation.

135
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,087
It's not easy to solve, but it's not so hard that we can't 

136
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,770
reasonably get some meaningful understanding out of it.

137
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,962
At first glance, you might think that the sine function you 

138
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:11,650
see here relates to the sine wave pattern for the pendulum.

139
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,790
Ironically, though, what you'll eventually find is that the opposite is true.

140
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,418
The presence of the sine in this equation is precisely 

141
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:22,810
why real pendulums don't oscillate with a sine wave pattern.

142
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,271
If that sounds odd, consider the fact that here, 

143
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,940
the sine function is taking theta as an input, 

144
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,686
but in the approximate solution you might see in a physics class, 

145
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:36,150
theta itself is oscillating as the output of a sine function.

146
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,550
Clearly something fishy is afoot.

147
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,375
One thing I like about this example is that, even though it's comparatively simple, 

148
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,630
it exposes an important truth about differential equations that you need to grapple with.

149
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,750
They're really freaking hard to solve.

150
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,253
In this case, if we remove that dampening term, 

151
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:58,430
we can just barely write down an analytic solution, but it's hilariously complicated.

152
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,853
It involves all these functions you've probably never heard of, 

153
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,910
written in terms of integrals and weird inverse integral problems.

154
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,574
When you step back, presumably the reason for finding a solution is to then be able 

155
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:14,350
to make computations and build an understanding for whatever dynamics you're studying.

156
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,363
In this case, those questions have been punted off to figuring out how to compute, 

157
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:22,170
and more importantly, understand, these new functions.

158
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,708
And more often, like if we add back in that dampening term, 

159
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:30,650
there's not a known way to write down an exact analytic solution.

160
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,570
Well, for any hard problem you could just define a new function to be the answer of 

161
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,341
that problem, heck, even name it after yourself if you want, but again, 

162
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:43,636
that's pointless unless it leads you to being able to make computations and build 

163
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:44,370
understanding.

164
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,170
So instead, in the study of differential equations, we often do a sort of short circuit, 

165
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,420
and skip the actual solution part, since it's unattainable, 

166
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,483
and go straight to building understanding and making computations from the 

167
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,350
equations alone.

168
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,310
Let me walk through what that might look like with a pendulum.

169
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,986
What do you hold in your head, or what visualization can you get some software 

170
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:10,898
to pull up for you, to understand the many possible ways that a pendulum, 

171
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:14,810
governed by these laws, might evolve depending on its starting conditions?

172
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,830
You might be tempted to try imagining the graph of theta vs.

173
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,071
t, and somehow interpreting how this slope, position, 

174
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:24,730
and curvature all interrelate with each other.

175
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,450
However, what will turn out to be both easier and more general is to 

176
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,590
start by visualizing all possible states in a two-dimensional plane.

177
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,611
What I mean by the state of the pendulum is that you can describe it with two numbers, 

178
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,390
the angle and the angular velocity.

179
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,839
You can freely change either one of those two values without necessarily 

180
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,230
changing the other, but the acceleration is purely a function of those two values.

181
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,990
So each point of this two-dimensional plane fully 

182
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,570
describes the pendulum at any given moment.

183
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,330
You might think of these as all possible initial conditions of that pendulum.

184
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,205
If you know the initial angle and the angular velocity, 

185
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:11,930
that's enough to predict how the system will evolve as time moves forward.

186
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,247
If you haven't worked with them before, these 

187
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,550
sorts of diagrams can take a little getting used to.

188
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,278
What you're looking at now, this inward spiral, 

189
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,064
is a fairly typical trajectory for our pendulum, 

190
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:27,930
so take a moment to think carefully about what is being represented.

191
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,791
Notice how at the start, as theta decreases, theta dot, 

192
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,250
the y-coordinate, gets more negative.

193
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,823
Which makes sense, because the pendulum moves faster 

194
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:42,710
in the leftward direction as it approaches the bottom.

195
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,511
Keep in mind, even though the velocity vector on this pendulum is pointed to the left, 

196
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,793
the value of that velocity is always being represented by 

197
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:53,830
the vertical component of our space.

198
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,856
It's important to remind yourself that this state space is an abstract thing, 

199
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:02,850
and is distinct from the physical space where the pendulum itself moves.

200
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,102
Since we're modeling this as losing some of its energy to air resistance, 

201
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:12,708
this trajectory spirals inward, meaning the peak velocity and 

202
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,790
peak displacement each go down a bit with each swing.

203
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,610
Our point is, in a sense, attracted to the origin, where theta and theta dot both equal 0.

204
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,910
With this space, we can visualize a differential equation as a vector field.

205
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,630
Here, let me show you what I mean.

206
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,030
The pendulum state is a vector, theta, theta dot.

207
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,310
Maybe you think of that as an arrow from the origin, or maybe you think of it as a point.

208
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,670
What matters is that it has two coordinates, each a function of time.

209
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,234
Taking the derivative of that vector gives you its rate of change, 

210
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:52,730
the direction and speed that it will tend to move in this diagram.

211
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,121
That derivative is a new vector, theta dot theta double dot, 

212
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:00,970
which we visualize as being attached to the relevant point in space.

213
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,670
Take a moment to interpret what this is saying.

214
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,997
The first component for this rate of change vector is theta dot, 

215
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:12,230
which is also a coordinate in our space.

216
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,853
The higher up we are in the diagram, the more the point tends to move to the right, 

217
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:21,470
and the lower we are, the more it tends to move to the left.

218
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,168
The vertical component is theta double dot, which our differential 

219
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:32,350
equation lets us rewrite entirely in terms of theta and theta dot itself.

220
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,014
In other words, the first derivative of our state vector is some function of 

221
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:41,290
that vector itself, with most of the intricacy tied up in that second coordinate.

222
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,397
Doing the same at all points of this space will show 

223
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,270
how that state tends to change from any position.

224
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,983
As is typical with vector fields, we artificially scale down the vectors when 

225
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:55,650
we draw them to prevent clutter, but use color to loosely indicate magnitude.

226
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,390
Notice we've effectively broken up a single second-order 

227
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,530
equation into a system of two first-order equations.

228
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,723
You might even give theta dot a different name, 

229
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:10,049
to emphasize that we're really thinking of two separate values, 

230
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:14,050
intertwined via this mutual effect they have on one another's rate of change.

231
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,390
This is a common trick in the study of differential equations.

232
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,480
Instead of thinking about higher order changes of a single value, 

233
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,110
we often prefer to think of the first derivative of vector values.

234
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,464
In this form, we have a wonderful visual way to 

235
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,770
think about what solving the equation means.

236
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,231
As our system evolves from some initial state, 

237
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:38,473
our point in this space will move along some trajectory in such a 

238
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:44,130
way that at every moment, the velocity of that point matches the vector from this field.

239
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,455
And again, keep in mind, this velocity is not the same thing as 

240
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:52,808
the physical velocity of the pendulum, it's a more abstract rate of change, 

241
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:56,130
encoding the rates of change for both theta and theta dot.

242
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,219
You might find it fun to pause for a moment and think through 

243
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:03,449
what exactly some of these trajectory lines say about the possible 

244
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:06,390
ways the pendulum evolves from different starting conditions.

245
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,628
For example, in regions where theta dot is quite high, 

246
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:17,280
the vectors guide the point to travel to the right quite a ways before settling 

247
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,850
down into an inward spiral.

248
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,883
This corresponds to a pendulum with a high enough initial velocity that it 

249
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:28,490
fully rotates around several times before settling into a decaying back and forth.

250
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,770
Having a little more fun?

251
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,147
When I tweak this air resistance term, mu, say increasing it, 

252
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:42,650
you can immediately see how this will result in trajectories that spiral inward faster, 

253
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,590
which is to say the pendulum slows down faster.

254
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,921
That's obvious when I call it the air resistance term, 

255
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:53,490
but imagine you saw these equations out of context, not knowing they described a pendulum.

256
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,300
It's not obvious just looking at them that increasing this value of mu 

257
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,590
means the system as a whole tends towards some attracting state faster.

258
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,240
So getting some software to draw these vector fields for you 

259
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,089
can be a great way to build an intuition for how they behave.

260
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,105
What's wonderful is that any system of ordinary differential equations can be 

261
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:18,869
described by a vector field like this, so it's a very general way to get a feel for them.

262
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,089
Usually, though, they have many more dimensions.

263
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,563
For example, consider the famous three-body problem, 

264
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:29,533
which is to predict how three masses in three-dimensional space evolve if 

265
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:33,665
they act on each other with gravity, and if you know their initial positions 

266
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:34,470
and velocities.

267
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,425
Each mass has three coordinates describing its position, 

268
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,570
and three more describing its momentum.

269
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,386
So the system has 18 degrees of freedom in total, 

270
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:47,690
and hence an 18-dimensional space of possible states.

271
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,970
It's a bizarre thought, isn't it?

272
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,978
A single point meandering through an 18-dimensional space that we cannot visualize, 

273
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:59,273
obediently taking steps through time based on whatever vector it happens to 

274
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:03,513
be sitting on from moment to moment, completely encoding the positions and 

275
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:07,470
the momenta of the three masses we see in ordinary, physical 3D space.

276
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,852
In practice, you can reduce the number of dimensions here by taking 

277
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:15,008
advantage of the symmetries of your setup, but the point that more 

278
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:18,730
degrees of freedom results in higher dimensional state spaces remains the same.

279
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,530
In math, we often call a space like this a phase space.

280
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,904
You'll hear me use that term broadly for spaces encoding all kinds of 

281
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:33,263
states of changing systems, but you should know that in the context of physics, 

282
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:37,949
especially Hamiltonian mechanics, the term is often reserved for a more special case, 

283
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:41,110
namely a space whose axes represent position and momentum.

284
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,563
So a physicist would agree that the 18-dimensional space describing the 

285
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:49,543
three-body problem is a phase space, but they might ask that we make a couple 

286
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:53,370
of modifications to our pendulum setup for it to properly deserve the term.

287
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,201
For those of you who just watched the block collision video, 

288
00:18:57,201 --> 00:19:00,830
the planes we worked with there would be called phase spaces by math folk, 

289
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,250
though a physicist might prefer other terminology.

290
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,830
Just know that the specific meaning may depend on your context.

291
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,699
It may seem like a simple idea, depending on how well indoctrinated you 

292
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:15,636
are to modern ways of thinking about math, but it's worth keeping in mind 

293
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:19,625
that it took humanity quite a while to really embrace thinking of dynamics 

294
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,190
spatially like this, especially when the dimensions get very large.

295
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:35,775
In his book Chaos, the author James Glick describes phase space as, 

296
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:45,912
To take one example of why phase flow is a fruitful idea, 

297
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:52,030
consider the question of stability.

298
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,664
The origin of our space corresponds to the pendulum standing still, 

299
00:19:56,664 --> 00:20:00,971
and so does this point over here, representing when the pendulum is perfectly 

300
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:01,910
balanced upright.

301
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,618
These are the so-called fixed points of our system, 

302
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:09,727
and one natural question to ask is whether or not they're stable, that is, 

303
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:14,001
will tiny nudges to the system result in a state that tends back towards that 

304
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,590
fixed point, or away from it?

305
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,941
Physical intuition for the pendulum makes the answer here kind of obvious, 

306
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:23,531
but how would you think about stability just looking at the equations, 

307
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:27,070
say if they arose in some completely different less intuitive context?

308
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,444
We'll go over how to compute the answers to questions like this in following videos, 

309
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:36,063
and the intuition for the relevant computations are guided heavily by 

310
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:39,734
the thought of looking at small regions in space around a fixed point, 

311
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,630
and asking whether the flow tends to contract or expand.

312
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,730
And speaking of attraction and stability, let's take a brief side-step to talk about love.

313
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,094
The Strogatz quote that I mentioned earlier comes from a whimsical column in 

314
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:56,932
the New York Times on the mathematics of modelling affection, 

315
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,320
an example well worth pilfering to illustrate that we're not just talking 

316
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,190
about physics here.

317
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,320
Imagine you've been flirting with someone, but there's been some frustrating 

318
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,768
inconsistency to how mutual your affection seems, 

319
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:11,342
and perhaps during a moment when you turn your attention towards physics 

320
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:14,818
to keep your mind off the romantic turmoil, mulling over the broken-up 

321
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:18,539
pendulum equations, you suddenly understand the on-again-off-again dynamics 

322
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,470
of your flirtation.

323
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,232
You've noticed that your own affection tends to increase when your 

324
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:28,770
companion seems interested in you, but decrease when they seem colder.

325
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,190
That is, the rate of change for your love is proportional to their feelings for you.

326
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,019
But this sweetheart of yours is precisely the opposite, 

327
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,172
strangely attracted to you when you seem uninterested, 

328
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:44,350
but turned off once you seem too keen.

329
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,804
The phase space for these equations looks very 

330
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,410
similar to the center part of your pendulum diagram.

331
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,990
The two of you will go back and forth between affection and repulsion in an endless cycle.

332
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,224
A metaphor of pendulum swings in your feelings would not just be apt, 

333
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:03,590
but mathematically verified.

334
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,400
In fact, if your partner's feelings were further slowed when they feel 

335
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,372
themselves too in love, let's say out of a fear of being made vulnerable, 

336
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,377
we'd have a term matching the friction in the pendulum, 

337
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:18,510
and you too would be destined to an inward spiral towards mutual ambivalence.

338
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,310
I hear wedding bells already.

339
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,869
The point is that two very different-seeming laws of dynamics, one from physics, 

340
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:30,484
involving a single variable, and another from, uh, chemistry, with two variables, 

341
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:35,381
actually have a very similar structure, easier to recognize when you're looking at the 

342
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,170
phase diagram.

343
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,737
Most notably, even though the equations are different, 

344
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:42,999
for example there's no sine function in the romance equations, 

345
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,210
the phase space exposes an underlying similarity nevertheless.

346
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,558
In other words, you're not just studying a pendulum right now, 

347
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,050
the tactics you develop to study one case have a tendency to transfer to many others.

348
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,854
Okay, so phase diagrams are a nice way to build understanding, 

349
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:04,150
but what about actually computing the answer to our equation?

350
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,062
One way to do this is to essentially simulate what the universe would do, 

351
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:13,710
but using finite time steps instead of the infinitesimals and limits defining calculus.

352
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,333
The basic idea is that if you're at some point in this phase diagram, 

353
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:22,850
take a step based on the vector you're sitting on for a small time step, delta t.

354
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,990
Specifically, take a step equal to delta t times that vector.

355
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,983
As a reminder, in drawing these vector fields, 

356
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:33,750
the magnitude for each vector has been artificially scaled down to prevent clutter.

357
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,536
When you do this repeatedly, your final location will be an approximation of theta t, 

358
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:43,350
where t is the sum of all those time steps.

359
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,900
If you think about what's being shown right now, though, 

360
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,380
and what that would imply for the pendulum's movement, 

361
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,770
you'd probably agree that this is grossly inaccurate.

362
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,710
But that's only because the time step delta t of 0.5 is way too big.

363
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,618
If we turned it down, say to 0.01, you can get a much more accurate approximation, 

364
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:05,290
it just takes more repeated steps is all.

365
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,570
In this case, computing theta of 10 requires 1000 little steps.

366
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,277
Luckily, we live in a world with computers, so repeating a simple task 1000 

367
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:19,050
times is as simple as articulating that task with a programming language.

368
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,271
In fact, let's finish things off by writing a little 

369
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:24,650
python program that computes theta of t for us.

370
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,650
What it has to do is make use of the differential equation, 

371
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,270
which returns the second derivative of theta as a function of theta and theta dot.

372
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,673
You start off by defining two variables, theta and theta dot, 

373
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:39,950
each in terms of some initial conditions.

374
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,581
In this case I'll have theta start at pi thirds, 

375
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:46,390
which is 60 degrees, and theta dot start at 0.

376
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,053
Next, write a loop that corresponds to taking many little time steps 

377
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:57,710
between 0 and time t, each of size delta t, which I'm setting here to be 0.01.

378
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,957
In each step of this loop, increase theta by theta dot times delta t, 

379
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:06,592
and increase theta dot by theta double dot times delta t, 

380
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:11,230
where theta double dot can be computed based on the differential equation.

381
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,650
After all these little time steps, simply return the value of theta.

382
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,410
This is called solving a differential equation numerically.

383
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,200
Numerical methods can get way more sophisticated and intricate than this to better 

384
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,650
balance the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, but this loop gives the basic idea.

385
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,825
So even though it sucks that we can't always find exact solutions, 

386
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,712
there are still meaningful ways to study differential equations in the face of 

387
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:38,450
this inability.

388
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,958
In the following videos, we'll look at several methods for finding exact 

389
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:47,412
solutions when it's possible, but one theme I'd like to focus on is how these 

390
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:51,810
exact solutions can also help us to study the more general, unsolvable cases.

391
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,050
But it gets worse.

392
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,368
Just as there's a limit to how far exact analytic solutions can get us, 

393
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:02,199
one of the great fields to have emerged in the last century, chaos theory, 

394
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:06,439
has exposed that there are further limits on how well we can use these systems for 

395
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,330
prediction with or without solutions.

396
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,405
Specifically, we know that for some systems, small variations to the initial conditions, 

397
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,674
say the kind due to necessarily imperfect measurements, 

398
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:20,010
result in wildly different trajectories.

399
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,270
We've even built some good understanding for why this happens.

400
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,270
The three-body problem, for example, is known to have seeds of chaos within it.

401
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,460
So looking back at the quote from earlier, it seems almost cruel of the 

402
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,001
universe to fill its language with riddles that we either can't solve, 

403
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:40,190
or where we know that any solution would be useless for long-term prediction anyway.

404
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,350
It is cruel, but then again it should also be reassuring.

405
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,032
It gives some hope that the complexity we see in the world around us can be studied 

406
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:53,246
somewhere in this math, and that it's not hidden away in the mismatch between model and 

407
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:53,630
reality.
