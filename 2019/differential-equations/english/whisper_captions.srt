00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,820
Taking a quote from Stephen Strogatz, since Newton, mankind has come to realize that the

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,460
laws of physics are always expressed in the language of differential equations.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,240
Of course, this language is spoken well beyond the boundaries of physics as well, and being

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,480
able to speak it and read it adds a new color to how you view the world around you.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,400
In the next few videos, I want to give a sort of tour of this topic.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
The aim is to give a big picture view of what this piece of math is all about, while at

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,960
the same time being happy to dig into the details of specific examples as they come

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,380
along.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,680
I'll be assuming you know the basics of calculus, like what derivatives and integrals

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,100
are, and in later videos we'll need some basic linear algebra, but not too much beyond

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,820
that.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,440
Differential equations arise whenever it's easier to describe change than absolute amounts.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,920
It's easier to say why population sizes, for example, grow or shrink than it is to

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,680
describe why they have the particular values they do at some point in time.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,520
It may be easier to describe why your love for someone is changing than why it happens

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,680
to be where it is now.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,100
In physics, more specifically Newtonian mechanics, motion is often described in terms of force,

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,500
and force determines acceleration, which is a statement about change.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,400
These equations come in two different flavors, ordinary differential equations, or ODEs,

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,680
involving functions with a single input, often thought of as time, and partial differential

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,060
equations, or PDEs, dealing with functions that have multiple inputs.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,080
Partial differential equations are something we'll be looking at more closely in the

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,600
next video.

24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,160
You often think of them as involving a whole continuum of values changing with time, like

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,940
the temperature at every point of a solid body, or the velocity of a fluid at every

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,800
point in space.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,200
Ordinary differential equations, our focus for now, involve only a finite collection

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,820
of values changing with time.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,360
And it doesn't have to be time per se, your one independent variable could be something

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,380
else, but things changing with time are the prototypical and most common example of differential

31
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,020
equations.

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,740
Physics offers a nice playground for us here, with simple examples to start with, and no

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,500
shortage of intricacy and nuance as we delve deeper.

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,360
As a nice warmup, consider the trajectory of something you throw in the air.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,520
The force of gravity near the surface of Earth causes things to accelerate downward at 9.8

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,500
meters per second per second.

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,060
Now unpack what that's really saying.

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:37,640
It means if you look at that object free from other forces, and record its velocity at every

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,580
small downward component of 9.8 meters per second every second, we call this constant

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,000
9.8 g for gravity.

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,000
This is enough to give us an example of a differential equation, albeit a relatively

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,780
simple one.

43
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,120
Focus on the y-coordinate as a function of time.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,260
Its derivative gives the vertical component of velocity, whose derivative in turn gives

45
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,180
the vertical component of acceleration.

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,420
For compactness, let's write the first derivative as y-dot and the second derivative as y-double-dot.

47
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,320
Our equation says that y-double-dot is equal to negative g, a simple constant.

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,580
This is one we can solve by integrating, which is essentially working the question backwards.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,340
First, to find velocity, you ask, what function has negative g as a derivative?

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,720
Well, it's negative g times t, or more specifically, negative gt plus the initial velocity.

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,740
Notice that there are many functions with this particular derivative, so you have an

52
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,260
extra degree of freedom which is determined by an initial condition.

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,860
Now what function has this as a derivative?

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
It turns out to be negative one-half g times t squared plus that initial velocity times

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,400
t, and again we're free to add an additional constant without changing the derivative,

56
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,680
and that constant is determined by whatever the initial position is.

57
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,820
And there you go, we just solved a differential equation, figuring out what a function is

58
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,360
based on information about its rate of change.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,160
Things get more interesting when the forces acting on a body depend on where that body

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,700
is.

61
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,010
For example, studying the motion of planets, stars, and moons, gravity can no longer be

62
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,830
considered a constant.

63
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,990
Given two bodies, the pole on one of them is in the direction of the other, with a strength

64
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,810
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,870
As always, the rate of change of position is velocity, but now the rate of change of

66
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,350
velocity, acceleration, is some function of position, so you have this dance between two

67
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,750
mutually interacting variables, reminiscent of the dance between the two moving bodies

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,730
which they describe.

69
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,490
This is reflective of the fact that often in differential equations, the puzzles you

70
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,830
face involve finding a function whose derivative and or higher order derivatives are defined

71
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,690
in terms of the function itself.

72
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,690
In physics it's most common to work with second order differential equations, which

73
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,090
means the highest derivative you find in this expression is a second derivative.

74
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,970
Higher order differential equations would be ones involving third derivatives, fourth

75
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,810
derivatives, and so on, puzzles with more intricate clues.

76
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,870
The sensation you get when really meditating on one of these equations is one of solving

77
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,150
an infinite continuous jigsaw puzzle.

78
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,610
In a sense, you have to find infinitely many numbers, one for each point in time t, but

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,190
they're constrained by a very specific way that these values intertwine with their own

80
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,850
rate of change, and the rate of change of that rate of change.

81
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,070
To get a feel for what studying these can look like, I want you to take some time digging

82
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,310
into a deceptively simple example, a pendulum.

83
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,110
How does this angle theta that it makes with the vertical change as a function of time?

84
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,170
This is often given as an example in introductory physics classes of harmonic motion, meaning

85
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,770
it oscillates like a sine wave.

86
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,270
More specifically, one with a period of 2 pi times the square root of l over g, where

87
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,170
l is the length of the pendulum and g is the strength of gravity.

88
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,110
However, these formulas are actually lies, or rather, approximations which only work

89
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,450
in the realm of small angles.

90
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,410
If you were to go and measure an actual pendulum, what you'd find is that as you pull it out

91
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,910
farther, the period is longer than what the high school physics formulas would suggest.

92
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,750
And when you pull it out really far, this value of theta plotted versus time doesn't

93
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,650
even look like a sine wave anymore.

94
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,690
To understand what's really going on, first things first, let's set up the differential

95
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,190
equation.

96
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,170
We'll measure the position of the pendulum's weight as a distance x along this arc, and

97
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,630
if the angle theta we care about is measured in radians, we can write x as l times theta,

98
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,550
where l is the length of the pendulum.

99
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,550
As usual, gravity pulls down with an acceleration of g, but because the pendulum constrains

100
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,530
the motion of this mass, we have to look at the component of this acceleration in the

101
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,430
direction of motion.

102
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,710
A little geometry exercise for you is to show that this little angle here is the same as

103
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,270
theta.

104
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:41,090
So the component of gravity in the direction of motion opposite this angle will be

105
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,470
negative g times sine of theta.

106
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,370
Here we're considering theta to be positive when the pendulum is swung to the right, and

107
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,090
negative when it's swung to the left.

108
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,450
This minus sign in the acceleration indicates that it's always pointed in the opposite

109
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,090
direction from displacement.

110
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,890
So what we have is that the second derivative of x, the acceleration, is negative g times

111
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,650
sine of theta.

112
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,510
As always, it's nice to do a quick gut check that our formula makes physical sense.

113
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,350
When theta is zero, sine of zero is zero, so there's no acceleration in the direction

114
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,850
of movement.

115
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,750
When theta is 90 degrees, sine of theta is 1, so the acceleration is the same as it would

116
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,650
be for freefall.

117
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
Alright, that checks out.

118
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,690
And because x is L times theta, that means the second derivative of theta is negative

119
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,550
g over L times sine of theta.

120
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,370
To be a little more realistic, let's add in a term to account for the air resistance,

121
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,470
which maybe we model as being proportional to the velocity.

122
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,570
We'll write this as negative mu times theta dot, where mu is some constant that encapsulates

123
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,770
all the air resistance and friction and such that determines how quickly the pendulum loses

124
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,330
energy.

125
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,810
Now this, my friends, is a particularly juicy differential equation.

126
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,630
It's not easy to solve, but it's not so hard that we can't reasonably get some meaningful

127
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,770
understanding out of it.

128
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,190
At first glance, you might think that the sine function you see here relates to the

129
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,650
sine wave pattern for the pendulum.

130
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,790
Ironically, though, what you'll eventually find is that the opposite is true.

131
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,750
The presence of the sine in this equation is precisely why real pendulums don't oscillate

132
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,810
with a sine wave pattern.

133
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,310
If that sounds odd, consider the fact that here, the sine function is taking theta as

134
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,350
an input, but in the approximate solution you might see in a physics class, theta itself

135
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,150
is oscillating as the output of a sine function.

136
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,550
Clearly something fishy is afoot.

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,650
One thing I like about this example is that, even though it's comparatively simple, it

138
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,630
exposes an important truth about differential equations that you need to grapple with.

139
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,750
They're really freaking hard to solve.

140
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,730
In this case, if we remove that dampening term, we can just barely write down an analytic

141
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,430
solution, but it's hilariously complicated.

142
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,650
It involves all these functions you've probably never heard of, written in terms of integrals

143
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,910
and weird inverse integral problems.

144
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,110
When you step back, presumably the reason for finding a solution is to then be able

145
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,350
to make computations and build an understanding for whatever dynamics you're studying.

146
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,690
In this case, those questions have been punted off to figuring out how to compute, and more

147
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,170
importantly, understand, these new functions.

148
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,210
And more often, like if we add back in that dampening term, there's not a known way

149
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,650
to write down an exact analytic solution.

150
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,630
Well, for any hard problem you could just define a new function to be the answer of

151
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,510
that problem, heck, even name it after yourself if you want, but again, that's pointless

152
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,370
unless it leads you to being able to make computations and build understanding.

153
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,670
So instead, in the study of differential equations, we often do a sort of short circuit, and skip

154
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,290
the actual solution part, since it's unattainable, and go straight to building understanding

155
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,350
and making computations from the equations alone.

156
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,310
Let me walk through what that might look like with a pendulum.

157
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,250
What do you hold in your head, or what visualization can you get some software to pull up for you,

158
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,490
to understand the many possible ways that a pendulum, governed by these laws, might

159
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,810
evolve depending on its starting conditions?

160
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,570
You might be tempted to try imagining the graph of theta vs. t, and somehow interpreting

161
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,730
how this slope, position, and curvature all interrelate with each other.

162
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,650
However, what will turn out to be both easier and more general is to start by visualizing

163
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,590
all possible states in a two-dimensional plane.

164
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,790
What I mean by the state of the pendulum is that you can describe it with two numbers,

165
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,390
the angle and the angular velocity.

166
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,170
You can freely change either one of those two values without necessarily changing the

167
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,230
other, but the acceleration is purely a function of those two values.

168
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,570
So each point of this two-dimensional plane fully describes the pendulum at any given moment.

169
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,330
You might think of these as all possible initial conditions of that pendulum.

170
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,550
If you know the initial angle and the angular velocity, that's enough to predict how the

171
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,930
system will evolve as time moves forward.

172
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,770
If you haven't worked with them before, these sorts of diagrams can take a little

173
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,550
getting used to.

174
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,450
What you're looking at now, this inward spiral, is a fairly typical trajectory for

175
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,930
our pendulum, so take a moment to think carefully about what is being represented.

176
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,250
Notice how at the start, as theta decreases, theta dot, the y-coordinate, gets more negative.

177
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,170
Which makes sense, because the pendulum moves faster in the leftward direction as it approaches

178
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,710
the bottom.

179
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,230
Keep in mind, even though the velocity vector on this pendulum is pointed to the left, the

180
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,830
value of that velocity is always being represented by the vertical component of our space.

181
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,830
It's important to remind yourself that this state space is an abstract thing, and is distinct

182
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,850
from the physical space where the pendulum itself moves.

183
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,490
Since we're modeling this as losing some of its energy to air resistance, this trajectory

184
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,230
spirals inward, meaning the peak velocity and peak displacement each go down a bit with

185
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,790
each swing.

186
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,170
Our point is, in a sense, attracted to the origin, where theta and theta dot both equal

187
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,610
0.

188
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,910
With this space, we can visualize a differential equation as a vector field.

189
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,630
Here, let me show you what I mean.

190
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,030
The pendulum state is a vector, theta, theta dot.

191
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,310
Maybe you think of that as an arrow from the origin, or maybe you think of it as a point.

192
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,670
What matters is that it has two coordinates, each a function of time.

193
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,010
Taking the derivative of that vector gives you its rate of change, the direction and

194
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,730
speed that it will tend to move in this diagram.

195
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,550
That derivative is a new vector, theta dot theta double dot, which we visualize as being

196
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,970
attached to the relevant point in space.

197
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,670
Take a moment to interpret what this is saying.

198
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,450
The first component for this rate of change vector is theta dot, which is also a coordinate

199
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,230
in our space.

200
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,450
The higher up we are in the diagram, the more the point tends to move to the right, and

201
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,470
the lower we are, the more it tends to move to the left.

202
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,090
The vertical component is theta double dot, which our differential equation lets us rewrite

203
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,350
entirely in terms of theta and theta dot itself.

204
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,810
In other words, the first derivative of our state vector is some function of that vector

205
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,290
itself, with most of the intricacy tied up in that second coordinate.

206
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,570
Doing the same at all points of this space will show how that state tends to change from

207
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,270
any position.

208
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,370
As is typical with vector fields, we artificially scale down the vectors when we draw them to

209
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,650
prevent clutter, but use color to loosely indicate magnitude.

210
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,410
Notice we've effectively broken up a single second-order equation into a system of two

211
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,530
first-order equations.

212
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,110
You might even give theta dot a different name, to emphasize that we're really thinking

213
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,290
of two separate values, intertwined via this mutual effect they have on one another's

214
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,050
rate of change.

215
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,390
This is a common trick in the study of differential equations.

216
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,570
Instead of thinking about higher order changes of a single value, we often prefer to think

217
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,110
of the first derivative of vector values.

218
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,770
In this form, we have a wonderful visual way to think about what solving the equation means.

219
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:37,410
As our system evolves from some initial state, our point in this space will move along some

220
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:43,150
trajectory in such a way that at every moment, the velocity of that point matches the vector

221
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,130
from this field.

222
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,230
And again, keep in mind, this velocity is not the same thing as the physical velocity

223
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,290
of the pendulum, it's a more abstract rate of change, encoding the rates of change for

224
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,130
both theta and theta dot.

225
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,090
You might find it fun to pause for a moment and think through what exactly some of these

226
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,790
trajectory lines say about the possible ways the pendulum evolves from different starting

227
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,390
conditions.

228
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,830
For example, in regions where theta dot is quite high, the vectors guide the point to

229
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,850
travel to the right quite a ways before settling down into an inward spiral.

230
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,390
This corresponds to a pendulum with a high enough initial velocity that it fully rotates

231
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,490
around several times before settling into a decaying back and forth.

232
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,770
Having a little more fun?

233
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,670
When I tweak this air resistance term, mu, say increasing it, you can immediately see

234
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,890
how this will result in trajectories that spiral inward faster, which is to say the

235
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,590
pendulum slows down faster.

236
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,470
That's obvious when I call it the air resistance term, but imagine you saw these equations

237
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,490
out of context, not knowing they described a pendulum.

238
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,410
It's not obvious just looking at them that increasing this value of mu means the system

239
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,590
as a whole tends towards some attracting state faster.

240
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,370
So getting some software to draw these vector fields for you can be a great way to build

241
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,090
an intuition for how they behave.

242
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:15,010
What's wonderful is that any system of ordinary differential equations can be described by

243
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,870
a vector field like this, so it's a very general way to get a feel for them.

244
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,090
Usually, though, they have many more dimensions.

245
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,470
For example, consider the famous three-body problem, which is to predict how three masses

246
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,350
in three-dimensional space evolve if they act on each other with gravity, and if you

247
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,470
know their initial positions and velocities.

248
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,150
Each mass has three coordinates describing its position, and three more describing its

249
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,570
momentum.

250
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,770
So the system has 18 degrees of freedom in total, and hence an 18-dimensional space of

251
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,690
possible states.

252
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,970
It's a bizarre thought, isn't it?

253
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,010
A single point meandering through an 18-dimensional space that we cannot visualize, obediently

254
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,450
taking steps through time based on whatever vector it happens to be sitting on from moment

255
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,290
to moment, completely encoding the positions and the momenta of the three masses we see

256
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,470
in ordinary, physical 3D space.

257
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,470
In practice, you can reduce the number of dimensions here by taking advantage of the

258
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,670
symmetries of your setup, but the point that more degrees of freedom results in higher

259
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,730
dimensional state spaces remains the same.

260
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,530
In math, we often call a space like this a phase space.

261
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,470
You'll hear me use that term broadly for spaces encoding all kinds of states of changing

262
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,370
systems, but you should know that in the context of physics, especially Hamiltonian mechanics,

263
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,850
the term is often reserved for a more special case, namely a space whose axes represent

264
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,110
position and momentum.

265
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,650
So a physicist would agree that the 18-dimensional space describing the three-body problem is

266
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,330
a phase space, but they might ask that we make a couple of modifications to our pendulum

267
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,370
setup for it to properly deserve the term.

268
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,810
For those of you who just watched the block collision video, the planes we worked with

269
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,670
there would be called phase spaces by math folk, though a physicist might prefer other

270
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,250
terminology.

271
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,830
Just know that the specific meaning may depend on your context.

272
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,410
It may seem like a simple idea, depending on how well indoctrinated you are to modern

273
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,650
ways of thinking about math, but it's worth keeping in mind that it took humanity quite

274
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:22,190
a while to really embrace thinking of dynamics spatially like this, especially when the dimensions

275
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,190
get very large.

276
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,150
In his book Chaos, the author James Glick describes phase space as,

277
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:52,030
To take one example of why phase flow is a fruitful idea, consider the question of stability.

278
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:58,030
The origin of our space corresponds to the pendulum standing still, and so does this

279
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,910
point over here, representing when the pendulum is perfectly balanced upright.

280
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,430
These are the so-called fixed points of our system, and one natural question to ask is

281
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,070
whether or not they're stable, that is, will tiny nudges to the system result in a

282
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,590
state that tends back towards that fixed point, or away from it?

283
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,250
Physical intuition for the pendulum makes the answer here kind of obvious, but how would

284
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,310
you think about stability just looking at the equations, say if they arose in some completely

285
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,070
different less intuitive context?

286
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,730
We'll go over how to compute the answers to questions like this in following videos,

287
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,370
and the intuition for the relevant computations are guided heavily by the thought of looking

288
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,690
at small regions in space around a fixed point, and asking whether the flow tends to contract

289
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,630
or expand.

290
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,430
And speaking of attraction and stability, let's take a brief side-step to talk about

291
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,730
love.

292
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,150
The Strogatz quote that I mentioned earlier comes from a whimsical column in the New York

293
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,110
Times on the mathematics of modelling affection, an example well worth pilfering to illustrate

294
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,190
that we're not just talking about physics here.

295
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,630
Imagine you've been flirting with someone, but there's been some frustrating inconsistency

296
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,430
to how mutual your affection seems, and perhaps during a moment when you turn your attention

297
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,650
towards physics to keep your mind off the romantic turmoil, mulling over the broken-up

298
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,470
pendulum equations, you suddenly understand the on-again-off-again dynamics of your flirtation.

299
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,410
You've noticed that your own affection tends to increase when your companion seems interested

300
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,770
in you, but decrease when they seem colder.

301
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,190
That is, the rate of change for your love is proportional to their feelings for you.

302
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,910
But this sweetheart of yours is precisely the opposite, strangely attracted to you when

303
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,350
you seem uninterested, but turned off once you seem too keen.

304
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,910
The phase space for these equations looks very similar to the center part of your pendulum

305
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,410
diagram.

306
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,990
The two of you will go back and forth between affection and repulsion in an endless cycle.

307
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,050
A metaphor of pendulum swings in your feelings would not just be apt, but mathematically

308
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,590
verified.

309
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,550
In fact, if your partner's feelings were further slowed when they feel themselves too

310
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,890
in love, let's say out of a fear of being made vulnerable, we'd have a term matching

311
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,410
the friction in the pendulum, and you too would be destined to an inward spiral towards

312
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,510
mutual ambivalence.

313
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,310
I hear wedding bells already.

314
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,830
The point is that two very different-seeming laws of dynamics, one from physics, involving

315
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:32,210
a single variable, and another from, uh, chemistry, with two variables, actually have a very similar

316
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,170
structure, easier to recognize when you're looking at the phase diagram.

317
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,450
Most notably, even though the equations are different, for example there's no sine function

318
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,210
in the romance equations, the phase space exposes an underlying similarity nevertheless.

319
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,310
In other words, you're not just studying a pendulum right now, the tactics you develop

320
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,050
to study one case have a tendency to transfer to many others.

321
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,250
Okay, so phase diagrams are a nice way to build understanding, but what about actually

322
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,150
computing the answer to our equation?

323
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:10,230
One way to do this is to essentially simulate what the universe would do, but using finite

324
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,710
time steps instead of the infinitesimals and limits defining calculus.

325
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,290
The basic idea is that if you're at some point in this phase diagram, take a step based

326
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,850
on the vector you're sitting on for a small time step, delta t.

327
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,990
Specifically, take a step equal to delta t times that vector.

328
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,310
As a reminder, in drawing these vector fields, the magnitude for each vector has been artificially

329
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,750
scaled down to prevent clutter.

330
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,990
When you do this repeatedly, your final location will be an approximation of theta t, where

331
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,350
t is the sum of all those time steps.

332
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,930
If you think about what's being shown right now, though, and what that would imply for

333
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,770
the pendulum's movement, you'd probably agree that this is grossly inaccurate.

334
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,710
But that's only because the time step delta t of 0.5 is way too big.

335
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,550
If we turned it down, say to 0.01, you can get a much more accurate approximation, it

336
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,290
just takes more repeated steps is all.

337
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,570
In this case, computing theta of 10 requires 1000 little steps.

338
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,110
Luckily, we live in a world with computers, so repeating a simple task 1000 times is as

339
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,050
simple as articulating that task with a programming language.

340
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,750
In fact, let's finish things off by writing a little python program that computes theta

341
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,650
of t for us.

342
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,030
What it has to do is make use of the differential equation, which returns the second derivative

343
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,270
of theta as a function of theta and theta dot.

344
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,410
You start off by defining two variables, theta and theta dot, each in terms of some initial

345
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:39,950
conditions.

346
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,550
In this case I'll have theta start at pi thirds, which is 60 degrees, and theta dot

347
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,390
start at 0.

348
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,350
Next, write a loop that corresponds to taking many little time steps between 0 and time

349
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,710
t, each of size delta t, which I'm setting here to be 0.01.

350
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:04,710
In each step of this loop, increase theta by theta dot times delta t, and increase theta

351
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,110
dot by theta double dot times delta t, where theta double dot can be computed based on

352
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,230
the differential equation.

353
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,650
After all these little time steps, simply return the value of theta.

354
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,410
This is called solving a differential equation numerically.

355
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,970
Numerical methods can get way more sophisticated and intricate than this to better balance

356
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,650
the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, but this loop gives the basic idea.

357
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,010
So even though it sucks that we can't always find exact solutions, there are still meaningful

358
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,450
ways to study differential equations in the face of this inability.

359
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,490
In the following videos, we'll look at several methods for finding exact solutions when it's

360
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,950
possible, but one theme I'd like to focus on is how these exact solutions can also help

361
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,810
us to study the more general, unsolvable cases.

362
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,050
But it gets worse.

363
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,110
Just as there's a limit to how far exact analytic solutions can get us, one of the

364
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,990
great fields to have emerged in the last century, chaos theory, has exposed that there are further

365
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,330
limits on how well we can use these systems for prediction with or without solutions.

366
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,050
Specifically, we know that for some systems, small variations to the initial conditions,

367
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,010
say the kind due to necessarily imperfect measurements, result in wildly different trajectories.

368
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,270
We've even built some good understanding for why this happens.

369
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,270
The three-body problem, for example, is known to have seeds of chaos within it.

370
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,670
So looking back at the quote from earlier, it seems almost cruel of the universe to fill

371
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,910
its language with riddles that we either can't solve, or where we know that any solution

372
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,190
would be useless for long-term prediction anyway.

373
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,350
It is cruel, but then again it should also be reassuring.

374
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,010
It gives some hope that the complexity we see in the world around us can be studied

375
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,310
somewhere in this math, and that it's not hidden away in the mismatch between model

376
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,110
and reality.
