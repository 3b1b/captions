1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,200
After seeing how we think about ordinary differential equations in chapter 1, we turn now to an

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,520
example of a partial differential equation, the heat equation.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,380
To set things up, imagine you have some object, like a piece of metal, and you know how the

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,160
heat is distributed across it at any one moment, that is, what's the temperature of every

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,880
individual point along this plate.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,500
The question is, how will this distribution change over time, as the heat flows from warmer

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,920
spots to cooler ones?

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,000
The image on the left shows the temperature of an example plate using color, with the

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,340
graph of that temperature being shown on the right.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,940
To take a concrete one-dimensional example, let's say you have two different rods at

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,580
different temperatures, where that temperature is uniform along each one.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,940
You know that when you bring them into contact, the temperature will flow from the hot one

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,220
to the cool one, tending to make the whole thing equal over time.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,160
But how exactly?

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,040
What will the temperature distribution be at each point in time?

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,460
As is typical with differential equations, the idea is that it's easier to describe

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,980
how this setup changes from moment to moment than it is to jump straight to a description

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,140
of the full evolution.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,080
We write this rule of change in the language of derivatives, though as you'll see, we'll

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,580
need to expand our vocabulary a bit beyond ordinary derivatives.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,100
And don't worry, we'll learn how to read the equations you're seeing now in just

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,480
a minute.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,660
Variations of the heat equation show up in many other parts of math and physics, like

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,080
Brownian motion, the black-Scholes equations from finance, and all sorts of diffusion,

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,340
so there are many dividends to be had from a deep understanding of this one setup.

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,320
In the last video we looked at ways of building understanding while acknowledging the truth

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,120
that most differential equations are simply too difficult to actually solve.

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,260
And indeed, PDEs tend to be even harder than ODEs, largely because they involve modeling

29
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,620
infinitely many values changing in concert.

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,920
But our main character for today is an equation we can actually solve.

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,560
In fact, if you've ever heard of Fourier series, you may be interested to know that

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,260
this is the physical problem which Babyface Fourier over here was trying to solve when

33
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,740
he stumbled across the corner of math that is now so replete with his name.

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,060
We'll dig into Fourier series much more deeply in the next chapter, but I would like

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,300
to give you at least a little hint of the beautiful connection which is to come.

36
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,420
This animation you're seeing right now shows how lots of little rotating vectors, each

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,700
rotating at some constant integer frequency, can trace out an arbitrary shape.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,260
To be clear, what's happening is that these vectors are being added together, tip to tail,

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,160
at each moment, and you might imagine that the last one has some sort of pencil at its

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,100
tip, tracing a path as it goes.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,240
For finitely many vectors, this tracing usually won't be a perfect replica of the target

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,200
shape, which in this animation is a lowercase f, but the more circles you include, the closer

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,760
it gets.

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,660
What you're seeing now uses only 100 circles, and I think you'd agree that the deviations

45
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,340
from the real shape are negligible.

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,840
What's mind-blowing is that just by tweaking the initial size and angle of each vector,

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,500
that gives you enough control to approximate any curve you want.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,160
At first, this might seem like an idle curiosity, a neat art project, but little more.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,600
In fact, the math that makes this possible is the same as the math describing the physics

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,340
of heat flow.

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,620
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,700
Step one is simply to build up the heat equation, and for that, let's start by being clear

53
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,820
about what the function we're analyzing is exactly.

54
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,500
We have a rod in one dimension, and we're thinking of it as sitting on an x-axis, so

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,120
each point of that rod is labeled with a unique number, x.

56
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,480
The temperature is some function of that position, t of x, shown here as a graph above it.

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,780
But really, since the value changes over time, we should think of this function as having

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,800
one more input, t, for time.

59
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,100
You could, if you wanted, think of this input space as being two-dimensional, representing

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,160
space and time together, with the temperature being graphed as a surface above it, each

61
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,900
slice across time, showing you what that distribution looks like at any given moment.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,120
Or you could simply think of this graph of temperature changing with time.

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,420
Both are equivalent.

64
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,720
This surface is not to be confused with what I was showing earlier, the temperature graph

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
of a two-dimensional body.

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Be mindful when you're studying equations like these of whether time is being represented

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,660
with its own axis, or if it's being represented with literal changes over time, say in an

68
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,060
animation.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,240
Last chapter, we looked at some systems where just a handful of numbers changed over time,

70
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,600
like the angle and angular velocity of a pendulum, describing that change in the language of

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,120
derivatives.

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,340
But when we have an entire function changing with time, the mathematical tools become slightly

73
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,100
more intricate.

74
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,460
Because we're thinking of this temperature function with multiple dimensions to its input

75
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,500
space, in this case one for space and one for time, there are multiple different rates

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,560
of change at play.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,380
There's the derivative with respect to x, how rapidly the temperature changes as you

78
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,500
move along the rod.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,580
You might think of this as the slope of our surface when you slice it parallel to the

80
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,860
x-axis, or given a tiny step in the x-direction and the tiny change to temperature caused

81
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,360
by it, giving a ratio between the two.

82
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,000
But there's also the rate at which a single point on the rod changes with time, what you

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,440
might think of as the slope of the surface when you slice it in the other direction,

84
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,960
parallel to the time axis.

85
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,440
Each one of these derivatives tells only part of the story for how this temperature function

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,960
changes, so we call them partial derivatives.

87
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,200
To emphasize this point, the notation changes a little, replacing the letter D with a special

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,280
curly D, sometimes called del.

89
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,820
Personally, I think it's a little silly to change the notation for this since it's

90
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,120
essentially the same operation.

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,220
I would rather see notation that emphasizes that the delT terms up in the numerators refer

92
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,000
to different changes, one is a small change to temperature after a small change in time,

93
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,300
the other is a small change to temperature after a small step in space.

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,500
To reiterate a point I made in the calculus series, I do think it's healthy to initially

95
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,800
read derivatives like this as a literal ratio between a small change to the function's

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,980
output and the small change to the input that caused it.

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Just keep in mind that what this notation is meant to encode is the limit of that ratio

98
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,860
for smaller and smaller nudges to the input, rather than a specific value of the ratio

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,380
for a finitely small nudge.

100
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,440
This goes for partial derivatives just as much as it does for ordinary derivatives.

101
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,580
The heat equation is written in terms of these partial derivatives.

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,020
It tells us that the way this function changes with respect to time depends on how it changes

103
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,180
with respect to space.

104
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,160
More specifically, it's proportional to the second partial derivative with respect

105
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,720
to x.

106
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,960
At a high level, the intuition is that at points where the temperature distribution

107
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
curves, it tends to change more quickly in the direction of that curvature.

108
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,800
Since a rule like this is written using partial derivatives, we call it a partial differential

109
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,300
equation.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,600
This has the funny result that to an outsider, the name sounds like a tamer version of ordinary

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,740
differential equations, when quite to the contrary, partial differential equations tend

112
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,700
to tell a much richer story than ODEs, and are much harder to solve in general.

113
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,560
The general heat equation applies to bodies in any number of dimensions, which would mean

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,660
more inputs to our temperature function, but it'll be easiest for us to stay focused

115
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,560
on the one-dimensional case of a rod.

116
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,580
As it is, graphing this in a way which gives time its own axis already pushes our visuals

117
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,740
into the third dimension.

118
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
So I threw out this equation, but where does this come from?

119
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,580
How could you think up something like this yourself?

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,560
Well, for that let's simplify things by describing a discrete version of the setup,

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,800
where you have only finitely many points x in a row.

122
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,040
This is sort of like working in a pixelated universe where instead of having a continuum

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,300
of temperatures, we have a finite set of separate values.

124
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
The intuition here is simple.

125
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,520
For a particular point, if its two neighbors on either side are on average hotter than

126
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,260
it is, it will heat up.

127
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,660
If they're cooler on average, it'll cool down.

128
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,780
Here, specifically focus on these three neighboring points x1, x2, and x3, with corresponding

129
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,260
temperatures T1, T2, and T3.

130
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,660
What we want to compare is the average of T1 and T3 with the value of T2.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,180
When this difference is greater than zero, T2 will tend to heat up.

132
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,460
And the bigger the difference, the faster it heats up.

133
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,780
Likewise, if it's negative, T2 will tend to cool down, at a rate proportional to that

134
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,240
difference.

135
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,220
More formally, we write that the derivative of T2 with respect to time is proportional

136
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,100
to the difference between its neighbors and its own value.

137
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,380
Alpha here is simply a proportionality constant.

138
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,800
To write this in a way which will ultimately explain the second derivative in the heat

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,180
equation, let me rearrange this right hand a bit in terms of the difference between T1

140
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,420
and T2, and the difference between T2 and T3.

141
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,000
You can quickly check that these two are the same.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,240
The top has half of T1, and in the bottom there are two minus signs in front of T1,

143
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,320
so it's positive, and the half has been factored out.

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Likewise, both have half of T3.

145
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,660
Then on the bottom we have a negative T2 that's effectively written twice, so when you take

146
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,300
half of that it's the same as the single negative T2 written up top.

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,460
Like I said, the reason to rewrite it is that it takes us a step closer to the language

148
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,200
of derivatives.

149
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,500
In fact, let's write these as delta T1 and delta T2.

150
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,880
It's the same value on the right hand side, but we're adding a new perspective to how

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,620
to think about it.

152
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,200
Instead of comparing the average of the neighbors to T2, we're thinking about the difference

153
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,380
of the differences.

154
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,400
Here, take a moment to gut check that this makes sense.

155
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,440
If those two differences are the same, then the average of T1 and T3 is the same as T2,

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,700
so T2 will not tend to change.

157
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,660
If delta T2 is bigger than delta T1, meaning the difference of the differences is positive,

158
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,120
notice how the average of T1 and T3 is bigger than T2, so T2 tends to increase.

159
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,520
And on the flip side, if the difference of the differences is negative, which means delta

160
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,140
T2 is smaller than delta T1, it corresponds to an average of these neighbors being less

161
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,100
than T2.

162
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,040
We could be especially compact with our notation and write this whole term, the difference

163
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,020
between the differences, as delta delta T1.

164
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,280
This is known in the lingo as a second difference.

165
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,320
If it feels a little weird to think about, keep in mind, it's essentially a compact

166
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,120
way of writing the idea of how much T2 differs from the average of its neighbors.

167
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,960
It just has this extra factor of one half, is all.

168
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,900
And that factor doesn't really matter, because either way we're writing this equation in

169
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,520
terms of some proportionality constant.

170
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,040
The upshot is that the rate of change for the temperature of a point is proportional

171
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,260
to the second difference around it.

172
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,640
As we go from this finite context to the infinite continuous case, the analog of a second difference

173
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,020
is the second derivative.

174
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,180
Instead of looking at the difference between the temperature values at points some fixed

175
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,920
distance apart, you instead consider what happens as you shrink the size of that step

176
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,820
towards zero.

177
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,620
And in calculus, instead of talking about absolute differences, which would also approach

178
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,260
zero, you think in terms of the rate of change.

179
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,420
In this case, what's the rate of change in temperature per unit distance?

180
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,540
And remember, there are two separate rates of change at play.

181
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,140
How does that temperature change as time progresses, and how does the temperature change as you

182
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,200
move along the rod?

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
The core intuition remains the same as what we had in the discrete case.

184
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,320
To know how a point differs from its neighbors, look not just at how the function changes

185
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,260
from one point to the next, but at how the rate of change itself changes.

186
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,500
Now in calculus land, we write this as del-squared t over del x-squared, the second partial derivative

187
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,440
of our function with respect to x.

188
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,900
Notice how this slope increases at points where the graph curves upwards, meaning the

189
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,780
rate of change of the rate of change is positive.

190
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,800
Similarly, that slope decreases at points where the graph curves downwards, where the

191
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,460
rate of change of this rate of change is negative.

192
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,420
Tuck that away as a meaningful intuition for problems well beyond the heat equation.

193
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,320
Second derivatives give a measure of how a value compares to the average of its neighbors.

194
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,440
Hopefully that gives some satisfying added color to the equation.

195
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,780
It's already pretty intuitive when you read it as saying that curved points tend to flatten

196
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,640
out, but I think there's something even more satisfying about seeing a partial differential

197
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,780
equation like this arise almost mechanistically from thinking about each point as simply tending

198
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,280
towards the average of its neighbors.

199
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,080
Take a moment to compare what this feels like to the case of ordinary differential equations.

200
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,660
For example, if we have multiple bodies in space tugging at each other with gravity,

201
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,080
what we're analyzing is a handful of changing numbers, in this case the coordinates of each

202
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,500
object.

203
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,940
The rate of change for any one of these values depends on the values of the other numbers,

204
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,880
and we often write this down as a system of equations.

205
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,900
On the left, we have the derivative of each value with respect to time, and on the right

206
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,220
there's some combination of all the other values.

207
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,600
In our partial differential equation, the difference is that we have infinitely many

208
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,180
values changing from a continuum, and again, the way that any one of these values changes

209
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,300
depends on the other values, but quite helpfully, each one only depends on its immediate neighbors

210
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,740
in some limiting sense of the word neighbor.

211
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,000
So here, the relation on the right hand side is not a sum or product of the other numbers,

212
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,120
it's instead a kind of derivative, just a derivative with respect to space instead of

213
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,000
with respect to time.

214
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,980
In a sense, when you think about it, this one partial differential equation is like

215
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,240
a system of infinitely many equations, one for each point on the rod.

216
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,760
You might wonder about objects which are spread out in more than one dimension, like a plate,

217
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,940
or something three dimensional.

218
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,380
In that case the equation looks quite similar, but you include the second derivative with

219
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,260
respect to the other spatial directions as well.

220
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,480
And adding up all of these second spatial derivatives like this is common enough as

221
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,540
an operation that it has its own special name, the Laplacian, often written as this upside

222
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,680
down triangle squared.

223
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,340
It's essentially a multivariable version of the second derivative, and the intuition

224
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,220
for this equation is no different from the one dimensional case.

225
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,920
This Laplacian can still be thought of as measuring how different is a point from the

226
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,720
average of its neighbors, but now these neighbors aren't just left and right of it, they're

227
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,400
all around.

228
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,840
For the curious among you, I did a couple of videos during my time at Khan Academy on

229
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
this operator if you want to go check them out.

230
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,180
For those of you with multivariable calculus under your belt, it's nice to think about

231
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,020
as the divergence of the gradient.

232
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,240
But you don't have to worry about that, for our purposes let's stay focused on the

233
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,140
one dimensional case.

234
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,220
If you feel like you understand all of this, pat yourself on the back.

235
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,460
Being able to read a PDE is no joke, and it's a powerful addition to have to your vocabulary

236
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,360
for describing the world around you.

237
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,040
But after all of this time spent interpreting the equations, I say it's high time we start

238
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,120
solving them, don't you?

239
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,780
And trust me, there are few pieces of math quite as satisfying as what Poodlehaired Fourier

240
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,920
over here developed to solve this problem.

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,500
All this and more in the next chapter.

242
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,620
I was originally motivated to cover this particular topic when I got an early view

243
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,920
of Steve Strogatz's new book Infinite Powers.

244
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,500
This isn't a sponsored message or anything like that, but all cards on the table I do

245
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,260
have two selfish ulterior motives for mentioning it.

246
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,680
The first is that Steve has been a really strong, maybe even pivotal, advocate for the

247
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,660
channel since the very beginning, and I've had an itch to repay that kindness for quite

248
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,080
a while.

249
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,400
And the second is to make more people love math, and calculus in particular.

250
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,000
That might not sound selfish, but think about it, when more people love math, the potential

251
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,900
audience base for these videos gets bigger.

252
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,140
And frankly there are few better ways to get people loving the subject than to expose them

253
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,140
to Strogatz's writing.

254
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,240
So if you have friends who you know who you think would enjoy the ideas of calculus but

255
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,400
maybe have been a bit intimidated by math in the past, this book does a really outstanding

256
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,440
job communicating the heart of the subject, both substantively and accessibly.

257
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,480
Its main theme is the idea of constructing solutions to complex real-world problems from

258
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,700
simple idealized building blocks, which as you'll see is exactly what Fourier did.

259
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,760
And for those of you who already know and love the subject, you will find no shortage

260
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,620
of fresh insights and enlightening stories.

261
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,060
I certainly enjoyed it.

262
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,280
Again, I kinda know that sounds like an ad, but it's not, I just actually think you'll

263
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,820
enjoy the book.
