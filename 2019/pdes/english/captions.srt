1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
After seeing how we think about ordinary differential equations in chapter 1, we turn now to an

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,440
example of a partial differential equation, the heat equation.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,280
To set things up, imagine you have some object, like a piece of metal, and you know how the

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,180
heat is distributed across it at any one moment, that is, what's the temperature of every

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,680
individual point along this plate.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,440
The question is, how will this distribution change over time, as the heat flows from warmer

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,720
spots to cooler ones?

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,920
The image on the left shows the temperature of an example plate using color, with the

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
graph of that temperature being shown on the right.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,860
To take a concrete one-dimensional example, let's say you have two different rods at

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,280
different temperatures, where that temperature is uniform along each one.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,880
You know that when you bring them into contact, the temperature will flow from the hot one

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,820
to the cool one, tending to make the whole thing equal over time.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,660
But how exactly?

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,380
What will the temperature distribution be at each point in time?

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,420
As is typical with differential equations, the idea is that it's easier to describe

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,000
how this setup changes from moment to moment than it is to jump straight to a description

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
of the full evolution.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,020
We write this rule of change in the language of derivatives, though as you'll see, we'll

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,260
need to expand our vocabulary a bit beyond ordinary derivatives.

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,060
And don't worry, we'll learn how to read the equations you're seeing now in just

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,020
a minute.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,580
Dividends of the heat equation show up in many other parts of math and physics, like

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,400
Brownian motion, the black-Scholes equations from finance, and all sorts of diffusion,

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,300
so there are many dividends to be had from a deep understanding of this one setup.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,340
In the last video we looked at ways of building understanding while acknowledging the truth

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,800
that most differential equations are simply too difficult to actually solve.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,380
And indeed, PDEs tend to be even harder than ODEs, largely because they involve modeling

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,280
infinitely many values changing in concert.

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,460
But our main character for today is an equation we can actually solve.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,460
In fact, if you've ever heard of Fourier series, you may be interested to know that

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,200
this is the physical problem which Babyface Fourier over here was trying to solve when

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,100
he stumbled across the corner of math that is now so replete with his name.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,960
We'll dig into Fourier series much more deeply in the next chapter, but I would like

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,140
to give you at least a little hint of the beautiful connection which is to come.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,340
This animation you're seeing right now shows how lots of little rotating vectors, each

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,860
rotating at some constant integer frequency, can trace out an arbitrary shape.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,380
To be clear, what's happening is that these vectors are being added together, tip to tail,

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,300
at each moment, and you might imagine that the last one has some sort of pencil at its

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,080
tip, tracing a path as it goes.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,460
For finitely many vectors, this tracing usually won't be a perfect replica of the target

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,160
shape, which in this animation is a lowercase f, but the more circles you include, the closer

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,300
it gets.

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,700
What you're seeing now uses only 100 circles, and I think you'd agree that the deviations

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,860
from the real shape are negligible.

46
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,340
What's mind-blowing is that just by tweaking the initial size and angle of each vector,

47
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,140
that gives you enough control to approximate any curve you want.

48
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,380
At first, this might seem like an idle curiosity, a neat art project, but little more.

49
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,620
In fact, the math that makes this possible is the same as the math describing the physics

50
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,340
of heat flow.

51
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,020
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,700
Step 1 is simply to build up the heat equation, and for that, let's start by being clear

53
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,700
about what the function we're analyzing is exactly.

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,460
We have a rod in one dimension, and we're thinking of it as sitting on an x-axis, so

55
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,540
each point of the rod is labeled with a unique number, x.

56
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,860
The temperature is some function of that position, t of x, shown here as a graph above it.

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,760
But really, since the value changes over time, we should think of this function as having

58
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,780
one more input, t, for time.

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,160
You could, if you wanted, think of this input space as being two-dimensional, representing

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,100
space and time together, with the temperature being graphed as a surface above it, each

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:23,180
slice across time showing you what that distribution looks like at any given moment.

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,660
Or you could simply think of this graph of temperature changing with time.

63
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,000
Both are equivalent.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,780
This surface is not to be confused with what I was showing earlier, the temperature graph

65
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,440
of a two-dimensional body.

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Be mindful when you're studying equations like these of whether time is being represented

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,700
with its own axis, or if it's being represented with literal changes over time, say in an

68
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,300
animation.

69
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,580
Last chapter, we looked at some systems where just a handful of numbers changed over time,

70
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,660
like the angle and angular velocity of a pendulum, describing that change in the language of

71
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,760
derivatives.

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,340
But when we have an entire function changing with time, the mathematical tools become slightly

73
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,820
more intricate.

74
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,240
As we're thinking of this temperature function with multiple dimensions to its input space,

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
in this case one for space and one for time, there are multiple different rates of change

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
at play.

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,280
There's the derivative with respect to x, how rapidly the temperature changes as you

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
move along the rod.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,480
You might think of this as the slope of our surface when you slice it parallel to the

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,880
x-axis, or given a tiny step in the x-direction and the tiny change to temperature caused

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,480
by it, giving a ratio between the two.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,940
But there's also the rate at which a single point on the rod changes with time, what you

83
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,620
might think of as the slope of the surface when you slice it in the other direction,

84
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,740
parallel to the time axis.

85
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Each one of these derivatives tells only part of the story for how this temperature function

86
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,660
changes, so we call them partial derivatives.

87
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,160
To emphasize this point, the notation changes a little, replacing the letter D with a special

88
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,500
curly D, sometimes called del.

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,800
Personally, I think it's a little silly to change the notation for this, since it's

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
essentially the same operation.

91
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,160
I would rather see notation that emphasizes that the delT terms up in the numerators refer

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,360
to different changes, one is a small change to temperature after a small change in time,

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,640
the other is a small change to temperature after a small step in space.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,440
To reiterate a point I made in the calculus series, I do think it's healthy to initially

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,860
read derivatives like this as a literal ratio between a small change to the function's

96
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,460
output and the small change to the input that caused it.

97
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,360
Just keep in mind that what this notation is meant to encode is the limit of that ratio

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,820
for smaller and smaller nudges to the input, rather than a specific value of the ratio

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,940
for a finitely small nudge.

100
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,700
This goes for partial derivatives just as much as it does for ordinary derivatives.

101
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:57,080
The heat equation is written in terms of these partial derivatives.

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,040
It tells us that the way this function changes with respect to time depends on how it changes

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,720
with respect to space.

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,200
More specifically, it's proportional to the second partial derivative with respect

105
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
to x.

106
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,900
At a high level, the intuition is that at points where the temperature distribution

107
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,760
curves, it tends to change more quickly in the direction of that curvature.

108
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,260
Since a rule like this is written using partial derivatives, we call it a partial differential

109
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
equation.

110
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,580
This has the funny result that to an outsider, the name sounds like a tamer version of ordinary

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,740
differential equations, when quite to the contrary partial differential equations tend

112
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,420
to tell a much richer story than ODEs, and are much harder to solve in general.

113
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,540
The general heat equation applies to bodies in any number of dimensions, which would mean

114
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,740
more inputs to our temperature function, but it'll be easiest for us to stay focused

115
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,240
on the one-dimensional case of a rod.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,620
As it is, graphing this in a way which gives time its own axis already pushes our visuals

117
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,460
into the third dimension.

118
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,620
So I threw out this equation, but where does this come from?

119
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,860
How could you think up something like this yourself?

120
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,100
For that, let's simplify things by describing a discrete version of the setup, where you

121
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,480
have only finitely many points x in a row.

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,220
This is sort of like working in a pixelated universe where instead of having a continuum

123
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,080
of temperatures, we have a finite set of separate values.

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,660
The intuition here is simple.

125
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,500
For a particular point, if its two neighbors on either side are on average hotter than

126
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,360
it is, it will heat up.

127
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,140
If they're cooler on average, it'll cool down.

128
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,900
Here, specifically focus on these three neighboring points, x1, x2, and x3, with corresponding

129
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,820
temperatures T1, T2, and T3.

130
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:45,580
What we want to compare is the average of T1 and T3 with the value of T2.

131
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,720
When this difference is greater than zero, T2 will heat up, and the bigger the difference,

132
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,560
the faster it heats up.

133
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:03,520
Likewise, if it's negative, T2 will cool down, at a rate proportional to that difference.

134
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,360
More formally, we write that the derivative of T2 with respect to time is proportional

135
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,680
to the difference between its neighbors and its own value.

136
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,460
Alpha here is simply a proportionality constant.

137
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,780
To write this in a way which will ultimately explain the second derivative in the heat

138
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,300
equation, let me rearrange this right hand a bit in terms of the difference between T1

139
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,140
and T2, and the difference between T2 and T3.

140
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,500
You can quickly check that these two are the same.

141
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,420
The top has half of T1, and in the bottom there are two minus signs in front of T1,

142
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,060
so it's positive, and the half has been factored out.

143
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,880
Likewise, both have half of T3.

144
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,640
Then on the bottom we have a negative T2 that's effectively written twice, so when you take

145
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,880
half of that, it's the same as the single negative T2 written up top.

146
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,460
Like I said, the reason to rewrite it is that it takes us a step closer to the language

147
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
of derivatives.

148
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,560
In fact, let's write these guys as delta T1 and delta T2.

149
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,820
It's the same value on the right hand side, but we're adding a new perspective to how

150
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,140
to think about it.

151
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,360
Instead of comparing the average of the neighbors to T2, we're thinking about the difference

152
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,740
of the differences.

153
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,020
Here, take a moment to gut check that this makes sense.

154
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,820
If those two differences are the same, then the average of T1 and T3 is the same as T2,

155
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,620
so T2 will not tend to change.

156
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,260
If delta T2 is bigger than delta T1, meaning the difference of the differences is positive,

157
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,600
notice how the average of T1 and T3 is bigger than T2, so T2 tends to increase.

158
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,680
And on the flip side, if the difference of the differences is negative, which means delta

159
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,320
T2 is smaller than delta T1, it corresponds to an average of these neighbors being less

160
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
than T2.

161
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,040
We could be especially compact with our notation and write this whole term, the difference

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,120
between the differences, as delta delta T1.

163
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,900
This is known in the lingo as a second difference.

164
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,340
If it feels a little weird to think about, keep in mind, it's essentially a compact

165
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,340
way of writing the idea of how much T2 differs from the average of its neighbors.

166
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,640
It just has this extra factor of one half, is all.

167
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,820
And that factor doesn't really matter, because either way we're writing this equation in

168
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,340
terms of some proportionality constant.

169
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,140
The upshot is that the rate of change for the temperature of a point is proportional

170
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,180
to the second difference around it.

171
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,800
As we go from this finite context to the infinite continuous case, the analog of a

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,840
second difference is the second derivative.

173
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,280
Instead of looking at the difference between the temperature values at points some fixed

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,060
distance apart, you instead consider what happens as you shrink the size of that step

175
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,600
towards zero.

176
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,720
And in calculus, instead of talking about absolute differences, which would also approach

177
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,860
zero, you think in terms of the rate of change.

178
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,280
In this case, what's the rate of change in temperature per unit distance?

179
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,960
And remember, there are two separate rates of change at play.

180
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,040
How does that temperature change as time progresses, and how does the temperature change as you

181
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
move along the rod?

182
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,800
The core intuition remains the same as what we had in the discrete case, to know how a

183
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,680
point differs from its neighbors, look not just at how the function changes from one

184
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,140
point to the next, but at how the rate of change itself changes.

185
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,600
Now in calculus land, we write this as del-squared t over del x-squared, the second partial derivative

186
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
of our function with respect to x.

187
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,940
Notice how this slope increases at points where the graph curves upwards, meaning the

188
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,360
rate of change of the rate of change is positive.

189
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,880
Similarly, that slope decreases at points where the graph curves downwards, where the

190
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,940
rate of change of this rate of change is negative.

191
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,120
Look that away as a meaningful intuition for problems well beyond the heat equation.

192
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,880
Second derivatives give a measure of how a value compares to the average of its neighbors.

193
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,040
Hopefully, that gives some satisfying added color to the equation.

194
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,760
It's already pretty intuitive when you read it as saying that curved points tend to flatten

195
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,700
out, but I think there's something even more satisfying about seeing a partial differential

196
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,800
equation like this arise almost mechanistically from thinking about each point as simply tending

197
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,000
towards the average of its neighbors.

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,580
Take a moment to compare what this feels like to the case of ordinary differential equations.

199
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,260
For example, if we have multiple bodies in space tugging at each other with gravity,

200
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,980
what we're analyzing is a handful of changing numbers, in this case the coordinates of each

201
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,140
object.

202
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,500
The rate of change for any one of these values depends on the values of the other numbers,

203
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,540
and we often write this down as a system of equations.

204
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,940
On the left, we have the derivative of each value with respect to time, and on the right

205
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,860
there's some combination of all the other values.

206
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,560
In our partial differential equation, the difference is that we have infinitely many

207
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,440
values changing from a continuum, and again, the way that any one of these values changes

208
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,720
depends on the other values, but quite helpfully, each one only depends on its immediate neighbors

209
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,520
in some limiting sense of the word neighbor.

210
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,600
So here, the relation on the right hand side is not a sum or product of the other numbers,

211
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,940
it's instead a kind of derivative, just a derivative with respect to space instead

212
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,960
of with respect to time.

213
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
In a sense, when you think about it, this one partial differential equation is like

214
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:32,020
a system of infinitely many equations, one for each point on the rod.

215
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,900
You might wonder about objects which are spread out in more than one dimension, like a plate

216
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
or something three-dimensional.

217
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,340
In that case, the equation looks quite similar, but you include the second derivative with

218
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,680
respect to the other spatial directions as well.

219
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,420
And adding up all of the second spatial derivatives like this is common enough as an operation

220
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,320
that it has its own special name, the Laplacian, often written as this upside-down triangle

221
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
squared.

222
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,400
It's essentially a multivariable version of the second derivative, and the intuition

223
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,820
for this equation is no different from the one-dimensional case.

224
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,780
This Laplacian can still be thought of as measuring how different is a point from the

225
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,640
average of its neighbors.

226
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,540
But now, these neighbors aren't just left and right of it, they're all around.

227
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,800
For the curious among you, I did a couple of videos during my time at Khan Academy on

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
this operator if you want to check them out.

229
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,280
For those of you with multivariable calculus under your belt, it's nice to think about

230
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,860
as the divergence of the gradient.

231
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,140
But you don't have to worry about that, for our purposes let's stay focused on the

232
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,120
one-dimensional case.

233
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,840
If you feel like you understand all of this, pat yourself on the back.

234
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,480
Being able to read a PDE is no joke, and it's a powerful addition to have to your vocabulary

235
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,200
for describing the world around you.

236
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,000
But after all this time spent interpreting the equations, I say it's high time we start

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,640
solving them, don't you?

238
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,720
And trust me, there are few pieces of math quite as satisfying as what Poodlehaired Fourier

239
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,660
over here developed to solve this problem.

240
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:05,120
All this and more in the next chapter.

241
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
I was originally motivated to cover this particular topic when I got an early view

242
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
of Steve Strogatz's new book Infinite Powers.

243
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
This isn't a sponsored message or anything like that, but all cards on the table I do

244
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,720
have two selfish ulterior motives for mentioning it.

245
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,600
The first is that Steve has been a really strong, maybe even pivotal, advocate for the

246
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,640
channel since the very beginning, and I've had an itch to repay that kindness for quite

247
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
a while.

248
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,120
And the second is to make more people love math, and calculus in particular.

249
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,000
That might not sound selfish, but think about it, when more people love math, the potential

250
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,440
audience base for these videos gets bigger.

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,080
And frankly there are few better ways to get people loving the subject than to expose them

252
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,940
to Strogatz's writing.

253
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,300
So if you have friends who you know who you think would enjoy the ideas of calculus but

254
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,420
maybe have been a bit intimidated by math in the past, this book does a really outstanding

255
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,840
job communicating the heart of the subject both substantively and excessively.

256
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,440
Its main theme is the idea of constructing solutions to complex real-world problems from

257
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,540
simple idealized building blocks, which as you'll see is exactly what Fourier did.

258
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,800
And for those of you who already know and love the subject, you will find no shortage

259
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,840
of fresh insights and enlightening stories.

260
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,200
I certainly enjoyed it.

261
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,600
Again, I know that sounds like an ad, but it's not, I just think you'll enjoy the

262
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,840
book.

263
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Thank you.
