1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,155
After seeing how we think about ordinary differential equations in chapter 1, 

2
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:12,520
we turn now to an example of a partial differential equation, the heat equation.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,844
To set things up, imagine you have some object, like a piece of metal, 

4
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:20,241
and you know how the heat is distributed across it at any one moment, 

5
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,880
that is, what's the temperature of every individual point along this plate.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,085
The question is, how will this distribution change over time, 

7
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:30,920
as the heat flows from warmer spots to cooler ones?

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,431
The image on the left shows the temperature of an example plate using color, 

9
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,340
with the graph of that temperature being shown on the right.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,755
To take a concrete one-dimensional example, let's say you have two different 

11
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:46,580
rods at different temperatures, where that temperature is uniform along each one.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,332
You know that when you bring them into contact, 

13
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,047
the temperature will flow from the hot one to the cool one, 

14
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:54,220
tending to make the whole thing equal over time.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,160
But how exactly?

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,040
What will the temperature distribution be at each point in time?

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,536
As is typical with differential equations, the idea is that it's 

18
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,762
easier to describe how this setup changes from moment to moment 

19
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:11,140
than it is to jump straight to a description of the full evolution.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,029
We write this rule of change in the language of derivatives, though as you'll see, 

21
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:19,580
we'll need to expand our vocabulary a bit beyond ordinary derivatives.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,480
And don't worry, we'll learn how to read the equations you're seeing now in just a minute.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,605
Variations of the heat equation show up in many other parts of math and physics, 

24
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:31,818
like Brownian motion, the black-Scholes equations from finance, 

25
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:35,733
and all sorts of diffusion, so there are many dividends to be had from a deep 

26
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,340
understanding of this one setup.

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,086
In the last video we looked at ways of building understanding while acknowledging 

28
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:46,120
the truth that most differential equations are simply too difficult to actually solve.

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,784
And indeed, PDEs tend to be even harder than ODEs, 

30
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:54,620
largely because they involve modeling infinitely many values changing in concert.

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,920
But our main character for today is an equation we can actually solve.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,922
In fact, if you've ever heard of Fourier series, 

33
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,859
you may be interested to know that this is the physical problem which Babyface 

34
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,896
Fourier over here was trying to solve when he stumbled across the corner of math 

35
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,740
that is now so replete with his name.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,267
We'll dig into Fourier series much more deeply in the next chapter, 

37
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:18,593
but I would like to give you at least a little hint of the beautiful connection 

38
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:19,300
which is to come.

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,454
This animation you're seeing right now shows how lots of little rotating vectors, 

40
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:30,700
each rotating at some constant integer frequency, can trace out an arbitrary shape.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,801
To be clear, what's happening is that these vectors are being added together, 

42
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:41,172
tip to tail, at each moment, and you might imagine that the last one 

43
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,100
has some sort of pencil at its tip, tracing a path as it goes.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,931
For finitely many vectors, this tracing usually won't be a 

45
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,018
perfect replica of the target shape, which in this animation is a lowercase f, 

46
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:55,760
but the more circles you include, the closer it gets.

47
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,372
What you're seeing now uses only 100 circles, and I think you'd 

48
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:02,340
agree that the deviations from the real shape are negligible.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,089
What's mind-blowing is that just by tweaking the initial size and angle of each vector, 

50
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:11,500
that gives you enough control to approximate any curve you want.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,160
At first, this might seem like an idle curiosity, a neat art project, but little more.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,489
In fact, the math that makes this possible is the 

53
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,340
same as the math describing the physics of heat flow.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,620
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

55
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,535
Step one is simply to build up the heat equation, and for that, 

56
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:39,820
let's start by being clear about what the function we're analyzing is exactly.

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,425
We have a rod in one dimension, and we're thinking of it as sitting on an x-axis, 

58
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,120
so each point of that rod is labeled with a unique number, x.

59
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,480
The temperature is some function of that position, t of x, shown here as a graph above it.

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,237
But really, since the value changes over time, 

61
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:04,800
we should think of this function as having one more input, t, for time.

62
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,782
You could, if you wanted, think of this input space as being two-dimensional, 

63
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:14,460
representing space and time together, with the temperature being graphed as a surface 

64
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,192
above it, each slice across time, showing you what that distribution looks like at any 

65
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:19,899
given moment.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,120
Or you could simply think of this graph of temperature changing with time.

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,420
Both are equivalent.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,802
This surface is not to be confused with what I was showing earlier, 

69
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:36,120
the temperature graph of a two-dimensional body.

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,627
Be mindful when you're studying equations like these of whether 

71
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,792
time is being represented with its own axis, or if it's being 

72
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,060
represented with literal changes over time, say in an animation.

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,358
Last chapter, we looked at some systems where just a handful of 

74
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:54,353
numbers changed over time, like the angle and angular velocity of a pendulum, 

75
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:57,120
describing that change in the language of derivatives.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
But when we have an entire function changing with time, 

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,100
the mathematical tools become slightly more intricate.

78
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,640
Because we're thinking of this temperature function with multiple 

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,717
dimensions to its input space, in this case one for space and one for time, 

80
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:13,560
there are multiple different rates of change at play.

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,759
There's the derivative with respect to x, how rapidly 

82
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,500
the temperature changes as you move along the rod.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,715
You might think of this as the slope of our surface when you slice it 

84
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:28,537
parallel to the x-axis, or given a tiny step in the x-direction and the 

85
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,360
tiny change to temperature caused by it, giving a ratio between the two.

86
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,008
But there's also the rate at which a single point on the rod changes with time, 

87
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:41,331
what you might think of as the slope of the surface when you slice 

88
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,960
it in the other direction, parallel to the time axis.

89
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,677
Each one of these derivatives tells only part of the story for how 

90
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:50,960
this temperature function changes, so we call them partial derivatives.

91
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,583
To emphasize this point, the notation changes a little, 

92
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,280
replacing the letter D with a special curly D, sometimes called del.

93
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,456
Personally, I think it's a little silly to change the 

94
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,120
notation for this since it's essentially the same operation.

95
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,630
I would rather see notation that emphasizes that the delT terms up in the numerators 

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,640
refer to different changes, one is a small change to temperature after a small change 

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,300
in time, the other is a small change to temperature after a small step in space.

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,840
To reiterate a point I made in the calculus series, 

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,750
I do think it's healthy to initially read derivatives like this as a literal 

100
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,710
ratio between a small change to the function's output and the small change to 

101
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,980
the input that caused it.

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,096
Just keep in mind that what this notation is meant to encode is the 

103
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:41,629
limit of that ratio for smaller and smaller nudges to the input, 

104
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,380
rather than a specific value of the ratio for a finitely small nudge.

105
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,440
This goes for partial derivatives just as much as it does for ordinary derivatives.

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,580
The heat equation is written in terms of these partial derivatives.

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,235
It tells us that the way this function changes with respect 

108
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:03,180
to time depends on how it changes with respect to space.

109
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,720
More specifically, it's proportional to the second partial derivative with respect to x.

110
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,764
At a high level, the intuition is that at points where the temperature distribution 

111
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:17,680
curves, it tends to change more quickly in the direction of that curvature.

112
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,216
Since a rule like this is written using partial derivatives, 

113
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,300
we call it a partial differential equation.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,269
This has the funny result that to an outsider, 

115
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,794
the name sounds like a tamer version of ordinary differential equations, 

116
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:33,947
when quite to the contrary, partial differential equations tend to tell a much richer 

117
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,700
story than ODEs, and are much harder to solve in general.

118
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,859
The general heat equation applies to bodies in any number of dimensions, 

119
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,655
which would mean more inputs to our temperature function, 

120
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:47,560
but it'll be easiest for us to stay focused on the one-dimensional case of a rod.

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,944
As it is, graphing this in a way which gives time its own 

122
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:53,740
axis already pushes our visuals into the third dimension.

123
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
So I threw out this equation, but where does this come from?

124
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,580
How could you think up something like this yourself?

125
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,001
Well, for that let's simplify things by describing a discrete version of the setup, 

126
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,800
where you have only finitely many points x in a row.

127
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,666
This is sort of like working in a pixelated universe where instead of 

128
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,300
having a continuum of temperatures, we have a finite set of separate values.

129
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
The intuition here is simple.

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,909
For a particular point, if its two neighbors on either 

131
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,260
side are on average hotter than it is, it will heat up.

132
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,660
If they're cooler on average, it'll cool down.

133
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,468
Here, specifically focus on these three neighboring points x1, 

134
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:37,260
x2, and x3, with corresponding temperatures T1, T2, and T3.

135
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,659
What we want to compare is the average of T1 and T3 with the value of T2.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,180
When this difference is greater than zero, T2 will tend to heat up.

137
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,460
And the bigger the difference, the faster it heats up.

138
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,910
Likewise, if it's negative, T2 will tend to cool down, 

139
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,240
at a rate proportional to that difference.

140
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,425
More formally, we write that the derivative of T2 with respect to time 

141
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:12,100
is proportional to the difference between its neighbors and its own value.

142
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,380
Alpha here is simply a proportionality constant.

143
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,200
To write this in a way which will ultimately explain the second derivative 

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,860
in the heat equation, let me rearrange this right hand a bit in terms of 

145
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,420
the difference between T1 and T2, and the difference between T2 and T3.

146
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,000
You can quickly check that these two are the same.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,714
The top has half of T1, and in the bottom there are two minus signs in front of T1, 

148
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:39,320
so it's positive, and the half has been factored out.

149
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Likewise, both have half of T3.

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,678
Then on the bottom we have a negative T2 that's effectively written twice, 

151
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:53,300
so when you take half of that it's the same as the single negative T2 written up top.

152
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,704
Like I said, the reason to rewrite it is that it 

153
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:00,200
takes us a step closer to the language of derivatives.

154
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,500
In fact, let's write these as delta T1 and delta T2.

155
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,350
It's the same value on the right hand side, but we're 

156
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,620
adding a new perspective to how to think about it.

157
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,767
Instead of comparing the average of the neighbors to T2, 

158
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:16,380
we're thinking about the difference of the differences.

159
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,400
Here, take a moment to gut check that this makes sense.

160
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,666
If those two differences are the same, then the average of T1 and T3 is the same as T2, 

161
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,700
so T2 will not tend to change.

162
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,468
If delta T2 is bigger than delta T1, meaning the difference of the differences is 

163
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:41,120
positive, notice how the average of T1 and T3 is bigger than T2, so T2 tends to increase.

164
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,014
And on the flip side, if the difference of the differences is negative, 

165
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,935
which means delta T2 is smaller than delta T1, 

166
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:54,100
it corresponds to an average of these neighbors being less than T2.

167
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,791
We could be especially compact with our notation and write this whole term, 

168
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,020
the difference between the differences, as delta delta T1.

169
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,280
This is known in the lingo as a second difference.

170
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,381
If it feels a little weird to think about, keep in mind, 

171
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:12,023
it's essentially a compact way of writing the idea of how much T2 differs from the 

172
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:13,120
average of its neighbors.

173
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,960
It just has this extra factor of one half, is all.

174
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
And that factor doesn't really matter, because either way we're 

175
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,520
writing this equation in terms of some proportionality constant.

176
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,221
The upshot is that the rate of change for the temperature of 

177
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:28,260
a point is proportional to the second difference around it.

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,789
As we go from this finite context to the infinite continuous case, 

179
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:36,020
the analog of a second difference is the second derivative.

180
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,578
Instead of looking at the difference between the temperature 

181
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,772
values at points some fixed distance apart, you instead consider 

182
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,820
what happens as you shrink the size of that step towards zero.

183
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,594
And in calculus, instead of talking about absolute differences, 

184
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:55,260
which would also approach zero, you think in terms of the rate of change.

185
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,420
In this case, what's the rate of change in temperature per unit distance?

186
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,540
And remember, there are two separate rates of change at play.

187
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,321
How does that temperature change as time progresses, 

188
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:08,200
and how does the temperature change as you move along the rod?

189
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
The core intuition remains the same as what we had in the discrete case.

190
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,573
To know how a point differs from its neighbors, 

191
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:18,034
look not just at how the function changes from one point to the next, 

192
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:20,260
but at how the rate of change itself changes.

193
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,385
Now in calculus land, we write this as del-squared t over del x-squared, 

194
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:31,440
the second partial derivative of our function with respect to x.

195
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,345
Notice how this slope increases at points where the graph curves upwards, 

196
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,780
meaning the rate of change of the rate of change is positive.

197
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,983
Similarly, that slope decreases at points where the graph curves downwards, 

198
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:48,460
where the rate of change of this rate of change is negative.

199
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,420
Tuck that away as a meaningful intuition for problems well beyond the heat equation.

200
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,320
Second derivatives give a measure of how a value compares to the average of its neighbors.

201
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,440
Hopefully that gives some satisfying added color to the equation.

202
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,577
It's already pretty intuitive when you read it as saying that curved points tend 

203
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,190
to flatten out, but I think there's something even more satisfying about seeing 

204
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,622
a partial differential equation like this arise almost mechanistically from 

205
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:17,280
thinking about each point as simply tending towards the average of its neighbors.

206
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,967
Take a moment to compare what this feels like 

207
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,080
to the case of ordinary differential equations.

208
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,141
For example, if we have multiple bodies in space tugging at each other with gravity, 

209
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,118
what we're analyzing is a handful of changing numbers, 

210
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,500
in this case the coordinates of each object.

211
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,963
The rate of change for any one of these values depends on the values of 

212
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:41,880
the other numbers, and we often write this down as a system of equations.

213
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,709
On the left, we have the derivative of each value with respect to time, 

214
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,220
and on the right there's some combination of all the other values.

215
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,298
In our partial differential equation, the difference is that we have infinitely 

216
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:58,122
many values changing from a continuum, and again, 

217
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:02,301
the way that any one of these values changes depends on the other values, 

218
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:06,706
but quite helpfully, each one only depends on its immediate neighbors in some 

219
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,740
limiting sense of the word neighbor.

220
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,028
So here, the relation on the right hand side is not a sum or product 

221
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:16,109
of the other numbers, it's instead a kind of derivative, 

222
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:20,000
just a derivative with respect to space instead of with respect to time.

223
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,032
In a sense, when you think about it, this one partial differential equation 

224
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:29,240
is like a system of infinitely many equations, one for each point on the rod.

225
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,104
You might wonder about objects which are spread out in more than one dimension, 

226
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,940
like a plate, or something three dimensional.

227
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,433
In that case the equation looks quite similar, 

228
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:43,252
but you include the second derivative with respect to the other spatial 

229
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:44,260
directions as well.

230
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,915
And adding up all of these second spatial derivatives like this 

231
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:52,323
is common enough as an operation that it has its own special name, 

232
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,680
the Laplacian, often written as this upside down triangle squared.

233
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,455
It's essentially a multivariable version of the second derivative, 

234
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:03,220
and the intuition for this equation is no different from the one dimensional case.

235
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,048
This Laplacian can still be thought of as measuring how different 

236
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,146
is a point from the average of its neighbors, but now these 

237
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,400
neighbors aren't just left and right of it, they're all around.

238
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,079
For the curious among you, I did a couple of videos during my time 

239
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,640
at Khan Academy on this operator if you want to go check them out.

240
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,552
For those of you with multivariable calculus under your belt, 

241
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:26,020
it's nice to think about as the divergence of the gradient.

242
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,749
But you don't have to worry about that, for our 

243
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:31,140
purposes let's stay focused on the one dimensional case.

244
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,220
If you feel like you understand all of this, pat yourself on the back.

245
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,097
Being able to read a PDE is no joke, and it's a powerful addition 

246
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:42,360
to have to your vocabulary for describing the world around you.

247
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,265
But after all of this time spent interpreting the equations, 

248
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:49,120
I say it's high time we start solving them, don't you?

249
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,692
And trust me, there are few pieces of math quite as satisfying as 

250
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:55,920
what Poodlehaired Fourier over here developed to solve this problem.

251
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,500
All this and more in the next chapter.

252
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,761
I was originally motivated to cover this particular topic when 

253
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,920
I got an early view of Steve Strogatz's new book Infinite Powers.

254
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,157
This isn't a sponsored message or anything like that, 

255
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:18,260
but all cards on the table I do have two selfish ulterior motives for mentioning it.

256
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,893
The first is that Steve has been a really strong, maybe even pivotal, 

257
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,234
advocate for the channel since the very beginning, 

258
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,080
and I've had an itch to repay that kindness for quite a while.

259
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,400
And the second is to make more people love math, and calculus in particular.

260
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,434
That might not sound selfish, but think about it, when more people love math, 

261
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:37,900
the potential audience base for these videos gets bigger.

262
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,865
And frankly there are few better ways to get people loving 

263
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:43,140
the subject than to expose them to Strogatz's writing.

264
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,644
So if you have friends who you know who you think would enjoy the ideas of calculus 

265
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:50,303
but maybe have been a bit intimidated by math in the past, 

266
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,908
this book does a really outstanding job communicating the heart of the subject, 

267
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,440
both substantively and accessibly.

268
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,988
Its main theme is the idea of constructing solutions to complex real-world problems 

269
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:04,700
from simple idealized building blocks, which as you'll see is exactly what Fourier did.

270
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,849
And for those of you who already know and love the subject, 

271
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,619
you will find no shortage of fresh insights and enlightening stories.

272
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,060
I certainly enjoyed it.

273
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,831
Again, I kinda know that sounds like an ad, but it's not, 

274
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,599
I just actually think you'll enjoy the book.
