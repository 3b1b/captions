1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,875
Every year, more than 100 countries send six of their brightest teenagers, 

2
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:10,615
or the occasional prepubescent prodigy, to represent them at the 

3
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:13,780
International Math Olympiad, commonly known as the IMO.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,357
Considering that each country has its own elaborate system of contests leading 

5
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:22,102
to their choice of six representatives, the IMO stands as the culminating 

6
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:26,100
symbol for the surprisingly expansive and wonderful world that is contest math.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,300
The contest itself is essentially a test, split over two days, 

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,880
with three questions given over four and a half hours each day.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,918
The questions are all proofs, meaning you don't simply find some numerical answer, 

10
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:43,158
you have to discover and articulate a rigorous line of reasoning to answer each 

11
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:47,080
difficult question, and then each one is scored on a scale from 0 up to 7.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,605
Of interest to you and me today is the one from 2011, 

13
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:55,380
with 563 total participants representing 101 countries.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,120
I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes, 

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,320
those do all happen to be prime numbers.

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,380
But that's not why this test was interesting.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,763
Out of all these prime problem solvers, only one of them, 

18
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:09,200
Lisa Sauermann from Germany, got a perfect score.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,494
And the only thing standing between the next two runners 

20
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,280
up that year and a perfect score was problem number two.

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,953
And this problem is beautiful, and despite evading many of the world's best 

22
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:24,547
mathematicians of their age, the solution is something that anyone watching this video 

23
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:25,340
can understand.

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,640
So let's begin by reading through it carefully.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,460
Let S be a finite set of at least two points on the plane.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,848
Okay, so as you read the question it's often helpful 

27
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,680
to start drawing an example for yourself.

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,833
Assume that no three points of S are collinear, 

29
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,615
in other words you never have three points lining up, 

30
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:47,788
so you can probably predict that the problem's going to involve drawing lines in 

31
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,880
some way that three points on one line would mess things up.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,020
A windmill is a process that starts with the line L going through a single point P in S.

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,217
The line rotates clockwise around the pivot P until the first 

34
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:04,620
time that that line meets some other point belonging to S.

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,940
And again, while reading it's helpful to draw out an example so we've 

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,360
got this line that's pivoting around some point until it hits another.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,936
This point, Q, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now 

38
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,860
rotates clockwise about Q until it next meets a point of S.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,120
This process continues indefinitely.

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,420
Alright, that's kind of fun.

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,045
We keep rotating and changing the pivot, and you can see why they call it a windmill 

42
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:34,340
process, and you can also see why they specified that no three points lie on one line.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,740
You wouldn't want to run into the ambiguity where you don't know which pivot to switch to.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Okay, so with all this setup, what's the question?

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,133
Show that we can choose a point P in S and a line L going through P such that 

46
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:53,280
the resulting windmill uses each point of S as a pivot infinitely many times.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,978
Alright, depending on your tolerance of puzzles for puzzle's sake, 

48
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,200
you might wonder why would anyone care about such a question?

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,340
There's a very good reason, in fact.

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,932
I would argue that the act of solving this will make you better at math 

51
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:10,140
and related fields, and I'll explain why once you've seen the solution.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,540
But certainly on the surface, it feels disconnected from other parts of math.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,343
I mean, you look at other Olympiad problems, and they often involve 

54
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:21,187
some function to analyze, or a numerical pattern to deduce, 

55
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:24,600
maybe a difficult counting setup or an elaborate geometric construction.

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,600
But problem two, it's an unusually pure puzzle, and in some ways that's its charm.

57
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,159
Proving that some initial condition will result in this windmill hitting all the points 

58
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,100
infinitely many times, well that doesn't test your knowledge of a particular theorem.

59
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,080
It tests if you can find a clever perspective.

60
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,480
But that blade cuts both ways.

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,286
Without resting on an existing result from math, 

62
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:50,760
what could possibly prepare someone to study for something like this?

63
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,780
And in fact, that brings us to the second unusual thing about this problem.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,907
Based on the results, I'm guessing that it turned out 

65
00:03:57,907 --> 00:04:00,380
to be much harder than the contest organizers expected.

66
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,420
You see, typically the three problems each day are supposed to get progressively harder.

67
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,420
They're all hard, of course, it's the IMO, but problems one and four should be doable.

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,840
Problems two and five, they're challenging.

69
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,840
And problems three and six, well they can be brutal.

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,809
But take a look at how many of our 563 participants 

71
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:23,000
that year got perfect scores on each of the problems.

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Only 22 of them got full marks for question number two.

73
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,584
By contrast, 170 got a perfect score on problem five, 

74
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,403
which is supposed to be about the same difficulty, 

75
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:38,106
and more than twice as many got a perfect score for problem three, 

76
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,820
which is supposed to be harder.

77
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,302
Some of you might notice that only six students got full points for problem 

78
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,660
six that year, so by some measure that was the hardest problem on the test.

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,707
In fact, the way I introduced things earlier was a little disingenuous, 

80
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,860
the full data would suggest that problem six was the real clincher.

81
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,684
But what's strange is that if you look at the results of those six students 

82
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:04,299
who solved this hardest problem, all of whom are clearly phenomenal world-class 

83
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:08,280
problem solvers, this windmill puzzle evaded five out of six of them.

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,097
But again, this problem is not hard because of the background knowledge it demands, 

85
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,400
it asks only for insight.

86
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,240
So how do you approach something like this?

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,110
The first step with any puzzle is to simply play around with it and get a feel for it, 

88
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,000
and it's always good to start simple and slowly get more complicated from there.

89
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,920
The simplest case would be two points, where the line trades off between each point.

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,300
That works well enough.

91
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,580
Adding a third point, it's pretty clear that the line will just rotate around them.

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,976
It might not be entirely clear how you would phrase this as a rigorous proof yet, 

93
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,300
but right now we're just getting a feel for things.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,660
The fourth point is where it gets interesting.

95
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,565
In some places, your windmill will go around the four points just like it did with the 

96
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:58,640
triangle, but if we put it inside that triangle, it looks like our windmill never hits it.

97
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,780
Looking back at the problem, it's asking you to show that for some starting position of 

98
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,120
the line, not any position, the process will hit all the points infinitely many times.

99
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,563
So for an example like this, if you start with the line 

100
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:15,240
going through that troublesome middle point, what happens?

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,488
Again, we're just playing around, perhaps moving your 

102
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:21,120
pencil among dots you've drawn on a piece of scratch paper.

103
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,980
You want to believe a result before you try too hard to prove it.

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,964
Here you'd see that your windmill does indeed bounce off of all the 

105
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:32,400
points as it goes through a cycle, and it ends up back where it started.

106
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,406
The worry you might have is that in some large sets of points, 

107
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:41,026
where some are kind of inside the others, you might be able to start off on the inside, 

108
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:45,173
but maybe something about this windmill process takes the line to the outside, 

109
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:49,320
where as time goes on to infinity it'll be blocked off from those inner points.

110
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,823
If you play around, and mind you it can take some time to draw out many 

111
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:58,181
examples and think this through, you would notice that when the line 

112
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:01,880
starts off passing through the middle of the points, it tends to stay there.

113
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,620
It never seems to venture off to the outside.

114
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,160
But can you guarantee that this will always happen?

115
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,649
Or rather, can you first make this idea of starting in the middle a little more rigorous, 

116
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,640
and from there prove that all the points will be hit infinitely many times?

117
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,066
As a general problem-solving tip, whenever you have a vague idea that feels productive, 

118
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:47,908
you should of course find a way to be more exact about what you're saying, 

119
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:52,210
but preferably put numbers to it, and then see if you can ask questions about those 

120
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,620
numbers.

121
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,440
In our example, one way to formalize this idea of a middle 

122
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,620
is to count how many points are on either side of the line.

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,489
If you give the line some orientation, you can reasonably talk about a left half, 

124
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,758
say coloring all the points on the left blue, and a right half, 

125
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:10,160
say coloring all the points on the right brown.

126
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,504
And what it means for a line to be in the middle is that 

127
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:16,200
there are as many blue points as there are brown points.

128
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,454
For the moment, let's say that the total number of points is an odd number, 

129
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:25,340
and the point that the line passes through is colored white, sort of a neutral color.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,433
So for example, if there were 11 points, you would have 5 blue ones on the left, 

131
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:34,100
5 brown ones on the right, and the single white point as the pivot.

132
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,299
The case with an even number of points will be similar, just slightly less symmetric.

133
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,380
What this gives us is a new question to ask.

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,300
What happens to the number of blue points and brown points as the process plays out?

135
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,900
In the example on screen now, you might notice it's always 5 and 5, never changing.

136
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,340
Playing around with other examples, you would find that the same is true.

137
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,524
Take a moment to pause right now, and see if you 

138
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:03,840
can think through why exactly that would happen.

139
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,800
Why would these numbers not change?

140
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,840
Well, the key is to think through what happens as the line changes its pivot.

141
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,584
Having given the line an orientation, we can talk reasonably 

142
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,560
about which half is above the pivot, and which one is below.

143
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,540
If the line hits a blue point on its left, it must happen below the pivot.

144
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,086
So then when it changes the pivot and continues rotating clockwise a bit, that old pivot, 

145
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:45,520
now above the new one, ends up to the left, meaning it ends up in the blue region.

146
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,061
And entirely symmetrically, when it hits a brown point, 

147
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:53,420
it happens above the pivot, meaning that the old pivot ends up in the brown region.

148
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,267
So no matter what, the number of points on a given side of the line cannot change, 

149
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,260
except for the instances where the line is passing through two points at once.

150
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,680
When you lose a blue point, you gain a new one.

151
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,020
When you lose a brown point, you gain a new one.

152
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,760
And that is our key insight number one.

153
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,041
So why would this imply that the line must hit every point infinitely many times, 

154
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,940
no matter what weird set of points you could dream up?

155
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,296
The second key is to think about letting this process 

156
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:25,280
go until the line has turned 180 degrees around.

157
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,460
What that means is that it's parallel to the starting position, 

158
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,188
and because it has to remain the case that half the points are on one side 

159
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,866
and half the points are on the other, it must be passing through the same 

160
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:36,860
point it started on.

161
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,915
I mean, think about it, if it ended up on some other point, 

162
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:43,120
it would change the number on a given side.

163
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,743
Additionally, since the line has rotated halfway around, 

164
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:55,684
everything that was blue has become brown, and everything which was 

165
00:10:55,684 --> 00:11:00,900
brown has become blue, and the only way to change the color is if you get hit by the line.

166
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,445
So for our odd-numbered case, that means that after a half rotation, 

167
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:15,500
the line is back where it started, and it's hit all of the other points.

168
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,716
So as time goes forward, it repeats this exact set of motions over and over, 

169
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:23,740
hitting all of those points infinitely many times.

170
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,452
For the case with an even number of points, we need to alter the scheme slightly, 

171
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,360
but only slightly.

172
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,966
To make it so that the number of blues can equal the number of browns, 

173
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,240
let's say that the pivot counts now as a brown point.

174
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,026
So to define our initial condition, we still say for a given angle of the line, 

175
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:48,050
select an initial point so that half of the points are blue, all on the left, 

176
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,280
and half of them are brown, now either meaning they're on the right, or the pivot.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,919
The same argument from before implies that after a 180° turn, 

178
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,851
everything has swapped colors, but this time the line will be passing through 

179
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:07,225
a different point after that first half turn, specifically one that used to be blue, 

180
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:12,220
but after another 180° it has to be passing through the one that it started on.

181
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,620
Again, the logic is that it's parallel to its starting position, 

182
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,949
and if it was passing through any other point, 

183
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:22,120
the number of points on a given side would have to be different.

184
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,010
So once more, we have a cycle which hits all of the points, 

185
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,600
and which ends in the same position where it started.

186
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,105
This time it takes 360°, but that doesn't matter, 

187
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:36,200
as the cycle continues it'll hit all the points infinitely many times.

188
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,807
Stepping back, there are two important lessons to take away from this puzzle, 

189
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,300
the first one social and the second one mathematical.

190
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,274
Once you know this solution, and if you ponder it a bit and 

191
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:53,493
turn it around in your head a couple times, it's very easy to 

192
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:56,920
fool yourself into thinking that the problem is easier than it is.

193
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,100
After all, of course the number of points on a given side stays constant, right?

194
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,900
Of course that's a question you would ask.

195
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,506
And of course when you start in the middle, every 

196
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,360
point will switch sides after a half a turn.

197
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,838
But the advantage of this problem coming from the IMO is that we 

198
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:14,540
don't have to rest on In the subject of statements, 

199
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,450
we have the data to show it's a genuinely hard problem, 

200
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,244
in that it evaded many of the world's best students who are demonstrably 

201
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:22,700
able to solve hard problems.

202
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,020
In math, it's extremely hard to empathize with 

203
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,480
what it feels like to not understand something.

204
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,852
I was discussing this video with a former coworker of mine from Khan Academy, 

205
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:35,547
who worked a lot with people creating math exercises, 

206
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:39,740
and he pointed out that across a wide variety of contributors, there's one constant.

207
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,540
Nobody is able to tell how difficult their exercises are.

208
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,400
Knowing when math is hard is way harder than the math itself.

209
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,311
This is important to keep in mind when teaching, 

210
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:53,140
but it's equally important to keep in mind when being taught.

211
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,188
On our windmill puzzle, even if counting the number of points on one side 

212
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:03,815
seems obvious in hindsight, you have to ask, given the vast space of possible 

213
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:08,560
things you might consider, Why would anyone's mind turn to that particular idea?

214
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,800
This brings us to the mathematical takeaway.

215
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,205
What ultimately led to the solution was finding something about the 

216
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:19,860
complex system which stays constant during this chaotic unfolding.

217
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,080
This is a ubiquitous theme through math, and especially through physics.

218
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,580
We're finding what's called an invariant.

219
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,220
Topologists do this when they count the number of holes in a surface.

220
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,247
Physicists do this when they define the ideas of energy and momentum, 

221
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:38,160
or in special relativity when they define more abstract ideas like proper time.

222
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,936
As a student, it's easy to take for granted the definitions handed down to you, 

223
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:46,533
but the more puzzles you solve where the insight involves an invariant, 

224
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:50,780
the more you come to appreciate that each one of these definitions was once a clever 

225
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,280
discovery.

226
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,522
Terence Tao, one of the greatest modern mathematicians and the world's 

227
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:01,165
youngest IMO medalist, wrote that mathematical problems or puzzles are 

228
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:05,269
important to real mathematics, like solving real-life problems, just as fables, 

229
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,220
stories, and anecdotes are important to the young in understanding real life.

230
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,300
Sure, these kinds of puzzles are contrived, but they carry lessons 

231
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,660
relevant to useful problems you may actually need to solve one day.

232
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,799
Maybe it seems silly to liken this windmill puzzle to a fairy tale, 

233
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,974
a mathematical Aesop summarizing that the moral of the story is to seek quantities 

234
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:25,980
which stay constant.

235
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,291
But some of you watching this will one day face a problem where finding an invariant 

236
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:39,480
reveals a slick solution, and you might even look like a genius for doing so.
