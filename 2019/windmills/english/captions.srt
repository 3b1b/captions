1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Every year, more than 100 countries send six of their brightest teenagers, or the occasional

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,380
prepubescent prodigy, to represent them at the International Math Olympiad, commonly

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,440
known as the IMO.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,600
Considering that each country has its own elaborate system of contests leading to their

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,440
choice of six representatives, the IMO stands as the culminating symbol for the surprisingly

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,940
expansive and wonderful world that is contest math.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,720
The contest itself is essentially a test, split over two days, with three questions

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,560
given over 4.5 hours each day.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,240
The questions are all proofs, meaning you don't simply find some numerical answer,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,020
you have to discover and articulate a rigorous line of reasoning to answer each difficult

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,960
question, and then each one is scored on a scale from 0 up to 7.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,240
Of interest to you and me today is the one from 2011, with 563 total participants representing

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
101 countries.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:02,000
I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes, those do all happen to be prime numbers.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But that's not why this test was interesting.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,360
Out of all these prime problem solvers, only one of them, Lisa Sauermann from Germany,

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,820
got a perfect score.

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,080
And the only thing standing between the next two runners up that year and a perfect score

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,040
was problem number two.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,800
And this problem is beautiful, and despite evading many of the world's best mathematicians

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,400
of their age, the solution is something that anyone watching this video can understand.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
So let's begin by reading through it carefully.

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,000
Let S be a finite set of at least two points on the plane.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay, so as you read the question it's often helpful to start drawing an example for yourself.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Assume that no three points of S are collinear, in other words you never have three points

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,560
lining up, so you can probably predict that the problem's going to involve drawing lines

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,440
in some way that three points on one line would mess things up.

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,640
A windmill is a process that starts with the line L going through a single point P in S.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,600
The line rotates clockwise around the pivot P until the first time that that line meets

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,880
some other point belonging to S. And again, while reading it's helpful to draw out an

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,360
example so we've got this line that's pivoting around some point until it hits another.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,120
This point, Q, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about Q

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
until it next meets a point of S. This process continues indefinitely.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Alright, that's kind of fun.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,640
We keep rotating and changing the pivot, and you can see why they call it a windmill process,

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,960
and you can also see why they specified that no three points lie on one line.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,520
You wouldn't want to run into the ambiguity where you don't know which pivot to switch

38
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
to.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Okay, so with all this setup, what's the question?

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,760
Show that we can choose a point P in S and a line L going through P such that the resulting

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,160
windmill uses each point of S as a pivot infinitely many times.

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,600
Alright, depending on your tolerance of puzzles for puzzles' sake, you might wonder why

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,440
would anyone care about such a question?

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,720
There's a very good reason, in fact.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,160
I would argue that the act of solving this will make you better at math and related fields,

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,820
and I'll explain why once you've seen the solution.

47
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,660
But certainly on the surface, it feels disconnected from other parts of math.

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,320
I mean, you look at other Olympiad problems and they often involve some function to analyze,

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,100
or a numerical pattern to deduce, maybe a difficult counting setup or an elaborate geometric

50
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,280
construction.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,220
But problem two, it's an unusually pure puzzle, and in some ways that's its charm.

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,540
Proving that some initial condition will result in this windmill hitting all the points infinitely

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,780
many times, well that doesn't test your knowledge of a particular theorem.

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,060
It tests if you can find a clever perspective.

55
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,080
But that blade cuts both ways.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,220
Without resting on an existing result from math, what could possibly prepare someone

57
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,420
to study for something like this?

58
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,740
And in fact, that brings us to the second unusual thing about this problem.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,320
Based on the results, I'm guessing that it turned out to be much harder than the contest

60
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,500
organizers expected.

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,020
You see, typically the three problems each day are supposed to get progressively harder.

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,060
They're all hard, of course, it's the IMO, but problems one and four should be doable,

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,780
problems two and five are challenging, and problems three and six can be brutal.

64
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,820
But take a look at how many of our 563 participants that year got perfect scores on each of the

65
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,180
problems.

66
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,460
Only 22 of them got full marks for question number two.

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,540
By contrast, 170 got a perfect score on problem five, which is supposed to be about the same

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,900
difficulty, and more than twice as many got a perfect score for problem three, which is

69
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
supposed to be harder.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,820
Some of you might notice that only six students got full points for problem six that year,

71
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,380
so by some measure that was the hardest problem on the test.

72
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,740
In fact, the way I introduced things earlier was a little disingenuous, the full data would

73
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,540
suggest that problem six was the real clincher.

74
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,740
But what's strange is that if you look at the results of those six students who solved

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,260
this hardest problem, all of whom are clearly phenomenal world-class problem solvers, this

76
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,980
windmill puzzle evaded five out of six of them.

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,080
But again, this problem is not hard because of the background knowledge it demands, it

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,420
asks only for insight.

79
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,100
So how do you approach something like this?

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,220
The first step with any puzzle is to simply play around with it and get a feel for it,

81
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,620
and it's always good to start simple and slowly get more complicated from there.

82
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,480
The simplest case would be two points, where the line trades off between each point.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,060
That works well enough.

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,460
Adding a third point, it's pretty clear that the line will just rotate around them.

85
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,600
It might not be entirely clear how you would phrase this as a rigorous proof yet, but right

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,040
now we're just getting a feel for things.

87
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,300
The fourth point is where it gets interesting.

88
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,900
In some places, your windmill will go around the four points just like it did with the

89
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,120
triangle.

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,520
But if we put it inside that triangle, it looks like our windmill never hits it.

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Looking back at the problem, it's asking you to show that for some starting position

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,240
of the line, not any position, the process will hit all the points infinitely many times.

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,880
So for an example like this, if you start with the line going through that troublesome

94
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,920
middle point, what happens?

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,440
And again, at this point we're just playing around, perhaps moving your pencil among dots

96
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
that you've drawn on a piece of scratch paper.

97
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,920
You want to believe a result before you try too hard to prove it.

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,960
Here you'd see that your windmill does indeed bounce off of all the points as it goes through

99
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,160
a cycle, and it ends up back where it started.

100
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,960
The worry you might have is that in some large sets of points, where some are kind of inside

101
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,600
the others, you might be able to start off on the inside, but maybe something about this

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,580
windmill process takes the line to the outside, where as time goes on to infinity it'll

103
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,720
be blocked off from those inner points.

104
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,820
If you play around, and mind you it can take some time to draw out many examples and think

105
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,580
this through, you would notice that when the line starts off passing through the middle

106
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,680
of the points, it tends to stay there.

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,300
It never seems to venture off to the outside.

108
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,980
But can you guarantee that this will always happen?

109
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,220
Or rather, can you first make this idea of starting in the middle a little more rigorous,

110
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:40,020
and from there prove that all the points will be hit infinitely many times?

111
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,640
As a general problem-solving tip, whenever you have a vague idea that feels productive,

112
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,500
you should of course find a way to be more exact about what you're saying, but preferably

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,380
put numbers to it, and then see if you can ask questions about those numbers.

114
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,300
In our example, one way to formalize this idea of a middle is to count how many points

115
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,520
are on either side of the line.

116
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,000
If you give the line some orientation, you can reasonably talk about a left half, say

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,300
coloring all the points of the left blue, and a right half, say coloring all the points

118
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,700
on the right brown, and what it means for a line to be in the middle is that there are

119
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,060
as many blue points as there are brown points.

120
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,740
For the moment, let's say that the total number of points is an odd number, and the

121
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,220
point that the line passes through is colored white, sort of a neutral color.

122
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,440
For example, if there were 11 points, you would have 5 blue ones on the left, 5 brown

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
ones on the right, and the single white point as the pivot.

124
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,320
The case with an even number of points will be similar, just slightly less symmetric.

125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,040
What this gives us is a new question to ask.

126
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:49,140
What happens to the number of blue points and brown points as the process plays out?

127
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,800
In the example on screen now, you might notice it's always 5 and 5, never changing.

128
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,280
Playing around with other examples, you would find that the same is true.

129
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,360
Take a moment to pause right now, and see if you can think through why exactly that

130
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
would happen.

131
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Why would these numbers not change?

132
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:24,640
Well, the key is to think through what happens as the line changes its pivot.

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,760
Having given the line an orientation, we can talk reasonably about which half is above

134
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,460
the pivot, and which one is below.

135
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,220
If the line hits a blue point on its left, it must happen below the pivot.

136
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,020
So then when it changes the pivot and continues rotating clockwise a bit, that old pivot,

137
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,340
now above the new one, ends up to the left, meaning it ends up in the blue region.

138
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,200
And entirely symmetrically, when it hits a brown point, it happens above the pivot, meaning

139
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,140
that the old pivot ends up in the brown region.

140
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,260
So no matter what, the number of points on a given side of the line cannot change, except

141
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,960
for the instances where the line is passing through two points at once.

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,140
When you lose a blue point, you gain a new one.

143
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,700
When you lose a brown point, you gain a new one.

144
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,820
And that is our key insight number 1.

145
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,500
So why would this imply that the line must hit every point infinitely many times, no

146
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,340
matter what weird set of points you could dream up?

147
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,820
The second key is to think about letting this process go until the line has turned 180 degrees

148
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
around.

149
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,000
What that means is that it's parallel to the starting position, and because it has

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,540
to remain the case that half the points are on one side and half the points are on the

151
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,180
other, it must be passing through the same point it started on.

152
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,940
I mean, think about it, if it ended up on some other point, it would change the number

153
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,500
on a given side.

154
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,660
Additionally, since the line has rotated halfway around, everything that was blue has become

155
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,700
brown, and everything which was brown has become blue, and the only way to change the

156
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,860
color is if you get hit by the line.

157
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,120
So for our odd-numbered case, that means that after a half rotation, the line is back where

158
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,380
it started, and it's hit all of the other points.

159
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,260
So as time moves forward, it repeats this exact set of motions over and over, hitting

160
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,700
all of those points infinitely many times.

161
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,660
For the case with an even number of points, we need to alter the scheme slightly, but

162
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,020
only slightly.

163
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,340
To make it so that the number of blues can equal the number of browns, let's say that

164
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,980
the pivot counts now as a brown point.

165
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,340
So to define our initial condition, we still say for a given angle of the line, select

166
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,420
an initial point so that half of the points are blue, all on the left, and half of them

167
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,100
are brown, now either meaning they're on the right, or the pivot.

168
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,900
The same argument from before implies that after a 180° turn, everything has swapped

169
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,380
colors, but this time the line will be passing through a different point after that first

170
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,400
half turn, specifically one that used to be blue, but after another 180° it has to be

171
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,020
passing through the one that it started on.

172
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,020
Again, the logic is that it's parallel to its starting position, and if it was passing

173
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,140
through any other point, the number of points on a given side would have to be different.

174
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,580
So once more, we have a cycle which hits all of the points, and which ends in the same

175
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,300
position where it started.

176
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,080
This time it takes 360°, but that doesn't matter, as the cycle continues it'll hit

177
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,500
all the points infinitely many times.

178
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,560
Stepping back, there are two important lessons to take away from this puzzle, the first one

179
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,580
social and the second one mathematical.

180
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,500
Once you know this solution, and if you ponder it a bit and turn it around in your head a

181
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,600
couple times, it's very easy to fool yourself into thinking the problem is easier than it is.

182
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,220
After all, of course the number of points on a given side stays constant, right?

183
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,660
Of course that's a question you would ask.

184
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,940
And of course when you start in the middle, every point will switch sides after a half

185
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,600
a turn.

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,840
But the advantage of this problem coming from the IMO is that we don't have to rest on

187
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,920
subjective statements, we have the data to show it's a genuinely hard problem, in that

188
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,680
it evaded many of the world's best students who are demonstrably able to solve hard problems.

189
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,160
In math, it's extremely hard to empathize with what it feels like to not understand

190
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
something.

191
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,860
I was discussing this video with a former coworker of mine from Khan Academy, who worked

192
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,740
a lot with people creating math exercises, and he pointed out that across a wide variety

193
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,520
of contributors, there's one constant.

194
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,140
Nobody is able to tell how difficult their exercises are.

195
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,120
Knowing when math is hard is way harder than the math itself.

196
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,260
This is important to keep in mind when teaching, but it's equally important to keep in mind

197
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,960
when being taught.

198
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,640
On our windmill puzzle, even if counting the number of points on one side seems obvious

199
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,680
in hindsight, you have to ask, given the vast space of possible things you might consider,

200
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,080
why would anyone's mind turn to that particular idea?

201
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,500
This brings us to the mathematical takeaway.

202
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,440
What ultimately led to the solution was finding something about the complex system which stays

203
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,960
constant during this chaotic unfolding.

204
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,320
This is a ubiquitous theme through math, and especially through physics.

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
We're finding what's called an invariant.

206
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,920
Topologists do this when they count the number of holes in a surface.

207
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,860
Physicists do this when they define the ideas of energy and momentum, or in special relativity,

208
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,000
when they define more abstract ideas, like proper time.

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,080
As a student, it's easy to take for granted the definitions handed down to you, but the

210
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,160
more puzzles you solve where the insight involves an invariant, the more you come to appreciate

211
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,920
that each one of these definitions was once a clever discovery.

212
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,720
Terence Tao, one of the greatest modern mathematicians and the world's youngest IMO medalist, wrote

213
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
that,

214
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,600
"...mathematical problems or puzzles are important to real mathematics, like solving real-life

215
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,480
problems, just as fables, stories, and anecdotes are important to the young in understanding

216
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
real life."

217
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,120
Sure, these kinds of puzzles are contrived, but they carry lessons relevant to useful

218
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,480
problems you may actually need to solve one day.

219
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,040
Maybe it seems silly to liken this windmill puzzle to a fairy tale, a mathematical Aesop

220
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,840
summarizing that the moral of the story is to seek quantities which stay constant.

221
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,960
But some of you watching this will one day face a problem where finding an invariant

222
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,900
reveals a slick solution, and you might even look like a genius for doing so.

223
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,740
If a made-up windmill prepares you for a real problem, who cares that it's a fiction?
