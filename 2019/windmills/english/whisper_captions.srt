00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,580
Every year, more than 100 countries send six of their brightest teenagers, or the occasional

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,360
prepubescent prodigy, to represent them at the International Math Olympiad, commonly

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,780
known as the IMO.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,640
Considering that each country has its own elaborate system of contests leading to their

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,400
choice of six representatives, the IMO stands as the culminating symbol for the surprisingly

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,100
expansive and wonderful world that is contest math.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,680
The contest itself is essentially a test, split over two days, with three questions

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,880
given over four and a half hours each day.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,820
The questions are all proofs, meaning you don't simply find some numerical answer,

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,580
you have to discover and articulate a rigorous line of reasoning to answer each difficult

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,080
question, and then each one is scored on a scale from 0 up to 7.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,060
Of interest to you and me today is the one from 2011, with 563 total participants representing

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,380
101 countries.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,320
I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes, those do all happen to be prime numbers.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,380
But that's not why this test was interesting.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,020
Out of all these prime problem solvers, only one of them, Lisa Sauermann from Germany,

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,200
got a perfect score.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,700
And the only thing standing between the next two runners up that year and a perfect score

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,280
was problem number two.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,820
And this problem is beautiful, and despite evading many of the world's best mathematicians

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,340
of their age, the solution is something that anyone watching this video can understand.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,640
So let's begin by reading through it carefully.

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,460
Let S be a finite set of at least two points on the plane.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,680
Okay, so as you read the question it's often helpful to start drawing an example for yourself.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,020
Assume that no three points of S are collinear, in other words you never have three points

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,520
lining up, so you can probably predict that the problem's going to involve drawing lines

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
in some way that three points on one line would mess things up.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,020
A windmill is a process that starts with the line L going through a single point P in S.

29
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,580
The line rotates clockwise around the pivot P until the first time that that line meets

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,960
some other point belonging to S. And again, while reading it's helpful to draw out an

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,360
example so we've got this line that's pivoting around some point until it hits another.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,680
This point, Q, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about Q

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,120
until it next meets a point of S. This process continues indefinitely.

34
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,420
Alright, that's kind of fun.

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,260
We keep rotating and changing the pivot, and you can see why they call it a windmill process,

36
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,340
and you can also see why they specified that no three points lie on one line.

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,740
You wouldn't want to run into the ambiguity where you don't know which pivot to switch to.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Okay, so with all this setup, what's the question?

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,780
Show that we can choose a point P in S and a line L going through P such that the resulting

40
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,280
windmill uses each point of S as a pivot infinitely many times.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,680
Alright, depending on your tolerance of puzzles for puzzle's sake, you might wonder why

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,200
would anyone care about such a question?

43
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,340
There's a very good reason, in fact.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,700
I would argue that the act of solving this will make you better at math and related fields,

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,140
and I'll explain why once you've seen the solution.

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,540
But certainly on the surface, it feels disconnected from other parts of math.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,940
I mean, you look at other Olympiad problems, and they often involve some function to analyze,

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,960
or a numerical pattern to deduce, maybe a difficult counting setup or an elaborate geometric

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,600
construction.

50
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,600
But problem two, it's an unusually pure puzzle, and in some ways that's its charm.

51
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,500
Proving that some initial condition will result in this windmill hitting all the points infinitely

52
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,100
many times, well that doesn't test your knowledge of a particular theorem.

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,080
It tests if you can find a clever perspective.

54
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,480
But that blade cuts both ways.

55
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,180
Without resting on an existing result from math, what could possibly prepare someone

56
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,760
to study for something like this?

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,780
And in fact, that brings us to the second unusual thing about this problem.

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Based on the results, I'm guessing that it turned out to be much harder than the contest

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,380
organizers expected.

60
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,420
You see, typically the three problems each day are supposed to get progressively harder.

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,420
They're all hard, of course, it's the IMO, but problems one and four should be doable.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,840
Problems two and five, they're challenging.

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,840
And problems three and six, well they can be brutal.

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,500
But take a look at how many of our 563 participants that year got perfect scores on each of the

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,000
problems.

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Only 22 of them got full marks for question number two.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,500
By contrast, 170 got a perfect score on problem five, which is supposed to be about the same

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,960
difficulty, and more than twice as many got a perfect score for problem three, which is

69
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,820
supposed to be harder.

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,720
Some of you might notice that only six students got full points for problem six that year,

71
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,660
so by some measure that was the hardest problem on the test.

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,800
In fact, the way I introduced things earlier was a little disingenuous, the full data would

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,860
suggest that problem six was the real clincher.

74
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,700
But what's strange is that if you look at the results of those six students who solved

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,300
this hardest problem, all of whom are clearly phenomenal world-class problem solvers, this

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,280
windmill puzzle evaded five out of six of them.

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,100
But again, this problem is not hard because of the background knowledge it demands, it

78
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,400
asks only for insight.

79
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,240
So how do you approach something like this?

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,900
The first step with any puzzle is to simply play around with it and get a feel for it,

81
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,000
and it's always good to start simple and slowly get more complicated from there.

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,920
The simplest case would be two points, where the line trades off between each point.

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,300
That works well enough.

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,580
Adding a third point, it's pretty clear that the line will just rotate around them.

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,620
It might not be entirely clear how you would phrase this as a rigorous proof yet, but right

86
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,300
now we're just getting a feel for things.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,660
The fourth point is where it gets interesting.

88
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,960
In some places, your windmill will go around the four points just like it did with the

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,640
triangle, but if we put it inside that triangle, it looks like our windmill never hits it.

90
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,040
Looking back at the problem, it's asking you to show that for some starting position

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,120
of the line, not any position, the process will hit all the points infinitely many times.

92
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,800
So for an example like this, if you start with the line going through that troublesome

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
middle point, what happens?

94
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,020
Again, we're just playing around, perhaps moving your pencil among dots you've drawn

95
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,120
on a piece of scratch paper.

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,980
You want to believe a result before you try too hard to prove it.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,000
Here you'd see that your windmill does indeed bounce off of all the points as it goes through

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
a cycle, and it ends up back where it started.

99
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,940
The worry you might have is that in some large sets of points, where some are kind of inside

100
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,740
the others, you might be able to start off on the inside, but maybe something about this

101
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,540
windmill process takes the line to the outside, where as time goes on to infinity it'll

102
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,320
be blocked off from those inner points.

103
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,840
If you play around, and mind you it can take some time to draw out many examples and think

104
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,580
this through, you would notice that when the line starts off passing through the middle

105
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,880
of the points, it tends to stay there.

106
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,620
It never seems to venture off to the outside.

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,160
But can you guarantee that this will always happen?

108
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Or rather, can you first make this idea of starting in the middle a little more rigorous,

109
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,640
and from there prove that all the points will be hit infinitely many times?

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,120
As a general problem-solving tip, whenever you have a vague idea that feels productive,

111
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,300
you should of course find a way to be more exact about what you're saying, but preferably

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,620
put numbers to it, and then see if you can ask questions about those numbers.

113
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,200
In our example, one way to formalize this idea of a middle is to count how many points

114
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,620
are on either side of the line.

115
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,100
If you give the line some orientation, you can reasonably talk about a left half, say

116
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,280
coloring all the points on the left blue, and a right half, say coloring all the points

117
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
on the right brown.

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,740
And what it means for a line to be in the middle is that there are as many blue points

119
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,200
as there are brown points.

120
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,780
For the moment, let's say that the total number of points is an odd number, and the

121
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,340
point that the line passes through is colored white, sort of a neutral color.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,460
So for example, if there were 11 points, you would have 5 blue ones on the left, 5 brown

123
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,100
ones on the right, and the single white point as the pivot.

124
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,300
The case with an even number of points will be similar, just slightly less symmetric.

125
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,380
What this gives us is a new question to ask.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,300
What happens to the number of blue points and brown points as the process plays out?

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,900
In the example on screen now, you might notice it's always 5 and 5, never changing.

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,340
Playing around with other examples, you would find that the same is true.

129
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,420
Take a moment to pause right now, and see if you can think through why exactly that

130
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,840
would happen.

131
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,800
Why would these numbers not change?

132
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,840
Well, the key is to think through what happens as the line changes its pivot.

133
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,580
Having given the line an orientation, we can talk reasonably about which half is above

134
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,560
the pivot, and which one is below.

135
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,540
If the line hits a blue point on its left, it must happen below the pivot.

136
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,660
So then when it changes the pivot and continues rotating clockwise a bit, that old pivot,

137
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,520
now above the new one, ends up to the left, meaning it ends up in the blue region.

138
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,180
And entirely symmetrically, when it hits a brown point, it happens above the pivot, meaning

139
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,420
that the old pivot ends up in the brown region.

140
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,180
So no matter what, the number of points on a given side of the line cannot change, except

141
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,260
for the instances where the line is passing through two points at once.

142
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,680
When you lose a blue point, you gain a new one.

143
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,020
When you lose a brown point, you gain a new one.

144
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,760
And that is our key insight number one.

145
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,560
So why would this imply that the line must hit every point infinitely many times, no

146
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,940
matter what weird set of points you could dream up?

147
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,760
The second key is to think about letting this process go until the line has turned 180 degrees

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,280
around.

149
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,040
What that means is that it's parallel to the starting position, and because it has

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,580
to remain the case that half the points are on one side and half the points are on the

151
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,860
other, it must be passing through the same point it started on.

152
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,960
I mean, think about it, if it ended up on some other point, it would change the number

153
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,120
on a given side.

154
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,720
Additionally, since the line has rotated halfway around, everything that was blue has become

155
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,800
brown, and everything which was brown has become blue, and the only way to change the

156
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,900
color is if you get hit by the line.

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,140
So for our odd-numbered case, that means that after a half rotation, the line is back where

158
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,500
it started, and it's hit all of the other points.

159
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,500
So as time goes forward, it repeats this exact set of motions over and over, hitting all

160
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,740
of those points infinitely many times.

161
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,460
For the case with an even number of points, we need to alter the scheme slightly, but

162
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,360
only slightly.

163
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,340
To make it so that the number of blues can equal the number of browns, let's say that

164
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,240
the pivot counts now as a brown point.

165
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,300
So to define our initial condition, we still say for a given angle of the line, select

166
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,460
an initial point so that half of the points are blue, all on the left, and half of them

167
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,280
are brown, now either meaning they're on the right, or the pivot.

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,620
The same argument from before implies that after a 180° turn, everything has swapped

169
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,400
colors, but this time the line will be passing through a different point after that first

170
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,560
half turn, specifically one that used to be blue, but after another 180° it has to be

171
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,220
passing through the one that it started on.

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,020
Again, the logic is that it's parallel to its starting position, and if it was passing

173
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,120
through any other point, the number of points on a given side would have to be different.

174
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,620
So once more, we have a cycle which hits all of the points, and which ends in the same

175
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,600
position where it started.

176
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,040
This time it takes 360°, but that doesn't matter, as the cycle continues it'll hit

177
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,200
all the points infinitely many times.

178
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,620
Stepping back, there are two important lessons to take away from this puzzle, the first one

179
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,300
social and the second one mathematical.

180
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,620
Once you know this solution, and if you ponder it a bit and turn it around in your head a

181
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,300
couple times, it's very easy to fool yourself into thinking that the problem is easier than

182
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,920
it is.

183
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,100
After all, of course the number of points on a given side stays constant, right?

184
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,900
Of course that's a question you would ask.

185
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,960
And of course when you start in the middle, every point will switch sides after a half

186
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,360
a turn.

187
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,920
But the advantage of this problem coming from the IMO is that we don't have to rest on

188
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,180
In the subject of statements, we have the data to show it's a genuinely hard problem,

189
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,900
in that it evaded many of the world's best students who are demonstrably able to solve

190
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,700
hard problems.

191
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,960
In math, it's extremely hard to empathize with what it feels like to not understand

192
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,480
something.

193
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,860
I was discussing this video with a former coworker of mine from Khan Academy, who worked

194
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,740
a lot with people creating math exercises, and he pointed out that across a wide variety

195
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
of contributors, there's one constant.

196
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,540
Nobody is able to tell how difficult their exercises are.

197
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,400
Knowing when math is hard is way harder than the math itself.

198
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,160
This is important to keep in mind when teaching, but it's equally important to keep in mind

199
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,140
when being taught.

200
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,500
On our windmill puzzle, even if counting the number of points on one side seems obvious

201
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,020
in hindsight, you have to ask, given the vast space of possible things you might consider,

202
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,560
Why would anyone's mind turn to that particular idea?

203
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,800
This brings us to the mathematical takeaway.

204
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,500
What ultimately led to the solution was finding something about the complex system which stays

205
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,860
constant during this chaotic unfolding.

206
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,080
This is a ubiquitous theme through math, and especially through physics.

207
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,580
We're finding what's called an invariant.

208
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,220
Topologists do this when they count the number of holes in a surface.

209
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,360
Physicists do this when they define the ideas of energy and momentum, or in special relativity

210
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,160
when they define more abstract ideas like proper time.

211
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,120
As a student, it's easy to take for granted the definitions handed down to you, but the

212
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,940
more puzzles you solve where the insight involves an invariant, the more you come to appreciate

213
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,280
that each one of these definitions was once a clever discovery.

214
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,500
Terence Tao, one of the greatest modern mathematicians and the world's youngest IMO medalist, wrote

215
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,200
that mathematical problems or puzzles are important to real mathematics, like solving

216
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,960
real-life problems, just as fables, stories, and anecdotes are important to the young in

217
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,220
understanding real life.

218
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,160
Sure, these kinds of puzzles are contrived, but they carry lessons relevant to useful

219
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,660
problems you may actually need to solve one day.

220
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,100
Maybe it seems silly to liken this windmill puzzle to a fairy tale, a mathematical Aesop

221
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,980
summarizing that the moral of the story is to seek quantities which stay constant.

222
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,980
But some of you watching this will one day face a problem where finding an invariant

223
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,080
reveals a slick solution, and you might even look like a genius for doing so.

224
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,740
If a made-up windmill prepares you for a real problem, who cares that it's a fiction?
