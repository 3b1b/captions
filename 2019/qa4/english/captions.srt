1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Who's your favorite mathematician?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,952
I always find favorite questions kind of silly, 

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:10,120
but I will tell you about two different mathematicians that have been on my mind lately.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,970
So, a month or two ago I watched this documentary about Claude Shannon 

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,298
called The Bit Player, and then that prompted me to read a little bit more 

6
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:20,760
about Shannon in books like The Idea Factory or James Glick's The Information.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,320
And this guy was super interesting.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,840
I almost think of him as kind of a mixture between Donald Knuth and Adam Savage.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,200
So on the one hand, you know, he's the father of information theory.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,130
He wrote this absolutely seminal, super important paper about transmitting 

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,860
information and storing it and encoding it and things like that.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,286
It really gave birth to the information age and 

13
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:46,420
a lot of the foundations for computer science.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,798
To give you some indication of just how important this work was, 

15
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,956
there's this one science fiction novel where all of the years, 

16
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:54,460
instead of being measured B.C.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,020
and A.D.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,680
with respect to the birth of Christ, everything is before Shannon or after Shannon.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,133
It's viewed where the foundation of information theory is so pivotal in any kind 

20
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:08,380
of civilization that it's worth setting your entire timeline around that point.

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,940
So that's Shannon.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,480
Super influential on that one hand.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,648
But on the other hand, he was incredibly playful and very 

24
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:19,400
willing to kind of pour his life into totally useless toys.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,520
So he spent a lot of time building different kinds of unicycles.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,380
He built this flaming trumpet for his son.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,251
He, you know, built this automatic juggling machine, 

28
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:33,940
this mechanical calculator that would do computations in Roman numerals.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,720
Just wholly, completely useless things done for the purpose of play and nothing else.

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,809
What I think you have to wonder is if this playfulness is wholly 

31
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:47,340
incidental and unrelated to the important work that he did.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,740
Or if there's something that's necessary about it, right?

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,233
If it's required that the kind of personality who's coming up with something totally new, 

34
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,763
like original enough that it is a foundational moment for a new kind of science, 

35
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:05,517
almost has to be the kind of personality that's also willing to make gizmos and toys 

36
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:10,160
for his own pleasure that other people look at and see as useless, if somewhat fun.

37
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,561
Another mathematician I've been thinking about for kind of related reasons is Edward 

38
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:20,420
Lorenz, who is maybe not the father of chaos theory, but certainly one of the fathers.

39
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,860
And he wasn't even a mathematician, actually.

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,920
He was a meteorologist.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,008
But really, he was a mathematician to his core, 

42
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:29,780
but wearing the external veneer of a meteorologist.

43
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,100
And he's maybe most famous for this system of equations.

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,380
It's just three variables, three unknowns.

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
It's one of the earliest examples of something called a strange attractor.

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,940
But it came about when he was studying weather patterns, right?

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,900
And weather is famously hard to understand.

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,500
You know, at the extreme, there's a huge number of unknown variables.

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,212
If you go all the way to one extreme, you could say that 

50
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,780
every atom in the atmosphere has six degrees of freedom.

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,841
So you could have this truly ungodly monstrous system 

52
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:01,520
of equations that no one could ever hope to analyze.

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,040
So inevitably, you have to do something to simplify things down for pragmatism's sake.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,327
And a lot of people, I think, thought that the reason weather is 

55
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:13,520
hard to predict is simply because of the number of variables at play.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,284
And one of the important contributions from Lorenz was to be able to simplify down 

57
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:22,498
the unpredictability of it into a surprisingly simple set of equations to say, hey, 

58
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:26,261
some of the facts here that are hard to predict when you make a, you know, 

59
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:30,124
when you make some kind of measurement with a little bit of error around it, 

60
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:34,438
and that error kind of propagates, that's not just because of the number of variables 

61
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:34,840
at play.

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,380
You can have that kind of chaos arising from surprisingly simple circumstances.

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,408
So in order to do this, right, you have to have the strange mixture, again, 

64
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:48,320
of a kind of pragmatism with a kind of more pure mathematician instinct.

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
And I wonder if this is ever something that a pure mathematician could have done.

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,087
If he wasn't grounded in a problem like weather, 

67
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:58,048
where he was doing all of these computational models, 

68
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:02,600
and really just in the weeds of, you know, convection or whatever else it might be.

69
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,657
So in the same way that Shannon kind of represents this contrast 

70
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:09,225
between playfulness and pragmatism, in my mind, 

71
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:14,040
Lorenz sort of represents this contrast between, like, applied science and then pure math.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,831
And just as Shannon is the father of information theory, 

73
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:20,651
it doesn't seem like a coincidence that we find in the father of another very 

74
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,296
instrumental science to our modern age, chaos theory, 

75
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,500
this sort of middle ground between those two.

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,219
Now obviously there's a lot of selection bias at play here, right, 

77
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:32,644
like most people that find themselves somewhere between pure and applied or 

78
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:36,700
somewhere between pragmatic and playful don't give rise to completely new fields of study.

79
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,612
But I do have to wonder if the novelty required to father a new field 

80
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:44,580
necessitates breaking the norm and not falling into one clear-cut path.

81
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,223
Some of you might be wondering if every question in this Q&A will have me 

82
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:56,203
pontificating for many minutes, but I do have a broader point here, 

83
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:59,008
which is that I think a number of people watching this channel, 

84
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,164
especially those on the younger end, are clearly into pure math, right, 

85
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:03,260
they're curious about it.

86
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,320
I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them are contemplating becoming mathematicians.

87
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,540
And for that set of people, I kind of want to put out 

88
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,040
the question of where do you think there's more value?

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,815
Do you think it's if all of these people with this inclination towards 

90
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:20,030
pure math go into that field, and that's where they get to collaborate 

91
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,837
with a lot of folks who are like-minded, who think like them, 

92
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:26,460
they resonate on the same wavelength, maybe they amplify each other's strengths?

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,853
Or is there more value if each one of them kind of gets dispersed into some completely 

94
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:36,236
different field, and each one is not so much a mathematician as a mathematician plus X, 

95
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,720
right, they're a mathematician plus a builder plus a meteorologist plus whatever have you.

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,801
And they take those instincts of playfulness towards puzzles or desire to abstract 

97
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:50,256
the simplest form of a specific kind of hardness and basically bring that mathematician 

98
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:54,560
instinct to something totally different, right, which of those worlds has more value?

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,320
A teenage kid walks up to you and says they hate math.

100
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,000
What do you tell or show them?

101
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,550
I get the impression that the spirit of this question is for me to answer 

102
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,986
with some piece of math that's so enticing that even the most ardent of 

103
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:13,660
math haters would have to bring about some kind of affection for the subject.

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,034
But the thing is, if someone comes to you and they admit that they don't like math, 

105
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:21,322
or that they hate math, I don't think you should show them a piece of math, 

106
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:22,880
even if you do want to convert them.

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,545
It's a little bit like if, let's say you really love coffee, right, 

108
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:29,291
and someone comes to you and they say, I just hate coffee, 

109
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,735
but you like it a lot and you're kind of this snob and you really want to 

110
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:33,620
turn them on to it.

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,691
The way to do it is not to try to find the world's best cup of coffee and 

112
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:41,360
then give it to them, because no matter what, it's going to taste like dirt.

113
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,100
They don't like it.

114
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
They're not addicted to it at this point.

115
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,320
Instead, if you want to turn someone on to it, we have a couple options.

116
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,060
One of them can be to first breed necessity, and then from there maybe get an addiction.

117
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,903
So let's say it's a student and they need to stay up all night to 

118
00:06:57,903 --> 00:07:01,591
finish some kind of paper, and so they begrudgingly have to take some caffeine, 

119
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:04,496
and after that a kind of culinary Stockholm syndrome kicks in, 

120
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:07,540
and through the addiction they come to kind of like the substance.

121
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
That's not the greatest, but that's a way to do it.

122
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,077
The analog with the world of math might be trying to find something where 

123
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:20,700
math is the drug necessary for someone to accomplish what they want to.

124
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,609
You know, maybe they're really into video games, 

125
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,886
so they want to make their own video game, and often in writing 

126
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:31,240
the software for that you have to use geometry, trigonometry, maybe bits of calculus.

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,380
It kind of depends on the game that you're building.

128
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,980
So you breed the necessity.

129
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,494
But in either case, I think the key is to just try to build up familiarity, 

130
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,526
just be exposed to math in a lot of different contexts, 

131
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:46,100
and importantly for it to not ever be traumatic when that happens.

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,859
I think the reason a lot of people say that they hate math is because 

133
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:53,480
their only exposure to it is tightly linked with a sense of failure, right?

134
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,432
It's a hard subject, but importantly it's a very cumulative subject, 

135
00:07:56,432 --> 00:08:00,147
so if you miss one little part, it looks like you're failing in all of the later parts, 

136
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,820
even if you would have been really good at those other parts without that missing link.

137
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,033
So instead if the math comes about in a less judgmental context, 

138
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:11,032
something where there's no grading, you know, maybe it's just playing with puzzles with 

139
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,031
friends, or it's writing that bit of software for the video game, 

140
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:17,166
or whatever it is where you're gaining exposure without that trauma, 

141
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,120
I think after enough time, you're just going to like the subject.

142
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,104
Because I think if we're all really honest with ourselves, 

143
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:25,794
and we look back on why we like the things that we like, 

144
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:28,060
it's often because someone in our life liked it.

145
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,449
The time we were spending with them brought us to spending time with that thing, 

146
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:34,059
and then it just stuck with us.

147
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,961
What advice would you give to a math enthusiast suffering from anxiety disorder, 

148
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:40,480
clinical depression, and ADHD?

149
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:45,754
I'm not entirely sure how the word math enthusiast in the question changes the answer, 

150
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:50,218
but I will say that for anything health related, and this goes double from mental health, 

151
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:53,640
definitely seek professional help earlier than you think you need to.

152
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,400
So don't be shy about finding a therapist or asking 

153
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
your doctor about these kinds of things.

154
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,058
One thing I will say, as a professional YouTuber, 

155
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:06,260
I do think it's probably healthy for people to spend less time on the internet.

156
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,113
You know, I always get this uneasy feeling if I hear about 

157
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:12,160
someone binge watching all of my videos or something like that.

158
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,802
Because on the one hand, I often do measure success in 

159
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,240
terms of how much time people are watching the videos.

160
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,079
It's some indication of how much it's reaching the world, 

161
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,500
how deeply people want to engage with it, and all of that.

162
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,416
But on the other hand, if I think of someone kind of staying up all night to 

163
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:30,332
watch YouTube, or even just sitting in their house all day to watch YouTube, 

164
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:34,351
no matter what that video is, no matter how enlightening or how educational it 

165
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:38,725
seems to be, that's gotta be bad for you and unhealthy in comparison to occasionally, 

166
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:42,387
you know, going outside or spending time with real people in the world, 

167
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:46,660
or if you want to engage with math, doing it in a more physical, social kind of way.

168
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,400
Is Ben Ben and Blue still a thing?

169
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,880
Ah, yes, the podcast with the Bens.

170
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
No, I don't think it'll continue.

171
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
I don't think that's a bad thing.

172
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,820
I think we had some really good conversations about education in there.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm not sure how much we necessarily had to say.

174
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,360
And I don't think all projects should live forever.

175
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,416
I think there's something kind of nice about doing something a little different, 

176
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:12,497
a little experimental, and then being willing to just walk away from it if it seems 

177
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:16,822
better to spend time on, say, animated math videos or whatever else your main occupation 

178
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:17,260
might be.

179
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,640
Favorite podcasts?

180
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,276
Alright, so there's three different podcasts where I 

181
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,640
get actively excited if I see something new in the feed.

182
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,120
And it's unfortunate because each one doesn't upload super regularly.

183
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,920
First one is The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green.

184
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,420
So, as many of you probably know, John Green is an excellent writer.

185
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,117
The podcast itself, he kind of reviews everyday things or aspects of human existence that 

186
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:48,020
range from deeply philosophical ones to very mundane, like the Taco Bell breakfast menu.

187
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,026
It's maybe 70% personal memoir, and you get this view into 

188
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:57,480
his own very thoughtful but also very twisted and tortured mind.

189
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,220
So, highly recommended.

190
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,477
The second, which I think is super popular, so certainly don't need me saying this, 

191
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:06,420
is Hardcore History by Dan Carlin.

192
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,147
He often likes to go deep into the human experience of certain wars or 

193
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:16,340
certain very violent times in human history that shaped the direction of things.

194
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,918
And he does a good job just giving a super abundant amount of context, 

195
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:23,245
maybe way too much context, which is why these podcasts sometimes 

196
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:26,320
last as long as six hours and will be many, many part series.

197
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,220
But sometimes you like that in a podcast.

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,526
And then maybe foremost, that I like a lot, and this will just come as no surprise, 

199
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,840
is the Numberphile podcast.

200
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,478
I'm slightly biased because I was on it, but I 

201
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,800
actually think I'm the least interesting guest there.

202
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,795
Super interesting to hear from different mathematicians what their story is, 

203
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,546
how they relate to the subject, what motivates them, 

204
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:48,400
and of course Brady Haran is a phenomenal interviewer, 

205
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,500
so it's just perfect for anyone who's into math, even in the slightest of ways.

206
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,844
If you had both the responsibility and opportunity to best introduce the world of 

207
00:11:56,844 --> 00:12:01,454
mathematics to curious and intelligent minds before they are shaped by the antiquated, 

208
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,640
disempowering, and demotivational education system of today, what would you do?

209
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,700
Asking because I will soon be a father.

210
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,870
First of all, let's just acknowledge that it's very weird for me to 

211
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,587
be asked a question that has anything with the flavor of parenting advice, 

212
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,760
because, well, look at me, like I'm 27, what the hell do I know?

213
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,450
But one interesting place to look here, if we're thinking, 

214
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,378
how do you make a child entering the world love math, or things related to math, 

215
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,900
is Richard Feynman's dad.

216
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,343
So, evidently, Feynman's dad was incredibly interested in making him into, like, 

217
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:37,140
a physicist or an engineer or something like that, 

218
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,047
and even when young Richard was just a newborn baby, 

219
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:44,710
he would paint these interesting patterns that were meant to instill young Richard's 

220
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,440
mind with a sense of mathematical patterns through the raw exposure.

221
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,128
And as he grew up a little bit later, he would give these very deep, 

222
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:55,731
thoughtful answers to questions about how the world worked, or why when you, 

223
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:58,820
like, tug at a wagon that has a ball in it, the ball doesn't move.

224
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,000
Feynman would tell all of these stories, they were some of his favorites to tell.

225
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,593
You know, if I look back at my own childhood, there's definitely a lot 

226
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:08,880
of influence from a very attentive, thoughtful father in that respect.

227
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,200
I think I said this in a previous Q&A, but I'll just say it again here.

228
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,966
I remember these games where he would stack these sugar cubes in interesting 

229
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,120
geometric arrangements, and I would be asked to count how many there are.

230
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,716
And you couldn't just straight up count because it was, 

231
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:23,900
some of them were hidden in certain ways, right, 

232
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,620
so you are effectively cubing numbers or something like that.

233
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,664
And, of course, if I got it right, then I would 

234
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,880
get one of the sugar cubes as this Pavlovian reward.

235
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,002
And if you look at the success of someone like Feynman when it comes to problem solving, 

236
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:39,385
and I definitely don't view myself as, like, a great problem solver, 

237
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,660
but I do love the subject.

238
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,578
I have this, like, deep-seated affection for it that probably is 

239
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,280
not unassociated to the kind of games my dad would play with me.

240
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,237
It's not so much that I think, oh, the painting of those patterns really did 

241
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:54,620
instill young Richard's mind with a sense of math, 

242
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,404
or that the answers that his father gave to certain questions were the ones that 

243
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,040
made him deep and thoughtful later.

244
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,242
I think it's just that when you're a parent and you're showing 

245
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,394
a lot of attention towards something, you're signaling to the 

246
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:09,800
kid that that something is important and it's worth thinking about.

247
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,441
So all of the signaling that probably came from young Richard Feynman's dad showing 

248
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,487
this deep attentiveness to questions about the physical world, 

249
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:21,451
about mathematical patterns, probably made it such that young Richard would spend 

250
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,917
a lot of his own time thinking about those things, 

251
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,480
because they just pattern match off of their parents.

252
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,588
Another thing I might say is try to draw a distinction between school math and math, 

253
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:33,020
right?

254
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,920
They can just be very separate things, and kind 

255
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,280
of separating the brand of those two can't hurt.

256
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,873
Well, just last week, all of the internet has been very abuzz about a 

257
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:51,206
certain result that came from these three physicists studying neutrinos 

258
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:55,480
about eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which is a crazy fundamental thing.

259
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,663
You kind of wouldn't imagine that there are any new things to be discovered 

260
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:03,626
about computing eigenvectors or computing eigenvalues, because it's so, 

261
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:07,700
well, it's kind of old and it's very, I don't know, routine at this point.

262
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,943
But they found what they thought was a result and they sent it to Terry Tao, 

263
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:15,313
who actually responded and his initial thought was, this can't be true, 

264
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,420
it would be in every textbook if it was true.

265
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,082
And then within two hours, I think he found three independent proofs of the thing, 

266
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:27,082
and yeah, it's just a different way to compute eigenvectors that was discovered in 2019, 

267
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:31,240
even though that totally could have been discovered hundreds of years ago.

268
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,680
Can we fix math on Wikipedia?

269
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,060
Really serious here.

270
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,885
I constantly go there after your vids for a bit of a deeper dive and learn nothing more, 

271
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:40,140
ever.

272
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,640
Compared to almost any other topic in the natural sciences or physics, 

273
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,140
where at least I get an outline of where to go next, it's such a shame.

274
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,137
So this question kind of reminds me of that classic trope where you've 

275
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:55,815
got a girl and she's dating a boy and, you know, he's kind of a bad boy, 

276
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:59,039
he does a couple things that are wrong that adds to his allure, 

277
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,020
he's kind of sexy in that way, but she's thinking, oh, I can change him, right?

278
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,760
He's flawed, but I can fix him.

279
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,060
And everyone in her life is looking and saying, oh, honey, like, he's not going to change.

280
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,920
People don't change.

281
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,180
You have to find someone else.

282
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,165
In the same way, if I see someone trying to learn math from Wikipedia 

283
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,540
and not use it as a reference, it's like, it's not going to change.

284
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,740
Don't try to change it.

285
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,100
You've got to find a different source.

286
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,437
There's lots of really great blogs that you can go to, 

287
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:27,914
or Math Exchange and Quora are great in terms of people trying to 

288
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:32,340
explain things in approachable ways, and don't forget about just good old textbooks.

289
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,343
In math, more so than a lot of fields, I think there's a strong contrast between 

290
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:40,100
what makes good reference material and what makes good pedagogical material.

291
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,790
And a general rule of thumb, this is not universal, but general rule of thumb, 

292
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,520
things that are single-authored, I believe, are better pedagogically.

293
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,968
And I suspect the reason for this is that when you want to explain a topic, 

294
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:57,476
often the best route to making it understandable is to start off by being a little 

295
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,020
bit wrong.

296
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,310
You explain kind of a simplified version of something that isn't entirely accurate, 

297
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,200
but it's easier to get a foothold in.

298
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,503
Then once you have that foothold, you slowly carve away what's wrong about 

299
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:12,180
it until you end up at what is entirely accurate, but more complicated.

300
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,839
But you've taken this path through incorrectness.

301
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,983
Now when you have multiple authors, I think the tendency is that 

302
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:22,480
you sort of wipe away and edit away the things that are incorrect.

303
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,619
That's like the stable equilibrium that you reach.

304
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,474
So what you're left with is a source that's entirely factually correct, 

305
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,960
but it's harder to get a foothold into for that reason.

306
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,631
And Wikipedia just represents the extreme of this, 

307
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:36,752
but I also think you see it if you look at a textbook that has, you know, 

308
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:37,680
three or four authors.

309
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Again, there are exceptions, but I like that as a rule of thumb.

310
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:48,080
Real quick, I want to tell you about two new items that have 

311
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,000
been added to the 3Blue1Brown store for any math enthusiasts.

312
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,745
The first one, in the spirit of upping the level of formality on things, 

313
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:57,480
is this knot theory themed tie.

314
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,100
So as you can see, the pattern includes a lot of different simple mathematical knots.

315
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,477
So almost any knot that you are likely to tie with your tie anyway is going to 

316
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:10,800
be topologically equivalent to one of these, unless you just go totally crazy.

317
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,408
In sourcing this, we wanted to make sure that it was, you know, 

318
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:17,840
a legitimately high quality tie, and I'm really happy with what we found.

319
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,771
Then as a supplement to the ties, I also got these vector field socks produced, 

320
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:26,056
and what they represent is the phase space of a pendulum, 

321
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:30,134
which some of you may know is most naturally represented on a cylinder, 

322
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:31,720
hence printing it on a sock.

323
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,320
So the whole item is just sort of a subtle nod to that fact.

324
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,994
I believe DFTBA is going to do some kind of sale on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, 

325
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,120
so if you're watching this before then, definitely check it out.

326
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,320
And with that, I will see you all in the next, probably much more typical, video.
