1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,989
The goal is for you to come away from this
video understanding one of the most important

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:07,570
formulas in probability, Bayes’ theorem.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,370
This formula is central to scientific discovery,
it’s a core tool in machine learning and

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,400
AI, and it’s even been used for treasure
hunting, when in the 80’s a small team led

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,980
by Tommy Thompson used Bayesian search tactics
to help uncover a ship that had sunk a century

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:33,620
and half earlier carrying what, in today’s
terms, amounts to $700,000,000 worth of gold.

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,430
But there’s more than one level of understanding.

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,730
There’s knowing what each part means, so
you can plug in numbers.

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,789
There’s understanding why it’s true; later
I’ll show you to a diagram that’s helpful

10
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,149
for rediscovering the formula on the fly as
needed.

11
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,239
Then there’s being able to recognize when
you need to use it.

12
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,679
With the goal of gaining a deeper understanding,
you and I will tackle these in reverse order.

13
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,120
So before dissecting the formula, or explaining
the visual that makes it obvious, I’d like

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,890
to tell you about a man named Steve. Listen
carefully.

15
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,090
Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably
helpful but with very little interest in people

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,040
or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy
soul, he has a need for order and structure,

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
and a passion for detail.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,850
Which of the following do you find more likely:
“Steve is a librarian”, or “Steve is

19
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,460
a farmer”?

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,660
Some of you may recognize this as an example
from a study conducted by the psychologists

21
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:43,860
Daniel Kahneman and Emos Tversky, whose Nobel-prize-winning
work was popularized in books like “Thinking

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,720
Fast and Slow”, “The Undoing Project”,
and several others. They researched human

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,430
judgments, with a frequent focus on when these
judgments irrationally contradict what the

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,280
laws of probability suggest they should be.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,960
The example with Steve, the maybe-librarian-maybe-farmer,
illustrates one specific type of irrationality.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,850
Or maybe I should say “alleged” irrationality;
some people debate the conclusion, but more

27
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,300
on all that in a moment.

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,350
According to Kahneman and Tversky, after people
are given this description of Steve as “meek

29
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,250
and tidy soul”, most say he is more likely
to be a librarian than a farmer. After all,

30
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,560
these traits line up better with the stereotypical
view of a librarian than that of a farmer.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,730
And according to Kahneman and Tversky, this
is irrational.

32
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,730
The point is not whether people hold correct
or biased views about the personalities of

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,920
librarians or farmers, it’s that almost
no one thinks to incorporate information about

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,420
ratio of farmers to librarians into their
judgments. In their paper, Kahneman and Tversky

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,440
said that in the US that ratio is about 20
to 1. The numbers I can find for today put

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,020
it much higher than that, but let’s just
run with the 20 to 1 ratio since it’s a

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,690
bit easier to illustrate, and proves the point
just as well.

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,470
To be clear, anyone who is asked this question
doesn’t have perfect information on the

39
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,690
actual statistics of farmers, librarians,
and their personality traits. But the question

40
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,430
is whether people even think to consider this
ratio, enough to make a rough estimate. Rationality

41
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,010
is not about knowing facts, it’s about recognizing
which facts are relevant.

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,879
If you do think to make this estimate, there’s
a simple way to reason about the question

43
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,690
– which, spoiler alert, involves all the
essential reasoning behind Bayes’ theorem.

44
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,480
You might start by picturing a representative
sample of farmers and librarians, say, 200

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,040
farmers and 10 librarians. Then when you hear
the meek and tidy soul description, let’s

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,930
say your gut instinct is that 40% of librarians
would fit that description and that 10% of

47
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,960
farmers would. That would mean that from your
sample, you’d expect that about 4 librarians

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:55,310
fit it, and that 20 farmers do. The probability
that a random person who fits this description

49
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,420
is a librarian is 4/24, or 16.7%.

50
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,330
So even if you think a librarian is 4 times
as likely as a farmer to fit this description,

51
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,570
that’s not enough to overcome the fact that
there are way more farmers. The upshot, and

52
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,209
this is the key mantra underlying Bayes’
theorem, is that new evidence should not completely

53
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:21,319
determine your beliefs in a vacuum; it should
update prior beliefs.

54
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,199
If this line of reasoning makes sense to you,
the way seeing evidence restricts the space

55
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,150
of possibilities, then congratulations! You
understand the heart of Bayes’ theorem.

56
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,270
Maybe the numbers you’d estimate would be
different, but what matters is how you fit

57
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:45,410
the numbers together to update a belief based
on evidence. Here, see if you can take a minute

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:52,479
to generalize what we just did and write it
down as a formula.

59
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,750
The general situation where Bayes’ theorem
is relevant is when you have some hypothesis,

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,270
say that Steve is a librarian, and you see
some evidence, say this verbal description

61
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,460
of Steve as a “meek and tidy soul”, and
you want to know the probability that the

62
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,610
hypothesis holds given that the evidence is
true. In the standard notation, this vertical

63
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,789
bar means “given that”. As in, we’re
restricting our view only to the possibilities

64
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,770
where the evidence holds.

65
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,389
The first relevant number is the probability
that the hypothesis holds before considering

66
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,550
the new evidence. In our example, that was
the 1/21, which came from considering the

67
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,240
ratio of farmers to librarians in the general
population. This is known as the prior.

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,940
After that, we needed to consider the proportion
of librarians that fit this description; the

69
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,729
probability we would see the evidence given
that the hypothesis is true. Again, when you

70
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:53,439
see this vertical bar, it means we’re talking
about a proportion of a limited part of the

71
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,830
total space of possibilities, in this cass,
limited to the left slide where the hypothesis

72
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,789
holds. In the context of Bayes’ theorem,
this value also has a special name, it’s

73
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:04,789
the “likelihood”.

74
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:09,749
Similarly, we need to know how much of the
other side of our space includes the evidence;

75
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:15,180
the probability of seeing the evidence given
that our hypothesis isn’t true. This little

76
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,310
elbow symbol is commonly used to mean “not”
in probability.

77
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,749
Now remember what our final answer was. The
probability that our librarian hypothesis

78
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:31,960
is true given the evidence is the total number
of librarians fitting the evidence, 4, divided

79
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,870
by the total number of people fitting the
evidence, 24.

80
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,619
Where does that 4 come from? Well it’s the
total number of people, times the prior probability

81
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:46,830
of being a librarian, giving us the 10 total
librarians, times the probability that one

82
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,259
of those fits the evidence. That same number
shows up again in the denominator, but we

83
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,289
need to add in the total number of people
times the proportion who are not librarians,

84
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:03,199
times the proportion of those who fit the
evidence, which in our example gave 20.

85
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,869
The total number of people in our example,
210, gets canceled out – which of course

86
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:12,779
it should, that was just an arbitrary choice
we made for illustration – leaving us finally

87
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,430
with the more abstract representation purely
in terms of probabilities. This, my friends,

88
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,190
is Bayes’ theorem.

89
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:26,020
You often see this big denominator written
more simply as P(E), the total probability

90
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:34,699
of seeing the evidence. In practice, to calculate
it, you almost always have to break it down

91
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,919
into the case where the hypothesis is true,
and the one where it isn’t.

92
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:45,499
Piling on one final bit of jargon, this final
answer is called the “posterior”; it’s

93
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,479
your belief about the hypothesis after seeing
the evidence.

94
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,979
Writing it all out abstractly might seem more
complicated than just thinking through the

95
00:07:53,979 --> 00:08:00,139
example directly with a representative sample;
and yeah, it is! Keep in mind, though, the

96
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:06,050
value of a formula like this is that it lets
you quantify and systematize the idea of changing

97
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,419
beliefs. Scientists use this formula when
analyzing the extent to which new data validates

98
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:17,289
or invalidates their models; programmers use
it in building artificial intelligence, where

99
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:22,150
you sometimes want to explicitly and numerically
model a machine’s belief. And honestly just

100
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,879
for how you view yourself, your own opinions
and what it takes for your mind to change,

101
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,000
Bayes’ theorem can reframe how you think
about thought itself. Putting a formula to

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,099
it is also all the more important as the examples
get more intricate.

103
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,029
However you end up writing it, I’d actually
encourage you not to memorize the formula,

104
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,759
but to draw out this diagram as needed.

105
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,160
This is sort of the distilled version of thinking
with a representative sample where we think

106
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,319
with areas instead of counts, which is more
flexible and easier to sketch on the fly.

107
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:58,870
Rather than bringing to mind some specific
number of examples, think of the space of

108
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:06,649
all possibilities as a 1x1 square. Any event
occupies some subset of this space, and the

109
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:12,540
probability of that event can be thought about
as the area of that subset. For example, I

110
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,720
like to think of the hypothesis as filling
the left part of this square, with a width

111
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,900
of P(H).

112
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,000
I recognize I’m being a bit repetitive,
but when you see evidence, the space of possibilities

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,970
gets restricted. Crucially, that restriction
may not happen evenly between the left and

114
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,970
the right. So the new probability for the
hypothesis is the proportion it occupies in

115
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,360
this restricted subspace.

116
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,569
If you happen to think a farmer is just as
likely to fit the evidence as a librarian,

117
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:47,700
then the proportion doesn’t change, which
should make sense. Irrelevant evidence doesn’t

118
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,220
change your belief. But when these likelihoods
are very different, your belief changes a

119
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,620
lot.

120
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:19,699
This is actually a good time to step back
and consider a few broader takeaways about

121
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:24,960
how to make probability more intuitive, beyond
Bayes’ theorem. First off, there’s the

122
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,630
trick of thinking about a representative sample
with a specific number of examples, like our

123
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,180
210 librarians and farmers. There’s actually
another Kahneman and Tversky result to this

124
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,230
effect, which is interesting enough to interject
here.

125
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,730
They did an experiment similar to the one
with Steve, but where people were given the

126
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,730
following description of a fictitious woman
named Linda:

127
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,670
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken,
and very bright. She majored in philosophy.

128
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,910
As a student, she was deeply concerned with
issues of discrimination and social justice,

129
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,300
and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

130
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:07,290
They were then asked what is more likely:
That Linda is a bank teller, or that Linda

131
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,930
is a bank teller and is active in the feminist
movement. 85% of participants said the latter

132
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,000
is more likely, even though the set of bank
tellers active in the femist movement is a

133
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,709
subset of the set of bank tellers!

134
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:31,430
But, what’s fascinating is that there’s
a simple way to rephrase the question that

135
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,019
dropped this error from 85% to 0. Instead,
if participants are told there are 100 people

136
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,230
who fit this description, and asked people
to estimate how many of those 100 are bank

137
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,980
tellers, and how many are bank tellers who
are active in the feminist movement, no one

138
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,759
makes the error. Everyone correctly assigns
a higher number to the first option than to

139
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,629
the second.

140
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:00,810
Somehow a phrase like “40 out of 100”
kicks our intuition into gear more effectively

141
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:07,439
than “40%”, much less “0.4”, or abstractly
referencing the idea of something being more

142
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,519
or less likely.

143
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,079
That said, representative samples don’t
easily capture the continuous nature of probability,

144
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,970
so turning to area is a nice alternative,
not just because of the continuity, but also

145
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,209
because it’s way easier to sketch out while
you’re puzzling over some problem.

146
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:30,050
You see, people often think of probability
as being the study of uncertainty. While that

147
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,269
is, of course, how it’s applied in science,
the actual math of probability is really just

148
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:41,709
the math of proportions, where turning to
geometry is exceedingly helpful.

149
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:49,000
I mean, if you look at Bayes’ theorem as
a statement about proportions – proportions

150
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,670
of people, of areas, whatever – once you
digest what it’s saying, it’s actually

151
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,389
kind of obvious. Both sides tell you to look
at all the cases where the evidence is true,

152
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:05,490
and consider the proportion where the hypothesis
is also true. That’s it. That’s all it’s

153
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,740
saying.

154
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,880
What’s noteworthy is that such a straightforward
fact about proportions can become hugely significant

155
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,260
for science, AI, and any situation where you
want to quantify belief. You’ll get a better

156
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,860
glimpse of this as we get into more examples.

157
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,070
But before any more examples, we have some
unfinished business with Steve. Some psychologists

158
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,319
debate Kahneman and Tversky’s conclusion,
that the rational thing to do is to bring

159
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:38,310
to mind the ratio of farmers to librarians.
They complain that the context is ambiguous.

160
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,510
Who is Steve, exactly? Should you expect he’s
a randomly sampled American? Or would you

161
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,279
be better to assume he’s a friend of these
two psychologists interrogating you?

162
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,470
Or perhaps someone you’re personally likely
to know? This assumption determines the prior.

163
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,930
I, for one, run into many more librarians
in a given month than farmers. And needless

164
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,410
to say, the probability of a librarian or
a farmer fitting this description is highly

165
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,699
open to interpretation.

166
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:10,330
But for our purposes, understanding the math,
notice how any questions worth debating can

167
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,540
be pictured in the context of the diagram.
Questions of context shift around the prior,

168
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,259
and questions of personalities and stereotypes
shift the relevant likelihoods.

169
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,759
All that said, whether or not you buy this
particular experiment the ultimate point that

170
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,540
evidence should not determine beliefs, but
update them, is worth tattooing in your mind.

171
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,699
I’m in no position to say whether this does
or doesn’t run against natural human intuition,

172
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:41,579
we’ll leave that to the psychologists. What’s
more interesting to me is how we can reprogram

173
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,319
our intuitions to authentically reflect the
implications of math, and bringing to mind

174
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,399
the right image can often do just that.
