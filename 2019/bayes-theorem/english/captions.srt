1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,369
The goal is for you to come away from this video understanding one 

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:06,840
of the most important formulas in all of probability, Bayes' theorem.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,266
This formula is central to scientific discovery, 

4
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:14,930
it's a core tool in machine learning and AI, and it's even been used for treasure 

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,512
hunting, when in the 1980s a small team led by Tommy Thompson, 

6
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:23,062
and I'm not making up that name, used Bayesian search tactics to help uncover a 

7
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:25,849
ship that had sunk a century and a half earlier, 

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,740
and the ship was carrying what in today's terms amounts to $700 million worth of gold.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,264
So it's a formula worth understanding, but of course there 

10
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:37,040
are multiple different levels of possible understanding.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,660
At the simplest there's just knowing what each one of the parts means, 

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,040
so that you can plug in numbers.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,497
Then there's understanding why it's true, and later I'm going to show you a 

14
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:50,580
certain diagram that's helpful for rediscovering this formula on the fly as needed.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,540
But maybe the most important level is being able to recognize when you need to use it.

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,050
And with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding, 

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,560
you and I are going to tackle these in reverse order.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,774
So before dissecting the formula or explaining the visual that makes it obvious, 

19
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,860
I'd like to tell you about a man named Steve.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Listen carefully now.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,839
Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but 

22
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:19,160
with very little interest in people or the world of reality.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,100
A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,780
Which of the following do you find more likely?

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,380
Steve is a librarian, or Steve is a farmer?

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,180
Some of you may recognize this as an example from a study 

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,440
conducted by the two psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,488
Their work was a big deal, it won a Nobel Prize, 

29
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:44,458
and it's been popularized many times over in books like Kahneman's Thinking Fast and 

30
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,560
Slow, or Michael Lewis's The Undoing Project.

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,396
What they researched was human judgments, with a frequent focus on when these 

32
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:55,780
judgments irrationally contradict what the laws of probability suggest they should be.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,645
The example with Steve, our maybe-librarian-maybe-farmer, 

34
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,381
illustrates one specific type of irrationality, 

35
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:06,770
or maybe I should say alleged irrationality, there are people who debate the 

36
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,620
conclusion here, but more on all of that later on.

37
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,911
According to Kahneman and Tversky, after people are given this description 

38
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:18,000
of Steve as a meek and tidy soul, most say he's more likely to be a librarian.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,730
After all, these traits line up better with the 

40
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,460
stereotypical view of a librarian than a farmer.

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,880
And according to Kahneman and Tversky, this is irrational.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,501
The point is not whether people hold correct or biased views about the 

43
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:35,623
personalities of librarians and farmers, it's that almost nobody thinks to 

44
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:40,240
incorporate information about the ratio of farmers to librarians in their judgments.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,180
In their paper, Kahneman and Tversky said that in the US that ratio is about 20 to 1.

46
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,113
The numbers I could find today put that much higher, 

47
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:52,033
but let's stick with the 20 to 1 number, since it's a little easier to illustrate 

48
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,420
and proves the point as well.

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,330
To be clear, anyone who has asked this question is not expected to have perfect 

50
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,785
information about the actual statistics of farmers and librarians and their personality 

51
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:03,140
traits.

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,601
But the question is whether people even think to consider 

53
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:09,220
that ratio enough to at least make a rough estimate.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,460
Rationality is not about knowing facts, it's about recognizing which facts are relevant.

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,481
Now if you do think to make that estimate, there's a pretty 

56
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:21,212
simple way to reason about the question, which, spoiler alert, 

57
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,900
involves all of the essential reasoning behind Bayes' theorem.

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,123
You might start by picturing a representative sample of farmers and librarians, 

59
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,020
say 200 farmers and 10 librarians.

60
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,059
Then when you hear of this meek and tidy soul description, 

61
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:39,953
let's say that your gut instinct is that 40% of librarians would fit that description, 

62
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,360
and 10% of farmers would.

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,984
If those are your estimates, it would mean that from your sample you would expect 

64
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:50,240
about 4 librarians to fit the description, and about 20 farmers to fit that description.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,365
So the probability that a random person among those who 

66
00:03:55,365 --> 00:04:00,100
fit this description is a librarian is 4 out of 24, or 16.7%.

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,533
So even if you think that a librarian is 4 times as likely as a farmer to fit this 

68
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:09,020
description, that's not enough to overcome the fact that there are way more farmers.

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,038
The upshot, and this is the key mantra underlying Bayes' theorem, 

70
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:16,860
is that new evidence does not completely determine your beliefs in a vacuum.

71
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,220
It should update prior beliefs.

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,949
If this line of reasoning makes sense to you, the way that 

73
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,539
seeing evidence restricts the space of possibilities, 

74
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:29,800
and the ratio you need to consider after that, then congratulations!

75
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,360
You understand the heart of Bayes' theorem.

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,759
Maybe the numbers you would estimate would be a little different, 

77
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,982
but what matters is how you fit the numbers together to update your beliefs based 

78
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:40,600
on evidence.

79
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,038
Now understanding one example is one thing, but see if you can take a minute 

80
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,740
to generalize everything we just did and write it all down as a formula.

81
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,374
The general situation where Bayes' theorem is relevant is when you have some hypothesis, 

82
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:00,667
like Steve is a librarian, and you see some new evidence, 

83
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,188
say this verbal description of Steve as a meek and tidy soul, 

84
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:08,447
and you want to know the probability that your hypothesis holds given that 

85
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:09,640
the evidence is true.

86
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,058
In the standard notation, this vertical bar means given that, 

87
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:18,960
as in we're restricting our view only to the possibilities where the evidence holds.

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,643
Now remember the first relevant number we used, 

89
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:26,077
it was the probability that the hypothesis holds before considering 

90
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:27,340
any of that new evidence.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,342
In our example, that was 1 out of 21, and it came from considering 

92
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:34,640
the ratio of librarians to farmers in the general population.

93
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,980
This number is known as the prior.

94
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,852
After that, we need to consider the proportion of librarians that fit this description, 

95
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:47,300
the probability that we would see the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.

96
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,421
Again, when you see this vertical bar, it means we're talking about 

97
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,840
some proportion of a limited part of the total space of possibilities.

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,300
In this case, that limited part is the left side, where the hypothesis holds.

99
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,337
In the context of Bayes' theorem, this value also has a special name, 

100
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,640
it's called the likelihood.

101
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,512
Similarly, you need to know how much of the other side of the space includes the 

102
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:13,560
evidence, the probability of seeing the evidence given that the hypothesis isn't true.

103
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,420
This funny little elbow symbol is commonly used in probability to mean not.

104
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,700
So with the notation in place, remember what our final answer was, 

105
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,631
the probability that our librarian hypothesis is true given the evidence is the total 

106
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:33,446
number of librarians fitting the evidence, 4, divided by the total number of people 

107
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:34,880
fitting the evidence, 24.

108
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,180
But where did that 4 come from?

109
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,983
Well, it's the total number of people times the prior probability of being a librarian, 

110
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:46,607
giving us the 10 total librarians, times the probability that 

111
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,420
one of those fits the evidence.

112
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,780
That same number shows up again in the denominator, but we need to add in the rest, 

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,688
the total number of people times the proportion who are not librarians, 

114
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:02,140
times the proportion of those who fit the evidence, which in our example gives 20.

115
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,685
Now notice the total number of people here, 210, that gets cancelled out, 

116
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:10,431
and of course it should, that was just an arbitrary choice made for the sake of 

117
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,040
illustration.

118
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,391
This leaves us finally with a more abstract representation purely 

119
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:19,220
in terms of probabilities, and this, my friends, is Bayes' theorem.

120
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,448
More often, you see this denominator written simply as P of E, 

121
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:29,308
the total probability of seeing the evidence, which in our example would be 

122
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:30,460
the 24 out of 210.

123
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
But in practice, to calculate it, you almost always have to break it down 

124
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
into the case where the hypothesis is true, and the one where it isn't.

125
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,956
Capping things off with one final bit of jargon, this answer is called the posterior, 

126
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:48,600
it's your belief about the hypothesis after seeing the evidence.

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,257
Writing it out abstractly might seem more complicated than just 

128
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:56,500
thinking through the example directly with a representative sample.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,780
And yeah, it is.

130
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,785
Keep in mind though, the value of a formula like this is that it 

131
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:06,260
lets you quantify and systematize the idea of changing beliefs.

132
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,039
Scientists use this formula when they're analyzing the extent 

133
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,840
to which new data validates or invalidates their models.

134
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,531
Programmers will sometimes use it in building artificial intelligence, 

135
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:20,640
where at times you want to explicitly and numerically model a machine's belief.

136
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,441
And honestly, just for the way you view yourself and your own 

137
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,993
opinions and what it takes for your mind to change, 

138
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:30,820
Bayes' theorem has a way of reframing how you even think about thought itself.

139
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,468
Putting a formula to it can also be more important 

140
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,340
as the examples get more and more intricate.

141
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,769
However you end up writing it, I actually encourage you not to try 

142
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,680
memorizing the formula, but to instead draw out this diagram as needed.

143
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,842
It's sort of a distilled version of thinking with a representative sample, 

144
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:53,094
where we think with areas instead of counts, which is more flexible and easier to sketch 

145
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:53,620
on the fly.

146
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,737
Rather than bringing to mind some specific number of examples, 

147
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,380
like 210, think of the space of all possibilities as a 1x1 square.

148
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,502
Then any event occupies some subset of this space, 

149
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:10,940
and the probability of that event can be thought about as the area of that subset.

150
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,682
For example, I like to think of the hypothesis as living 

151
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:17,660
in the left part of the square with a width of p of h.

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,042
I recognize I'm being a bit repetitive, but when you see evidence, 

153
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,820
the space of possibilities gets restricted, right?

154
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,045
And the crucial part is that restriction might not be even between 

155
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:33,147
the left and the right, so the new probability for the hypothesis 

156
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:36,940
is the proportion it occupies in this restricted wonky shape.

157
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,860
Now, if you happen to think that a farmer is just as likely to fit the evidence 

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,240
as a librarian, then the proportion doesn't change, which should make sense, right?

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,320
Irrelevant evidence doesn't change your beliefs.

160
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,756
But when these likelihoods are very different from each other, 

161
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,480
that's when your belief changes a lot.

162
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,262
Bayes' theorem spells out what that proportion is, 

163
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:00,520
and if you want you can read it geometrically.

164
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,940
Something like p of h times p of e given h, the probability of both 

165
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,029
the hypothesis and the evidence occurring together, 

166
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:13,080
is the width times the height of this little left rectangle, the area of that region.

167
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,820
Alright, this is probably a good time to take a step back and consider a few of the 

168
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,914
broader takeaways about how to make probability more intuitive, 

169
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,220
beyond just Bayes' theorem.

170
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,115
First off, notice how the trick of thinking about a representative sample with some 

171
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:32,400
specific number of people, like our 210 librarians and farmers, was really helpful.

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,369
There's actually another Kahneman and Tversky result which is all about this, 

173
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,380
and it's interesting enough to interject here.

174
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,578
They did this experiment that was similar to the one with Steve, 

175
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:45,720
but where people were given the following description of a fictitious woman named Linda.

176
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,620
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright.

177
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,160
She majored in philosophy.

178
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,827
As a student she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, 

179
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,540
and also participated in the anti-nuclear demonstrations.

180
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,020
After seeing this, people were asked what's more likely, 1.

181
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,460
That Linda is a bank teller, or 2.

182
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,900
That Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

183
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,110
85%, 85% of participants said that the latter is more likely than the former, 

184
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,310
even though the set of bank tellers who are active in the feminist 

185
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,320
movement is a subset of the set of bank tellers.

186
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,680
It has to be smaller.

187
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,897
So that's interesting enough, but what's fascinating is that there's a simple 

188
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,100
way that you can rephrase the question that dropped this error from 85% to 0.

189
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,422
Instead, if participants were told that there are 100 people who fit this description, 

190
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:43,268
and then they're asked to estimate how many of those 100 are bank tellers, 

191
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:47,320
and how many of them are bank tellers who are active in the feminist movement, 

192
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,500
nobody makes the error.

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,180
Everybody correctly assigns a higher number to the first option than to the second.

194
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,037
It's weird, somehow phrases like 40 out of 100 kick our intuitions 

195
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:02,659
into gear much more effectively than 40%, much less 0.4, 

196
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:08,060
and much less abstractly referencing the idea of something being more or less likely.

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,970
That said, representative samples don't easily capture the continuous 

198
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,694
nature of probability, so turning to area is a nice alternative not just 

199
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,265
because of the continuity, but also because it's way easier to sketch 

200
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:24,040
out when you're sitting there pencil and paper puzzling over some problem.

201
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,514
You see, people often think about probability as being the study of uncertainty, 

202
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:34,127
and that is of course how it's applied in science, but the actual math of probability, 

203
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,679
where all the formulas come from, is just the math of proportions, 

204
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,020
and in that context turning to geometry is exceedingly helpful.

205
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,865
I mean, take a look at Bayes' theorem as a statement about proportions, 

206
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:50,720
whether that's proportions of people, of areas, whatever.

207
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,460
Once you digest what it's saying, it's actually kind of obvious.

208
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,481
Both sides tell you to look at the cases where the evidence is true, 

209
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,720
and then to consider the proportion of those cases where the hypothesis is also true.

210
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,900
That's it, that's all it's saying, the right hand side just spells out how to compute it.

211
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,221
What's noteworthy is that such a straightforward fact about proportions 

212
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:14,903
can become hugely significant for science, for artificial intelligence, 

213
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,920
and really any situation where you want to quantify belief.

214
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,420
I hope to give you a better glimpse of that as we get into more examples.

215
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,740
But before more examples, we have a little bit of unfinished business with Steve.

216
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,434
As I mentioned, some psychologists debate Kahneman and Tversky's conclusion, 

217
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,800
that the rational thing to do is to bring to mind the ratio of farmers to librarians.

218
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,260
They complain that the context is ambiguous.

219
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,840
I mean, who is Steve, exactly?

220
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,660
Should you expect that he's a randomly sampled American?

221
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,307
Or would you be better to assume that he's a friend 

222
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,000
of the two psychologists interrogating you?

223
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,740
Or maybe that he's someone you're personally likely to know?

224
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,400
This assumption determines the prior.

225
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,680
I for one run into way more librarians in a given month than I do farmers.

226
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,610
And needless to say, the probability of a librarian or farmer 

227
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,520
fitting this description is highly open to interpretation.

228
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,267
For our purposes, understanding the math, what I want to emphasize is that 

229
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:12,300
any question worth debating here can be pictured in the context of the diagram.

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,737
Questions about the context shift around the prior, 

231
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:19,474
and questions about the personalities and stereotypes shift around the 

232
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:20,580
relevant likelihoods.

233
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,750
All that said, whether or not you buy this particular experiment, 

234
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,174
the ultimate point that evidence should not determine beliefs, but update them, 

235
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:31,000
is worth tattooing in your brain.

236
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,227
I'm in no position to say whether this does or 

237
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:36,500
does not run against natural human instinct.

238
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,240
We'll leave that to the psychologists.

239
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,260
What's more interesting to me is how we can reprogram our intuition to authentically 

240
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,804
reflect the implications of math, and bringing to mind the right image can often do just 

241
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,060
that.
