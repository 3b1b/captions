1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
The goal is for you to come away from this video understanding one of the most important

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,840
formulas in all of probability, Bayes' theorem.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,400
This formula is central to scientific discovery, it's a core tool in machine learning and

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,460
AI, and it's even been used for treasure hunting, when in the 1980s a small team led

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,960
by Tommy Thompson, and I'm not making up that name, used Bayesian search tactics to

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,300
help uncover a ship that had sunk a century and a half earlier, and the ship was carrying

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,740
what in today's terms amounts to $700 million worth of gold.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,720
So it's a formula worth understanding, but of course there are multiple different levels

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,040
of possible understanding.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,340
At the simplest there's just knowing what each one of the parts means, so that you can

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,040
plug in numbers.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,580
Then there's understanding why it's true, and later I'm going to show you a certain

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,580
diagram that's helpful for rediscovering this formula on the fly as needed.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,540
But maybe the most important level is being able to recognize when you need to use it.

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,140
And with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding, you and I are going to tackle these in reverse

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,560
order.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,260
So before dissecting the formula or explaining the visual that makes it obvious, I'd like

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,860
to tell you about a man named Steve.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Listen carefully now.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,980
Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with very little interest in people

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,160
or the world of reality.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,100
A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,780
Which of the following do you find more likely?

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,380
Steve is a librarian, or Steve is a farmer?

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,420
Some of you may recognize this as an example from a study conducted by the two psychologists

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,440
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Their work was a big deal, it won a Nobel Prize, and it's been popularized many times

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,080
over in books like Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, or Michael Lewis's The Undoing

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,560
Project.

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,620
What they researched was human judgments, with a frequent focus on when these judgments

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,780
irrationally contradict what the laws of probability suggest they should be.

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,460
The example with Steve, our maybe-librarian-maybe-farmer, illustrates one specific type of irrationality,

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,840
or maybe I should say alleged irrationality, there are people who debate the conclusion

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,620
here, but more on all of that later on.

35
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,480
According to Kahneman and Tversky, after people are given this description of Steve as a meek

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,000
and tidy soul, most say he's more likely to be a librarian.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After all, these traits line up better with the stereotypical view of a librarian than

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,460
a farmer.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,880
And according to Kahneman and Tversky, this is irrational.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,840
The point is not whether people hold correct or biased views about the personalities of

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
librarians and farmers, it's that almost nobody thinks to incorporate information about

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,240
the ratio of farmers to librarians in their judgments.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,180
In their paper, Kahneman and Tversky said that in the US that ratio is about 20 to 1.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,820
The numbers I could find today put that much higher, but let's stick with the 20 to 1

45
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,420
number, since it's a little easier to illustrate and proves the point as well.

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,020
To be clear, anyone who has asked this question is not expected to have perfect information

47
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,140
about the actual statistics of farmers and librarians and their personality traits.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,300
But the question is whether people even think to consider that ratio enough to at least

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,220
make a rough estimate.

50
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,460
Rationality is not about knowing facts, it's about recognizing which facts are relevant.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,280
Now if you do think to make that estimate, there's a pretty simple way to reason about

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,620
the question, which, spoiler alert, involves all of the essential reasoning behind Bayes'

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:23,900
theorem.

54
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,400
You might start by picturing a representative sample of farmers and librarians, say 200

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,020
farmers and 10 librarians.

56
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,200
Then when you hear of this meek and tidy soul description, let's say that your gut instinct

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,360
is that 40% of librarians would fit that description, and 10% of farmers would.

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,880
If those are your estimates, it would mean that from your sample you would expect about

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,240
4 librarians to fit the description, and about 20 farmers to fit that description.

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,100
So the probability that a random person among those who fit this description is a librarian

61
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,100
is 4 out of 24, or 16.7%.

62
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,220
So even if you think that a librarian is 4 times as likely as a farmer to fit this description,

63
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,020
that's not enough to overcome the fact that there are way more farmers.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,520
The upshot, and this is the key mantra underlying Bayes' theorem, is that new evidence does

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,860
not completely determine your beliefs in a vacuum.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,220
It should update prior beliefs.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,100
If this line of reasoning makes sense to you, the way that seeing evidence restricts the

68
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,800
space of possibilities, and the ratio you need to consider after that, then congratulations!

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,360
You understand the heart of Bayes' theorem.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,640
Maybe the numbers you would estimate would be a little different, but what matters is

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,600
how you fit the numbers together to update your beliefs based on evidence.

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,460
Now understanding one example is one thing, but see if you can take a minute to generalize

73
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,740
everything we just did and write it all down as a formula.

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
The general situation where Bayes' theorem is relevant is when you have some hypothesis,

75
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,280
like Steve is a librarian, and you see some new evidence, say this verbal description

76
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,020
of Steve as a meek and tidy soul, and you want to know the probability that your hypothesis

77
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,640
holds given that the evidence is true.

78
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,080
In the standard notation, this vertical bar means given that, as in we're restricting

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960
our view only to the possibilities where the evidence holds.

80
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,600
Now remember the first relevant number we used, it was the probability that the hypothesis

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,340
holds before considering any of that new evidence.

82
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,660
In our example, that was 1 out of 21, and it came from considering the ratio of librarians

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,640
to farmers in the general population.

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,980
This number is known as the prior.

85
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,840
After that, we need to consider the proportion of librarians that fit this description, the

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,300
probability that we would see the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.

87
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,780
Again, when you see this vertical bar, it means we're talking about some proportion

88
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,840
of a limited part of the total space of possibilities.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,300
In this case, that limited part is the left side, where the hypothesis holds.

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,280
In the context of Bayes' theorem, this value also has a special name, it's called the

91
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,640
likelihood.

92
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,260
Similarly, you need to know how much of the other side of the space includes the evidence,

93
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,560
the probability of seeing the evidence given that the hypothesis isn't true.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,420
This funny little elbow symbol is commonly used in probability to mean not.

95
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,340
So with the notation in place, remember what our final answer was, the probability that

96
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,860
our librarian hypothesis is true given the evidence is the total number of librarians

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,880
fitting the evidence, 4, divided by the total number of people fitting the evidence, 24.

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,180
But where did that 4 come from?

99
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,820
Well, it's the total number of people times the prior probability of being a librarian,

100
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,420
giving us the 10 total librarians, times the probability that one of those fits the evidence.

101
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,640
That same number shows up again in the denominator, but we need to add in the rest, the total

102
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,300
number of people times the proportion who are not librarians, times the proportion of

103
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,140
those who fit the evidence, which in our example gives 20.

104
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,920
Now notice the total number of people here, 210, that gets cancelled out, and of course

105
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,040
it should, that was just an arbitrary choice made for the sake of illustration.

106
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,460
This leaves us finally with a more abstract representation purely in terms of probabilities,

107
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,220
and this, my friends, is Bayes' theorem.

108
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,360
More often, you see this denominator written simply as P of E, the total probability of

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,460
seeing the evidence, which in our example would be the 24 out of 210.

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,280
But in practice, to calculate it, you almost always have to break it down into the case

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
where the hypothesis is true, and the one where it isn't.

112
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,540
Capping things off with one final bit of jargon, this answer is called the posterior, it's

113
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,600
your belief about the hypothesis after seeing the evidence.

114
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,140
Writing it out abstractly might seem more complicated than just thinking through the

115
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,500
example directly with a representative sample.

116
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,780
And yeah, it is.

117
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,660
Keep in mind though, the value of a formula like this is that it lets you quantify and

118
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,260
systematize the idea of changing beliefs.

119
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,500
Scientists use this formula when they're analyzing the extent to which new data validates

120
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,840
or invalidates their models.

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,360
Programmers will sometimes use it in building artificial intelligence, where at times you

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,640
want to explicitly and numerically model a machine's belief.

123
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,780
And honestly, just for the way you view yourself and your own opinions and what it takes for

124
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,800
your mind to change, Bayes' theorem has a way of reframing how you even think about

125
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,820
thought itself.

126
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,340
Putting a formula to it can also be more important as the examples get more and more intricate.

127
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,560
However you end up writing it, I actually encourage you not to try memorizing the formula,

128
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,680
but to instead draw out this diagram as needed.

129
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,220
It's sort of a distilled version of thinking with a representative sample, where we think

130
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,620
with areas instead of counts, which is more flexible and easier to sketch on the fly.

131
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,580
Rather than bringing to mind some specific number of examples, like 210, think of the

132
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,380
space of all possibilities as a 1x1 square.

133
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,520
Then any event occupies some subset of this space, and the probability of that event can

134
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,940
be thought about as the area of that subset.

135
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,080
For example, I like to think of the hypothesis as living in the left part of the square with

136
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,660
a width of p of h.

137
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,000
I recognize I'm being a bit repetitive, but when you see evidence, the space of possibilities

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,820
gets restricted, right?

139
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,340
And the crucial part is that restriction might not be even between the left and the right,

140
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,000
so the new probability for the hypothesis is the proportion it occupies in this restricted

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,940
wonky shape.

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,040
Now, if you happen to think that a farmer is just as likely to fit the evidence as a

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,240
librarian, then the proportion doesn't change, which should make sense, right?

144
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,320
Irrelevant evidence doesn't change your beliefs.

145
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,600
But when these likelihoods are very different from each other, that's when your belief

146
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
changes a lot.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,520
Bayes' theorem spells out what that proportion is, and if you want you can read it geometrically.

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,620
Something like p of h times p of e given h, the probability of both the hypothesis and

149
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,260
the evidence occurring together, is the width times the height of this little left rectangle,

150
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,080
the area of that region.

151
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,920
Alright, this is probably a good time to take a step back and consider a few of the broader

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,220
takeaways about how to make probability more intuitive, beyond just Bayes' theorem.

153
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,980
First off, notice how the trick of thinking about a representative sample with some specific

154
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,400
number of people, like our 210 librarians and farmers, was really helpful.

155
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,680
There's actually another Kahneman and Tversky result which is all about this, and it's

156
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,380
interesting enough to interject here.

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,500
They did this experiment that was similar to the one with Steve, but where people were

158
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,720
given the following description of a fictitious woman named Linda.

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,620
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright.

160
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,160
She majored in philosophy.

161
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,500
As a student she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice,

162
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,540
and also participated in the anti-nuclear demonstrations.

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,020
After seeing this, people were asked what's more likely, 1.

164
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,460
That Linda is a bank teller, or 2.

165
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,900
That Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

166
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,480
85%, 85% of participants said that the latter is more likely than the former, even though

167
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,480
the set of bank tellers who are active in the feminist movement is a subset of the set

168
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
of bank tellers.

169
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,680
It has to be smaller.

170
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,540
So that's interesting enough, but what's fascinating is that there's a simple way

171
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,100
that you can rephrase the question that dropped this error from 85% to 0.

172
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Instead, if participants were told that there are 100 people who fit this description, and

173
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,380
then they're asked to estimate how many of those 100 are bank tellers, and how many

174
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,500
of them are bank tellers who are active in the feminist movement, nobody makes the error.

175
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,180
Everybody correctly assigns a higher number to the first option than to the second.

176
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,160
It's weird, somehow phrases like 40 out of 100 kick our intuitions into gear much

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,200
more effectively than 40%, much less 0.4, and much less abstractly referencing the idea

178
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,060
of something being more or less likely.

179
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,100
That said, representative samples don't easily capture the continuous nature of probability,

180
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,340
so turning to area is a nice alternative not just because of the continuity, but also because

181
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,280
it's way easier to sketch out when you're sitting there pencil and paper puzzling over

182
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,040
some problem.

183
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,040
You see, people often think about probability as being the study of uncertainty, and that

184
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,400
is of course how it's applied in science, but the actual math of probability, where

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,200
all the formulas come from, is just the math of proportions, and in that context turning

186
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,020
to geometry is exceedingly helpful.

187
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,640
I mean, take a look at Bayes' theorem as a statement about proportions, whether that's

188
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,720
proportions of people, of areas, whatever.

189
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,460
Once you digest what it's saying, it's actually kind of obvious.

190
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,280
Both sides tell you to look at the cases where the evidence is true, and then to consider

191
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,720
the proportion of those cases where the hypothesis is also true.

192
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,660
That's it, that's all it's saying, the right hand side just spells out how to compute

193
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:06,900
it.

194
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,820
What's noteworthy is that such a straightforward fact about proportions can become hugely significant

195
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,960
for science, for artificial intelligence, and really any situation where you want to

196
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,920
quantify belief.

197
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,420
I hope to give you a better glimpse of that as we get into more examples.

198
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,740
But before more examples, we have a little bit of unfinished business with Steve.

199
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,460
As I mentioned, some psychologists debate Kahneman and Tversky's conclusion, that

200
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,800
the rational thing to do is to bring to mind the ratio of farmers to librarians.

201
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,260
They complain that the context is ambiguous.

202
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,840
I mean, who is Steve, exactly?

203
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,660
Should you expect that he's a randomly sampled American?

204
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,720
Or would you be better to assume that he's a friend of the two psychologists interrogating

205
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,000
you?

206
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,740
Or maybe that he's someone you're personally likely to know?

207
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,400
This assumption determines the prior.

208
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,680
I for one run into way more librarians in a given month than I do farmers.

209
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,480
And needless to say, the probability of a librarian or farmer fitting this description

210
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,520
is highly open to interpretation.

211
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,780
For our purposes, understanding the math, what I want to emphasize is that any question

212
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,300
worth debating here can be pictured in the context of the diagram.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,100
Questions about the context shift around the prior, and questions about the personalities

214
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,580
and stereotypes shift around the relevant likelihoods.

215
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,640
All that said, whether or not you buy this particular experiment, the ultimate point

216
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,700
that evidence should not determine beliefs, but update them, is worth tattooing in your

217
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,000
brain.

218
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm in no position to say whether this does or does not run against natural human instinct.

219
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,240
We'll leave that to the psychologists.

220
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,300
What's more interesting to me is how we can reprogram our intuition to authentically

221
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,060
reflect the implications of math, and bringing to mind the right image can often do just

222
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,740
that.
