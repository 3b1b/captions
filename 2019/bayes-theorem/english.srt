1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The goal is for you to come away from this video understanding one of the most important

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,560
formulas in all of probability, Bayes' theorem.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,360
This formula is central to scientific discovery, it's a core tool in machine learning and

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,400
AI, and it's even been used for treasure hunting, when in the 1980s a small team led

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,860
by Tommy Thompson, and I'm not making up that name, used Bayesian search tactics to

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,280
help uncover a ship that had sunk a century and a half earlier, and the ship was carrying

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,480
what in today's terms amounts to $700 million worth of gold.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,680
So it's a formula worth understanding, but of course there are multiple different levels

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
of possible understanding.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,180
At the simplest there's just knowing what each one of the parts means, so that you can

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,920
plug in numbers.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,480
Then there's understanding why it's true, and later I'm going to show you a certain

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,340
diagram that's helpful for rediscovering this formula on the fly as needed.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,120
But maybe the most important level is being able to recognize when you need to use it.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,240
And with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding, you and I are going to tackle these in reverse

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
order.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,120
So before dissecting the formula or explaining the visual that makes it obvious, I'd like

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,360
to tell you about a man named Steve.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,880
Listen carefully now.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,080
Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with very little interest in people

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
or the world of reality.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,040
A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Which of the following do you find more likely?

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,500
Steve is a librarian, or Steve is a farmer?

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,640
Some of you may recognize this as an example from a study conducted by the two psychologists

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,260
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,980
Their work was a big deal, it won a Nobel Prize, and it's been popularized many times

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,200
over in books like Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, or Michael Lewis's The Undoing

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
Project.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,960
What they researched was human judgments, with a frequent focus on when these judgments

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,380
irrationally contradict what the laws of probability suggest they should be.

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,280
The example with Steve, our maybe librarian, maybe farmer, illustrates one specific type

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,320
of irrationality, or maybe I should say alleged irrationality, there are people who debate

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,040
the conclusion here, but more on that later on.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,380
According to Kahneman and Tversky, after people are given this description of Steve as a meek

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,800
and tidy soul, most say he's more likely to be a librarian.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,960
After all, these traits line up better with the stereotypical view of a librarian than

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
a farmer.

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,760
And according to Kahneman and Tversky, this is irrational.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,760
The point is not whether people hold correct or biased views about the personalities of

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,760
librarians and farmers, it's that almost nobody thinks to incorporate information about

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,040
the ratio of farmers to librarians in their judgments.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,080
In their paper, Kahneman and Tversky said that in the US, that ratio is about 20 to

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
1.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,040
The numbers I could find today put that much higher, but let's stick with the 20 to 1

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,360
number, since it's a little easier to illustrate and proves the point as well.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,120
To be clear, anyone who is asked this question is not expected to have perfect information

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,760
about the actual statistics of farmers and librarians and their personality traits.

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,320
But the question is whether people even think to consider that ratio enough to at least

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,460
make a rough estimate.

51
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,880
Rationality is not about knowing facts, it's about recognizing which facts are relevant.

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,280
Now if you do think to make that estimate, there's a pretty simple way to reason about

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
the question, which, spoiler alert, involves all of the essential reasoning behind Bayes'

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
theorem.

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,760
You might start by picturing a representative sample of farmers and librarians, say 200

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
farmers and 10 librarians.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,280
Then when you hear of this meek and tidy soul description, let's say that your gut instinct

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,260
is that 40% of librarians would fit that description, and that 10% of farmers would.

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,860
If those are your estimates, it would mean that from your sample you would expect about

60
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,060
4 librarians to fit the description, and about 20 farmers to fit that description.

61
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,540
So the probability that a random person among those who fit this description is a librarian

62
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,460
is 4 out of 24, or 16.7%.

63
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,340
So even if you think that a librarian is 4 times as likely as a farmer to fit this description,

64
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,740
that's not enough to overcome the fact that there are way more farmers.

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,500
The upshot, and this is the key mantra underlying Bayes' theorem, is that new evidence does

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,340
not completely determine your beliefs in a vacuum, it should update prior beliefs.

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,020
If this line of reasoning makes sense to you, the way that seeing evidence restricts the

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,460
space of possibilities and the ratio you need to consider after that, then congratulations,

69
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,180
you understand the heart of Bayes' theorem.

70
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,600
Maybe the numbers you would estimate would be a little different, but what matters is

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,840
how you fit the numbers together to update your beliefs based on evidence.

72
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,360
Understanding one example is one thing, but see if you can take a minute to generalize

73
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,560
everything we just did and write it all down as a formula.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,400
The general situation where Bayes' theorem is relevant is when you have some hypothesis,

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,320
like Steve is a librarian, and you see some new evidence, say this verbal description

76
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
of Steve as a meek and tidy soul.

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,480
You want to know the probability that your hypothesis holds given that the evidence is

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,640
true.

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,120
In the standard notation, this vertical bar means given that, as in we're restricting

80
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,720
our view only to the possibilities where the evidence holds.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,300
Remember the first relevant number we used, the probability that the hypothesis holds

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,940
before considering any of that new evidence.

83
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,680
In our example, that was 1 out of 21, and it came from considering the ratio of librarians

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,600
to farmers in the general population.

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,280
This number is known as the prior.

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,040
After that, we need to consider the proportion of librarians that fit this description, the

87
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,800
probability that we would see the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,100
Again, when you see this vertical bar, it means we're talking about some proportion

89
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,560
of a limited part of the total space of possibilities.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,040
In this case, that limited part is the left side, where the hypothesis holds.

91
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,840
In the context of Bayes' theorem, this value also has a special name, it's called

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
the likelihood.

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,780
Similarly, you need to know how much of the other side of the space includes the evidence,

94
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,500
the probability of seeing the evidence given that the hypothesis isn't true.

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,160
This funny little elbow symbol is commonly used in probability to mean not.

96
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,500
So, with the notation in place, remember what our final answer was.

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,860
The probability that our librarian hypothesis is true given the evidence is the total number

98
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,700
of librarians fitting the evidence, 4, divided by the total number of people fitting the

99
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,860
evidence, 24.

100
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,460
But where did that 4 come from?

101
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,300
Well, it's the total number of people, times the prior probability of being a librarian,

102
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,420
giving us the 10 total librarians, times the probability that one of those fits the evidence.

103
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,600
That same number shows up again in the denominator, but we need to add in the rest, the total

104
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,240
number of people times the proportion who are not librarians, times the proportion of

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,200
those who fit the evidence, which in our example gives 20.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,860
Now notice the total number of people here, 210, that gets cancelled out, and of course

107
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,680
it should, that was just an arbitrary choice made for the sake of illustration.

108
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,160
This leaves us finally with a more abstract representation purely in terms of probabilities,

109
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,880
and this, my friends, is Bayes' theorem.

110
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,280
More often, you see this denominator written simply as P of E, the total probability of

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,280
seeing the evidence, which in our example would be the 24 out of 210.

112
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,260
But in practice, to calculate it, you almost always have to break it down into the case

113
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,240
where the hypothesis is true, and the one where it isn't.

114
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,600
Capping things off with one final bit of jargon, this answer is called the posterior, it's

115
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,420
your belief about the hypothesis after seeing the evidence.

116
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,000
Writing it out abstractly might seem more complicated than just thinking through the

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
example directly with a representative sample.

118
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
And yeah, it is.

119
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,540
Keep in mind though, the value of a formula like this is that it lets you quantify and

120
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,360
systematize the idea of changing beliefs.

121
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Scientists use this formula when they're analyzing the extent to which new data validates

122
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,700
or invalidates their models.

123
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,280
Programmers will sometimes use it in building artificial intelligence, where at times you

124
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,380
want to explicitly and numerically model a machine's belief.

125
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,680
And honestly, just for the way you view yourself and your own opinions and what it takes for

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,700
your mind to change, Bayes' theorem has a way of reframing how you even think about

127
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,340
thought itself.

128
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,100
Putting a formula to it can also be more important as the examples get more and more intricate.

129
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,020
However you write it, I actually encourage you not to try memorizing the formula, but

130
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,900
to instead draw out this diagram as needed.

131
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,180
It's sort of a distilled version of thinking with a representative sample, where we think

132
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,220
with areas instead of counts, which is more flexible and easier to sketch on the fly.

133
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,500
Rather than bringing to mind some specific number of examples, like 210, think of the

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,400
space of all possibilities as a 1x1 square.

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,460
Then any event occupies some subset of this space, and the probability of that event can

136
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,800
be thought about as the area of that subset.

137
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,020
For example, I like to think of the hypothesis as living in the left part of the square with

138
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,380
a width of p of h.

139
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,020
I recognize I'm being a bit repetitive, but when you see evidence, the space of possibilities

140
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,580
gets restricted, and the crucial part is that restriction might not be even between the

141
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,820
left and the right, so the new probability for the hypothesis is the proportion it occupies

142
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,900
in this restricted wonky shape.

143
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,220
Now if you think a farmer is just as likely to fit the evidence as a librarian, then the

144
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,660
proportion doesn't change, which should make sense, right?

145
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,980
And evidence doesn't change your beliefs.

146
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,580
But when these likelihoods are very different from each other, that's when your belief

147
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,740
changes a lot.

148
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,240
Bayes' theorem spells out what that proportion is, and if you want you can read it geometrically.

149
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,620
Something like p of h times p of e given h, the probability of both the hypothesis and

150
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,700
the evidence occurring together, is the width times the height of this little left rectangle,

151
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,980
the area of that region.

152
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,860
Alright, this is probably a good time to take a step back and consider a few of the broader

153
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,940
takeaways about how to make probability more intuitive, beyond Bayes' theorem.

154
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,000
First off, notice how the trick of thinking about a representative sample with some specific

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,660
number of people, like our 210 librarians and farmers, was really helpful.

156
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,940
There's actually another Kahneman and Tversky result which is all about this, and it's

157
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,380
interesting enough to interject here.

158
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,420
They did this experiment that was similar to the one with Steve, but where people were

159
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,740
given the following description of a fictitious woman named Linda.

160
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,220
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright.

161
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,820
She majored in philosophy.

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,940
As a student she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice,

163
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,020
and also participated in the anti-nuclear demonstrations.

164
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,500
After seeing this people were asked what's more likely, 1.

165
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,080
That Linda is a bank teller, or 2.

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,380
That Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

167
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,740
85%, 85% of participants said that the latter is more likely than the former, even though

168
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,460
the set of bank tellers who are active in the feminist movement is a subset of the set

169
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,660
of bank tellers.

170
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,020
It has to be smaller.

171
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,420
So that's interesting enough, but what's fascinating is that there's a simple way

172
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,420
that you can rephrase the question that dropped this error from 85% to 0.

173
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,740
Instead, if participants were told that there are 100 people who fit this description, and

174
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,100
then asked to estimate how many of those 100 are bank tellers, and how many are bank

175
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,140
tellers active in the feminist movement, nobody makes the error.

176
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,820
Everybody correctly assigns a higher number to the first option than to the second.

177
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,300
It's weird, somehow phrases like 40 out of 100 kick our intuitions into gear much more

178
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,660
effectively than 40%, much less 0.4, and much less abstractly referencing the idea of something

179
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,500
being more or less likely.

180
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,560
That said, representative samples don't easily capture the continuous nature of probability.

181
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,980
So turning to area is a nice alternative, not just because of the continuity, but also

182
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,020
because it's way easier to sketch out when you're sitting there pencil and paper puzzling

183
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,660
over some problem.

184
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,520
People often think about probability as being the study of uncertainty, and that is of course

185
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,020
how it's applied in science, but the actual math of probability, where all the formulas

186
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,980
come from, is just the math of proportions, and in that context turning to geometry is

187
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,300
exceedingly helpful.

188
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,980
I mean, take a look at Bayes' theorem as a statement about proportions, whether that's

189
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,460
proportions of people, of areas, whatever.

190
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,120
Once you digest what it's saying, it's actually kind of obvious.

191
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,340
Both sides tell you to look at the cases where the evidence is true, and then to consider

192
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,980
the proportion of those cases where the hypothesis is also true.

193
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,940
That's it, that's all it's saying.

194
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,380
The right-hand side just spells out how to compute it.

195
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,880
What's noteworthy is that such a straightforward fact about proportions can become hugely significant

196
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,780
for science, for artificial intelligence, and really any situation where you want to

197
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,460
quantify belief.

198
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,460
I hope to give you a better glimpse of that as we get into more examples.

199
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,620
But before more examples, we have a little bit of unfinished business with Steve.

200
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,620
As I mentioned, some psychologists debate Kahneman and Tversky's conclusion that the

201
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,300
rational thing to do is to bring to mind the ratio of farmers to librarians.

202
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,420
They complain that the context is ambiguous.

203
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,500
I mean, who is Steve, exactly?

204
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,260
Should you expect that he's a randomly sampled American?

205
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,860
Or would you be better to assume that he's a friend of the two psychologists interrogating

206
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,860
you?

207
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,540
Or maybe that he's someone you're personally likely to know?

208
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,820
This assumption determines the prior.

209
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,540
I for one run into way more librarians in a given month than I do farmers.

210
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,420
Needless to say, the probability of a librarian or a farmer fitting this description is highly

211
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,500
open to interpretation.

212
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,740
For our purposes, understanding the math, what I want to emphasize is that any question

213
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,220
worth debating here can be pictured in the context of the diagram.

214
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,140
Questions about the context shift around the prior, and questions about the personalities

215
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,260
and stereotypes shift around the relevant likelihoods.

216
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,580
All that said, whether or not you buy this particular experiment, the ultimate point

217
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,740
that evidence should not determine beliefs, but update them, is worth tattooing in your

218
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
brain.

219
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,540
I'm in no position to say whether this does or does not run against natural human instinct.

220
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,420
We'll leave that to the psychologists.

221
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,300
What's more interesting to me is how we can reprogram our intuition to authentically

222
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,260
reflect the implications of math, and bringing to mind the right image can often do just

223
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,780
that.
