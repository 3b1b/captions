00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,180
Last video I left you with a puzzle.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,200
The setup involves two sliding blocks in a perfectly idealized world where there's 

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,520
no friction and all collisions are perfectly elastic, meaning no energy is lost.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,418
One block is sent towards another smaller one, 

5
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:20,305
which starts off stationary and there's a wall behind it, 

6
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:24,485
so that the smaller block bounces back and forth until it redirects the big block's 

7
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:27,720
momentum enough to fully turn around, sailing away from the wall.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,171
If that first block has a mass which is a power of 100 times the mass of the second, 

9
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:37,580
for example a million times as much, an insanely surprising fact popped out.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,337
The total number of collisions, including those between the second mass and the wall, 

11
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:44,200
has the same starting digits as pi.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,740
In this example that's 3141 collisions.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,195
If that first block was a trillion times the mass, 

14
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:56,140
it would be 3,141,592 collisions before this happens.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,540
Almost all of which happen in one huge unrealistic burst.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,421
And speaking of unexpectedly big bursts, in the short time since that video went out, 

17
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:08,860
lots of people have been sharing solutions and attempts and simulations, which is awesome.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,660
So why does this happen?

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Why should pi show up in such an unexpected place and in such an unexpected manner?

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,243
Foremost this is a lesson about using phase space, 

21
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:22,400
also commonly called configuration space, to solve problems.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,711
So rest assured that you're not just learning about some esoteric algorithm for pi, 

23
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:31,280
this tactic here is core to many other fields, and is a useful tool to keep in your belt.

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,423
To start, when one block hits another, how do you 

25
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,980
figure out the velocity of each one after the collision?

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,920
The key is to use the conservation of energy together with the conservation of momentum.

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,120
Let's call their masses m1 and m2, and their velocities v1 and v2, 

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,080
which will be the variables changing throughout the process.

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:00,300
At any given point, the total kinetic energy is ½ m1 v1² plus ½ m2 v2².

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,960
So even though v1 and v2 will be changing as the blocks get bumped around, 

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,720
the value of this expression must remain constant.

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,100
The total momentum of the two blocks is m1v1 plus m2v2.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,637
This also has to remain constant when the blocks hit each other, 

34
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:21,540
but it can change as the second block bounces off the wall.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,078
In reality, the second block would transfer its momentum to the wall during 

36
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,604
this collision, and again we're being idealistic, 

37
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:31,180
say thinking of that wall as having infinite mass, 

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,060
so such a momentum transfer won't actually move the wall.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,020
So here we have two equations and two unknowns.

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,360
To put these to use, try drawing a picture to represent the equations.

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,380
You might start by focusing on the energy equation.

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,639
Since v1 and v2 are changing, maybe you think to represent the equation 

43
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,020
on a coordinate plane where x is equal to v1 and y is equal to v2.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,880
So individual points on this plane encode the pair of velocities of our block.

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,416
In that case, the energy equation represents an ellipse, 

46
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,743
where each point of this ellipse gives you a pair of velocities, 

47
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,660
all of which correspond to the same total kinetic energy.

48
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,879
In fact, let's change our coordinates a little bit to make this a perfect circle, 

49
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,820
since we know we're on a hunt for pi.

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,749
Instead of having the x-coordinate represent v1, 

51
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:24,069
let it be the square root of m1 times v1, which for this example stretches the figure in 

52
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,520
the x-direction by the square root of 10.

53
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,260
Likewise, have the y-coordinate represent square root of m2 times v2.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,638
That way, when you look at the conservation of energy equation, 

55
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:39,005
what it's saying is ½ x2 plus y2 equals some constant, 

56
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:44,331
which is the equation for a circle, which specific circle depends on the total energy, 

57
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:46,780
but that doesn't matter for our problem.

58
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,755
At the beginning, when the first block is sliding to the left and 

59
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:54,445
the second one is stationary, we're at the leftmost point on the circle, 

60
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,680
where the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is zero.

61
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,740
What about right after the collision?

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,040
How do we know what happens?

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,474
Conservation of energy tells us that we must jump to some other point of the circle, 

64
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:06,080
but which one?

65
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,940
Use the conservation of momentum.

66
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,573
This tells us that before and after the collision, 

67
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:16,620
the value of m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2 must stay constant.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,270
In our rescaled coordinates, that looks like saying square root 

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,220
of m1 times x plus square root of m2 times y equals some constant.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,782
And that's the equation for a line, specifically a 

71
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:32,320
line with a slope of negative square root of m1 over m2.

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,632
You might ask which specific line, and that depends on what the constant momentum is, 

73
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:42,240
but we know that it must pass through our first point, and that locks us into one choice.

74
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,577
So just to be clear about what all this is saying, 

75
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,724
all other pairs of velocities which would give the same momentum live on this line, 

76
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:53,772
in just the same way that all other pairs of velocities that give the same energy 

77
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,760
live on this circle.

78
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,120
So notice, this gives us one and only one other point that we could jump to.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,350
And it should make sense that it's something where the x-coordinate gets a little less 

80
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,290
negative and the y-coordinate becomes negative, since that corresponds to the big block, 

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,920
which is slowing down a little, while the little block zooms off towards the wall.

82
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,640
From here it's quite fun to see how things play out.

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,363
When the second block bounces off the wall, its speed stays the same, 

84
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,500
but it goes from negative to positive, right?

85
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,199
So in this diagram, that corresponds to reflecting about the x-axis, 

86
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,180
since the y-coordinate gets multiplied by negative 1.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,030
Then once more, the next collision corresponds to a jump along a line 

88
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,736
with slope negative square root of m1 over m2, 

89
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:41,860
since staying on such a line is what conservation of momentum looks like in this diagram.

90
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,831
And from here you can fill in the rest for how the block collisions 

91
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:50,196
correspond to hopping around the circle in our picture, where we keep going like this, 

92
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:53,959
until the velocity of that smaller block is both positive and smaller than 

93
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,120
the velocity of the big one, meaning they'll never touch again.

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,837
That corresponds to this triangular region in the upper right of the diagram, 

95
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:05,140
so in our region.

96
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,243
What we've drawn here is called a phase diagram, 

97
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:15,257
which is a simple but powerful idea in math where you encode the state of some system, 

98
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,197
in this case the velocities of our sliding blocks, 

99
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:20,560
as a single point in some abstract space.

100
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,453
What's powerful here is that it turns questions 

101
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:25,660
about dynamics into questions about geometry.

102
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
In this case, the dynamical idea of all possible pairs of velocities 

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,705
that conserve energy corresponds to the geometric idea of a circle, 

104
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,411
and counting the total number of collisions turns into counting the 

105
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:41,880
total number of hops along these lines, alternating between vertical and diagonal.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,011
But our question remains, why is it that when that mass ratio is a power of 100, 

107
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,200
the total number of steps shows the digits of pi?

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,369
Well, if you stare at this picture, maybe, just maybe, 

109
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:02,919
you'd notice that all the arc lengths between the points on this circle seem 

110
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,160
to be about the same.

111
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,183
It's not immediately obvious that this should be true, but if it is, 

112
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:11,725
it means that computing the value of one such arc length should be enough 

113
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:15,460
to figure out how many total collisions it takes to get us into that end zone.

114
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,354
The key here is to use the ever-helpful inscribed angle theorem, 

115
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:25,629
which says that whenever you're forming an angle using three points on a circle, P1, 

116
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:30,222
P2, and P3, like this, it will be exactly half of the angle formed by P1, 

117
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:31,960
the circle's center, and P3.

118
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,612
P2 can be anywhere on this circle, anywhere except between P1 and P3, 

119
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,940
and this lovely little fact will be true.

120
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,860
So now look back at our phase space, and focus specifically on three points, like these.

121
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,005
Remember that first vertical hop corresponds to the second block bouncing off the wall, 

122
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:53,742
and that second hop, along a slope of negative square root of m1 over m2, 

123
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:56,420
corresponds to a momentum-conserving block collision.

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,619
Let's call the angle between this momentum line and the vertical line theta, 

125
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:05,063
and now maybe you see it using the inscribed angle theorem, 

126
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:10,000
this arc length between those two bottom points, measured in radians, will be 2 theta.

127
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,514
And importantly, since the momentum line has the same slope for all 

128
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:17,611
of those jumps from the top of the circle to the bottom, 

129
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:21,740
the same reasoning means that all of these arc lengths must also be 2 theta.

130
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,825
So for each hop, if we drop down a new arc, like so, 

131
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:31,240
then after each collision we cover another 2 theta radians of the circle.

132
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,176
We stop once we're in the end zone on the right, 

133
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:37,388
which remember corresponds to both blocks moving to the right with the 

134
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:38,520
smaller one going slower.

135
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,671
But you can also think of this as stopping at the point when 

136
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:46,440
adding one more arc of 2 theta would overlap with the previous one.

137
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,820
In other words, how many times do you have to add 2 theta to itself 

138
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,200
before it covers more than the whole circle, more than 2 pi radians?

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,540
The answer to this will be the same as the number of collisions between our blocks.

140
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,408
Or to say the same thing more compactly, what's the 

141
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,920
largest integer multiple of theta that doesn't surpass pi?

142
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,783
For example, if theta was 0.01 radians, then multiplying it by as much as 314 

143
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:19,900
would keep you below pi, but multiplying by 315 would bring you over that value.

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,381
So the answer would be 314, meaning if our mass ratio was one such that the 

145
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:32,340
angle theta in our diagram was 0.01, then the blocks would collide 314 times.

146
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,220
So now you know what we need to do.

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,540
Let's go ahead and actually compute the value theta, say when the mass ratio is 100 to 1.

148
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,023
Remember, this rise over run slope of that constant momentum line was the 

149
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:52,920
negative square root of m1 over m2, which in this example is negative 10.

150
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,398
That would mean that the tangent of this angle theta, opposite over adjacent, 

151
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:05,080
is the run over the negative rise, so to speak, which is 1 divided by 10 in this example.

152
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,440
So theta is going to be the arctan of 1 tenth.

153
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,137
Speaking more generally, it'll be the inverse tangent of the 

154
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:18,000
square root of the small mass over the square root of the big mass.

155
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,856
If you plug these into a calculator, what you'd notice is that the inverse 

156
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,800
tangent of such a small value is actually quite close to the value itself.

157
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,525
For example, arctan of 1 over 100, corresponding to a big mass of 10,000 kg, 

158
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,680
is extremely close to 0.01.

159
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,656
In fact, it's so close that for the sake of our central question, 

160
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,360
it might as well be 0.01.

161
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,682
What I mean by that is, analogous to what we saw a moment ago, 

162
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:53,720
adding this to itself as many as 314 times won't surpass pi, but the 315th time would.

163
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,219
Remember, unraveling why we're doing all this, 

164
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:01,749
that's a way of counting how many jumps on the phase diagram gets us into the end zone, 

165
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:06,021
which in turn is a way of counting how many times the blocks collide until they're 

166
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,720
sailing off to never touch again.

167
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,720
So that, my friends, is why a mass ratio of 10,000 gives 314 collisions.

168
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,060
Likewise, a mass ratio of a million to one will give an 

169
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,340
angle theta equals the inverse tangent of 1 over 1000.

170
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,220
This is extremely close to 0.001.

171
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,099
And again, if we ask about the largest integer multiple of this angle that doesn't 

172
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:38,300
surpass pi, it's the same as it would be for a precise value of 0.001, namely 3141.

173
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,524
These are the first four digits of pi because that is, 

174
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:45,040
by definition, what digits of a number mean.

175
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,140
This explains why when the mass ratio is a million, the number of collisions is 3141.

176
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,337
And you might notice that all of this relies on the hope that the inverse tangent 

177
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,803
of a small value is sufficiently close to the value itself, 

178
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:07,540
which is another way of saying that the tangent of a small value is approximately 

179
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,580
that value itself.

180
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,500
Intuitively, there's a really nice reason this is true.

181
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,408
If you look at a unit circle, the tangent of any given angle is 

182
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:19,060
the height of this little triangle I've drawn divided by its width.

183
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,265
And when that angle is really small, the width is basically 1, 

184
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:27,226
the radius of your circle, and the height is basically the same as 

185
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:31,780
the arc length along that circle, and by definition that arc length is theta.

186
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,427
To be more precise about it, the Taylor series expansion of tangent of 

187
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:40,320
theta shows that this approximation will have only a cubic error term.

188
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,351
So for example, the tangent of 1 one hundredth differs from 1 

189
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:47,940
one hundredth itself by something on the order of 1 one millionth.

190
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,200
So even if we were to consider 314 steps with this angle, 

191
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,227
the error between the actual value of arc tan 1 over 100 and the approximation 

192
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:02,700
of 0.01 just won't have a chance to accumulate high enough to be as big as an integer.

193
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,980
So let's zoom out and sum up.

194
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,458
When blocks collide, you can figure out their new velocities 

195
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,045
by slicing a line through a circle in a velocity phase diagram, 

196
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:17,240
where each of these curves represents a conservation law.

197
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,992
Most notably, the conservation of energy is what plants that circular 

198
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:24,960
seed that ultimately blossoms into the pi that we find in the final count.

199
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,530
Specifically, due to some inscribed angle geometry, 

200
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,945
the points that we hit of this circle are spaced out evenly, 

201
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,520
separated by an angle we were calling 2 theta.

202
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,703
This lets us rephrase the question of counting collisions, 

203
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:43,960
as instead asking how many times must we add 2 theta to itself before it surpasses 2 pi.

204
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,181
If theta looks something like 0.001, the answer to that question has the 

205
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:53,618
same first digits as pi, and when the mass ratio is some power of 100, 

206
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:57,868
because arc tan of x is so well approximated by x for small values, 

207
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:02,680
theta is sufficiently close to this value that it gives the same final count.

208
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,679
I'll emphasize again what this phase space allowed us to do, 

209
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,946
because as I said, this is a lesson useful for all sorts of math, 

210
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:13,560
like differential equations, chaos theory, and other flavors of dynamics.

211
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,163
By representing the relevant state of your system as a single point in an abstract space, 

212
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:23,060
it lets you translate problems of dynamics into problems of geometry.

213
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,359
I repeat myself because I don't want you to come away just remembering a 

214
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,969
neat puzzle where pi shows up unexpectedly, I want you to remember this 

215
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:34,880
surprise appearance as a distilled remnant of the deeper relationship at play.

216
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,078
And if this solution leaves you feeling satisfied, it shouldn't, 

217
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,817
because there is another perspective, more clever and pretty than this one, 

218
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,720
due to Galperin and his original paper on this phenomenon, 

219
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,755
which invites us to draw a striking parallel between the dynamics of these blocks 

220
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,560
and that of a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors.

221
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,412
Trust me, I've saved the best for last on this topic, 

222
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,240
so I hope to see you again in the next video.
