00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Last video I left you with a puzzle.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,900
The setup involves two sliding blocks in a perfectly idealized world where there's

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,180
no friction and all collisions are perfectly elastic, meaning no energy is lost.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,200
One block is sent towards another smaller one, which starts off stationary and there's

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,920
a wall behind it, so that the smaller block bounces back and forth until it redirects

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
the big block's momentum enough to fully turn around, sailing away from the wall.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,380
If that first block has a mass which is a power of 100 times the mass of the second,

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,860
for example a million times as much, an insanely surprising fact popped out.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,080
The total number of collisions, including those between the second mass and the wall,

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,040
has the same starting digits as pi.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,480
In this example that's 3141 collisions.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,480
If that first block was a trillion times the mass, it would be 3141592 collisions before

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,800
this happens.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,120
Almost all of which happen in one huge unrealistic burst.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,480
And speaking of unexpectedly big bursts, in the short time since that video went out,

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,480
lots of people have been sharing solutions and attempts and simulations, which is awesome.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,960
So why does this happen?

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,720
Why should pi show up in such an unexpected place and in such an unexpected manner?

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,000
Foremost this is a lesson about using phase space, also commonly called configuration

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,680
space, to solve problems.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,840
So rest assured that you're not just learning about some esoteric algorithm for pi, this

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,180
tactic here is core to many other fields, and is a useful tool to keep in your belt.

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,040
To start, when one block hits another, how do you figure out the velocity of each one

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,800
after the collision?

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,200
The key is to use the conservation of energy together with the conservation of momentum.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,760
Let's call their masses m1 and m2, and their velocities v1 and v2, which will be the variables

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,300
changing throughout the process.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:00,860
At any given point, the total kinetic energy is ½ m1 v1² plus ½ m2 v2².

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,220
So even though v1 and v2 will be changing as the blocks get bumped around, the value

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,920
of this expression must remain constant.

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,660
The total momentum of the two blocks is m1v1 plus m2v2.

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,940
This also has to remain constant when the blocks hit each other, but it can change as

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,300
the second block bounces off the wall.

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,700
In reality, the second block would transfer its momentum to the wall during this collision,

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,720
and again we're being idealistic, say thinking of that wall as having infinite mass, so such

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,140
a momentum transfer won't actually move the wall.

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,220
So here we have two equations and two unknowns.

38
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,120
To put these to use, try drawing a picture to represent the equations.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,060
You might start by focusing on the energy equation.

40
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,340
Since v1 and v2 are changing, maybe you think to represent the equation on a coordinate

41
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,620
plane where x is equal to v1 and y is equal to v2.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,100
So individual points on this plane encode the pair of velocities of our block.

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,240
In that case, the energy equation represents an ellipse, where each point of this ellipse

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,620
gives you a pair of velocities, all of which correspond to the same total kinetic energy.

45
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,780
In fact, let's change our coordinates a little bit to make this a perfect circle,

46
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,840
since we know we're on a hunt for pi.

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Instead of having the x-coordinate represent v1, let it be the square root of m1 times

48
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,000
v1, which for this example stretches the figure in the x-direction by the square root of 10.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Likewise, have the y-coordinate represent square root of m2 times v2.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,860
That way, when you look at the conservation of energy equation, what it's saying is

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:43,080
½ x2 plus y2 equals some constant, which is the equation for a circle, which specific

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,640
circle depends on the total energy, but that doesn't matter for our problem.

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,840
At the beginning, when the first block is sliding to the left and the second one is

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,400
stationary, we're at the leftmost point on the circle, where the x-coordinate is negative

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
and the y-coordinate is zero.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,180
What about right after the collision?

57
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,280
How do we know what happens?

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,520
Conservation of energy tells us that we must jump to some other point of the circle, but

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,720
which one?

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Use the conservation of momentum.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,600
This tells us that before and after the collision, the value of m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,480
must stay constant.

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,220
In our rescaled coordinates, that looks like saying square root of m1 times x plus square

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,040
root of m2 times y equals some constant, and that's the equation for a line, specifically

65
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,320
a line with a slope of negative square root of m1 over m2.

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,880
You might ask which specific line, and that depends on what the constant momentum is,

67
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,100
but we know that it must pass through our first point, and that locks us into one choice.

68
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,360
So just to be clear about what all this is saying, all other pairs of velocities which

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
would give the same momentum live on this line, in just the same way that all other

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
pairs of velocities that give the same energy live on this circle.

71
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,780
So notice, this gives us one and only one other point that we could jump to, and it

72
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,480
should make sense that it's something where the x-coordinate gets a little less negative

73
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,800
and the y-coordinate becomes negative, since that corresponds to the big block slowing

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,680
down a little, while the little block zooms off towards the wall.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,120
From here, it's quite fun to see how things play out.

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,020
When the second block bounces off the wall, its speed stays the same, but it goes from

77
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,780
negative to positive, right?

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,800
So in this diagram, that corresponds to reflecting about the x-axis, since the y-coordinate gets

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,720
multiplied by negative 1.

80
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,840
Then, once more, the next collision corresponds to a jump along a line with slope negative

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,160
square root of m1 over m2, since staying on such a line is what conservation of momentum

82
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,480
looks like in this diagram.

83
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,340
And from here, you can fill in the rest for how the block collisions correspond to hopping

84
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,520
around the circle in our picture, where we keep going like this, until the velocity of

85
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,080
that smaller block is both positive and smaller than the velocity of the big one, meaning

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,940
they'll never touch again.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,120
That corresponds to this triangular region in the upper right of the diagram, so in our

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,020
process we keep bouncing until we land in that region.

89
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,300
What we've drawn here is called a phase diagram, which is a simple but powerful idea

90
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,120
in math where you encode the state of some system, in this case the velocities of our

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,760
sliding blocks, as a single point in some abstract space.

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,360
What's powerful here is that it turns questions about dynamics into questions about geometry.

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,600
In this case, the dynamical idea of all possible pairs of velocities that conserve energy corresponds

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,820
to the geometric idea of a circle, and counting the total number of collisions turns into

95
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:46,240
counting the total number of hops along these lines, alternating between vertical and diagonal.

96
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,300
But our question remains, why is it that when that mass ratio is a power of 100, the total

97
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,880
number of steps shows the digits of pi?

98
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,600
Well, if you stare at this picture, maybe, just maybe, you'd notice that all the arc

99
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,400
lengths between the points on this circle seem to be about the same.

100
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,800
It's not immediately obvious that this should be true, but if it is, it means that computing

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
the value of one such arc length should be enough to figure out how many total collisions

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,360
it takes to get us into that end zone.

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,280
The key here is to use the ever-helpful inscribed angle theorem, which says that whenever you're

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,440
forming an angle using three points on a circle, P1, P2, and P3, like this, it will be exactly

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,040
half of the angle formed by P1, the circle's center, and P3.

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,800
P2 can be anywhere on this circle, anywhere except between P1 and P3, and this lovely

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,620
little fact will be true.

108
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,240
So now look back at our phase space, and focus specifically on three points, like these.

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,660
Remember, that first vertical hop corresponds to the second block bouncing off the wall,

110
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,520
and that second hop, along a slope of negative square root of m1 over m2, corresponds to

111
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,400
a momentum-conserving block collision.

112
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's call the angle between this momentum line and the vertical line theta, and now

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,140
maybe you see it using the inscribed angle theorem, this arc length between those two

114
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,880
bottom points, measured in radians, will be 2 theta.

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,160
And importantly, since the momentum line has the same slope for all of those jumps from

116
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,780
the top of the circle to the bottom, the same reasoning means that all of these arc lengths

117
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,040
must also be 2 theta.

118
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,240
So for each hop, if we drop down a new arc, like so, then after each collision we cover

119
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,940
another 2 theta radians of the circle.

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,800
We stop once we're in the end zone on the right, which remember, corresponds to both

121
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,300
blocks moving to the right with the smaller one going slower.

122
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,240
But you can also think of this as stopping at the point when adding one more arc of 2

123
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
theta would overlap with the previous one.

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,400
In other words, how many times do you have to add 2 theta to itself before it covers

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,040
more than the whole circle, more than 2 pi radians?

126
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,360
The answer to this will be the same as the number of collisions between our blocks.

127
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,400
Or to say the same thing more compactly, what's the largest integer multiple of theta that

128
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,880
doesn't surpass pi?

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:15,120
For example, if theta was 0.01 radians, then multiplying it by as much as 314 would keep

130
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,520
you below pi, but multiplying by 315 would bring you over that value.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,680
So the answer would be 314, meaning if our mass ratio was one such that the angle theta

132
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:35,420
in our diagram was 0.01, then the blocks would collide 314 times.

133
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,280
So now you know what we need to do.

134
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,200
Let's go ahead and actually compute the value theta, say when the mass ratio is 100

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
to 1.

136
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,280
Remember, this rise over run slope of that constant momentum line was the negative square

137
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,560
root of m1 over m2, which in this example is negative 10.

138
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,280
That would mean that the tangent of this angle theta, opposite over adjacent, is the run

139
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,840
over the negative rise, so to speak, which is 1 divided by 10 in this example.

140
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,440
So theta is going to be the arctan of 1 tenth.

141
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Speaking more generally, it'll be the inverse tangent of the square root of the small mass

142
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,040
over the square root of the big mass.

143
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,320
If you plug these into a calculator, what you'd notice is that the inverse tangent

144
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,420
of such a small value is actually quite close to the value itself.

145
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,520
For example, arctan of 1 over 100, corresponding to a big mass of 10,000 kg, is extremely close

146
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
to 0.01.

147
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,000
In fact, it's so close that for the sake of our central question, it might as well

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
be 0.01.

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,800
What I mean by that is, analogous to what we saw a moment ago, adding this to itself

150
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,080
as many as 314 times won't surpass pi, but the 315th time would.

151
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,500
Remember, unraveling why we're doing all this, that's a way of counting how many

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,680
jumps on the phase diagram gets us into the end zone, which in turn is a way of counting

153
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,360
how many times the blocks collide until they're sailing off never to touch again.

154
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,280
So that, my friends, is why a mass ratio of 10,000 gives 314 collisions.

155
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Likewise, a mass ratio of 1,000,000 to 1 will give an angle theta equals the inverse tangent

156
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,140
of 1 over 1000.

157
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,880
This is extremely close to 0.001, and again, if we ask about the largest integer multiple

158
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,440
of this angle that doesn't surpass pi, it's the same as it would be for a precise value

159
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,680
of 0.001, namely 3,141.

160
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,520
These are the first 4 digits of pi because that is, by definition, what digits of a number

161
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
mean.

162
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,960
This explains why when the mass ratio is 1,000,000, the number of collisions is 3,141.

163
00:11:50,960 --> 00:12:00,120
And you might notice that all of this relies on the hope that the inverse tangent of a

164
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,840
small value is sufficiently close to the value itself, which is another way of saying

165
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,760
that the tangent of a small value is approximately that value itself.

166
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,060
Intuitively, there's a nice reason this is true.

167
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,160
If you look at a unit circle, the tangent of any given angle is the height of this triangle

168
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,120
I've drawn divided by its width, and when that angle is really small, the width is basically

169
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,120
1, the radius of your circle, and the height is basically the same as the arc length along

170
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,760
that circle.

171
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,520
By definition, that arc length is theta.

172
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,080
To be more precise, the Taylor series expansion of tangent of theta shows that this approximation

173
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,300
will have only a cubic error term.

174
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,540
For example, the tangent of 1,100 differs from 1,100 itself by something on the order

175
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,680
of 1,1,000,000.

176
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,640
So even if we were to consider 314 steps with this angle, the error between the actual value

177
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,100
of arctan 1 over 100 and the approximation of 0.01 just won't have a chance to accumulate

178
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,940
high enough to be as big as an integer.

179
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,120
So let's zoom out and sum up.

180
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,620
When blocks collide, you can figure out their new velocities by slicing a line through a

181
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,900
circle in a velocity phase diagram, where each of these curves represents a conservation

182
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,940
law.

183
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,320
Most notably, the conservation of energy is what plants that circular seed that ultimately

184
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,540
blossoms into the pi we find in the final count.

185
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,660
Specifically, due to some inscribed angle geometry, the points we hit of this circle

186
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,360
are spaced out evenly, separated by an angle we call 2 theta.

187
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,280
This lets us rephrase the question of counting collisions, as instead asking how many times

188
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,020
must we add 2 theta to itself before it surpasses 2 pi.

189
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,240
If theta looks something like 0.001, the answer to that question has the same first digits

190
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
as pi.

191
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,860
And when the mass ratio is some power of 100, because arctan of x is so well approximated

192
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,880
by x for small values, theta is sufficiently close to this value that it gives the same

193
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
final count.

194
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,260
I'll emphasize again what this phase space allowed us to do, because as I said, this

195
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,260
is a lesson useful for all sorts of math, like differential equations, chaos theory,

196
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,200
and other flavors of dynamics.

197
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,220
By representing the relevant state of your system as a single point in an abstract space,

198
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,760
it lets you translate problems of dynamics into problems of geometry.

199
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,460
I repeat myself because I don't want you to come away just remembering a neat puzzle

200
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,080
where pi shows up unexpectedly, I want you to remember this surprise appearance as a

201
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,020
distilled remnant of the deeper relationship at play.

202
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,500
And if this solution leaves you feeling satisfied, it shouldn't, because there is another perspective,

203
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,320
more clever and pretty than this one, due to Galperin in his original paper on this

204
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,240
phenomenon which invites us to draw a striking parallel between the dynamics of these blocks

205
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,200
and that of a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors.

206
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,920
Trust me, I've saved the best for last on this topic, so I hope to see you again in

207
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,640
the next video.
