00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,180
Last video I left you with a puzzle.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,840
The setup involves two sliding blocks in a perfectly idealized world where there's

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,520
no friction and all collisions are perfectly elastic, meaning no energy is lost.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,200
One block is sent towards another smaller one, which starts off stationary and there's

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,020
a wall behind it, so that the smaller block bounces back and forth until it redirects

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,720
the big block's momentum enough to fully turn around, sailing away from the wall.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,920
If that first block has a mass which is a power of 100 times the mass of the second,

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,580
for example a million times as much, an insanely surprising fact popped out.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,680
The total number of collisions, including those between the second mass and the wall,

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,200
has the same starting digits as pi.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,740
In this example that's 3141 collisions.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,480
If that first block was a trillion times the mass, it would be 3,141,592 collisions before

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,140
this happens.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,540
Almost all of which happen in one huge unrealistic burst.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,140
And speaking of unexpectedly big bursts, in the short time since that video went out,

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,860
lots of people have been sharing solutions and attempts and simulations, which is awesome.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,660
So why does this happen?

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Why should pi show up in such an unexpected place and in such an unexpected manner?

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,940
Foremost this is a lesson about using phase space, also commonly called configuration

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,400
space, to solve problems.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,900
So rest assured that you're not just learning about some esoteric algorithm for pi, this

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,280
tactic here is core to many other fields, and is a useful tool to keep in your belt.

23
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,080
To start, when one block hits another, how do you figure out the velocity of each one

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,980
after the collision?

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,920
The key is to use the conservation of energy together with the conservation of momentum.

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,640
Let's call their masses m1 and m2, and their velocities v1 and v2, which will be the variables

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,080
changing throughout the process.

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:00,300
At any given point, the total kinetic energy is ½ m1 v1² plus ½ m2 v2².

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,240
So even though v1 and v2 will be changing as the blocks get bumped around, the value

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,720
of this expression must remain constant.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,100
The total momentum of the two blocks is m1v1 plus m2v2.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
This also has to remain constant when the blocks hit each other, but it can change as

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,540
the second block bounces off the wall.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,040
In reality, the second block would transfer its momentum to the wall during this collision,

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,760
and again we're being idealistic, say thinking of that wall as having infinite mass, so such

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,060
a momentum transfer won't actually move the wall.

37
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,020
So here we have two equations and two unknowns.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,360
To put these to use, try drawing a picture to represent the equations.

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,380
You might start by focusing on the energy equation.

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,300
Since v1 and v2 are changing, maybe you think to represent the equation on a coordinate

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,020
plane where x is equal to v1 and y is equal to v2.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,880
So individual points on this plane encode the pair of velocities of our block.

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,020
In that case, the energy equation represents an ellipse, where each point of this ellipse

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,660
gives you a pair of velocities, all of which correspond to the same total kinetic energy.

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,360
In fact, let's change our coordinates a little bit to make this a perfect circle,

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,820
since we know we're on a hunt for pi.

47
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,700
Instead of having the x-coordinate represent v1, let it be the square root of m1 times

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,520
v1, which for this example stretches the figure in the x-direction by the square root of 10.

49
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,260
Likewise, have the y-coordinate represent square root of m2 times v2.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,700
That way, when you look at the conservation of energy equation, what it's saying is

51
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:43,100
½ x2 plus y2 equals some constant, which is the equation for a circle, which specific

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,780
circle depends on the total energy, but that doesn't matter for our problem.

53
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,760
At the beginning, when the first block is sliding to the left and the second one is

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,060
stationary, we're at the leftmost point on the circle, where the x-coordinate is negative

55
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,680
and the y-coordinate is zero.

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,740
What about right after the collision?

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,040
How do we know what happens?

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,560
Conservation of energy tells us that we must jump to some other point of the circle, but

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,080
which one?

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,940
Use the conservation of momentum.

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,240
This tells us that before and after the collision, the value of m1 times v1 plus m2 times v2

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,620
must stay constant.

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,260
In our rescaled coordinates, that looks like saying square root of m1 times x plus square

64
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,220
root of m2 times y equals some constant.

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,820
And that's the equation for a line, specifically a line with a slope of negative square root

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,320
of m1 over m2.

67
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,400
You might ask which specific line, and that depends on what the constant momentum is,

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,240
but we know that it must pass through our first point, and that locks us into one choice.

69
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,380
So just to be clear about what all this is saying, all other pairs of velocities which

70
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,380
would give the same momentum live on this line, in just the same way that all other

71
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,760
pairs of velocities that give the same energy live on this circle.

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,120
So notice, this gives us one and only one other point that we could jump to.

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,740
And it should make sense that it's something where the x-coordinate gets a little less

74
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,380
negative and the y-coordinate becomes negative, since that corresponds to the big block, which

75
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,920
is slowing down a little, while the little block zooms off towards the wall.

76
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,640
From here it's quite fun to see how things play out.

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,060
When the second block bounces off the wall, its speed stays the same, but it goes from

78
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,500
negative to positive, right?

79
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,800
So in this diagram, that corresponds to reflecting about the x-axis, since the y-coordinate gets

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,180
multiplied by negative 1.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,820
Then once more, the next collision corresponds to a jump along a line with slope negative

82
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,940
square root of m1 over m2, since staying on such a line is what conservation of momentum

83
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,860
looks like in this diagram.

84
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,320
And from here you can fill in the rest for how the block collisions correspond to hopping

85
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,560
around the circle in our picture, where we keep going like this, until the velocity of

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,080
that smaller block is both positive and smaller than the velocity of the big one, meaning

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
they'll never touch again.

88
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,700
That corresponds to this triangular region in the upper right of the diagram, so in our

89
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,140
region.

90
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,340
What we've drawn here is called a phase diagram, which is a simple but powerful idea

91
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,220
in math where you encode the state of some system, in this case the velocities of our

92
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,560
sliding blocks, as a single point in some abstract space.

93
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,660
What's powerful here is that it turns questions about dynamics into questions about geometry.

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,500
In this case, the dynamical idea of all possible pairs of velocities that conserve energy corresponds

95
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,800
to the geometric idea of a circle, and counting the total number of collisions turns into

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,880
counting the total number of hops along these lines, alternating between vertical and diagonal.

97
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,420
But our question remains, why is it that when that mass ratio is a power of 100, the total

98
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,200
number of steps shows the digits of pi?

99
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,760
Well, if you stare at this picture, maybe, just maybe, you'd notice that all the arc

100
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,160
lengths between the points on this circle seem to be about the same.

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,820
It's not immediately obvious that this should be true, but if it is, it means that computing

102
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,220
the value of one such arc length should be enough to figure out how many total collisions

103
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,460
it takes to get us into that end zone.

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,180
The key here is to use the ever-helpful inscribed angle theorem, which says that whenever you're

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,500
forming an angle using three points on a circle, P1, P2, and P3, like this, it will be exactly

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,960
half of the angle formed by P1, the circle's center, and P3.

107
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,840
P2 can be anywhere on this circle, anywhere except between P1 and P3, and this lovely

108
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,940
little fact will be true.

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,860
So now look back at our phase space, and focus specifically on three points, like these.

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,180
Remember that first vertical hop corresponds to the second block bouncing off the wall,

111
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,600
and that second hop, along a slope of negative square root of m1 over m2, corresponds to

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,420
a momentum-conserving block collision.

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,920
Let's call the angle between this momentum line and the vertical line theta, and now

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,260
maybe you see it using the inscribed angle theorem, this arc length between those two

115
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,000
bottom points, measured in radians, will be 2 theta.

116
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,240
And importantly, since the momentum line has the same slope for all of those jumps from

117
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,640
the top of the circle to the bottom, the same reasoning means that all of these arc lengths

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,740
must also be 2 theta.

119
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,320
So for each hop, if we drop down a new arc, like so, then after each collision we cover

120
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,240
another 2 theta radians of the circle.

121
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,880
We stop once we're in the end zone on the right, which remember corresponds to both

122
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,520
blocks moving to the right with the smaller one going slower.

123
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,060
But you can also think of this as stopping at the point when adding one more arc of 2

124
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,440
theta would overlap with the previous one.

125
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,440
In other words, how many times do you have to add 2 theta to itself before it covers

126
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,200
more than the whole circle, more than 2 pi radians?

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,540
The answer to this will be the same as the number of collisions between our blocks.

128
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,480
Or to say the same thing more compactly, what's the largest integer multiple of theta that

129
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,920
doesn't surpass pi?

130
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:15,160
For example, if theta was 0.01 radians, then multiplying it by as much as 314 would keep

131
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,900
you below pi, but multiplying by 315 would bring you over that value.

132
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,820
So the answer would be 314, meaning if our mass ratio was one such that the angle theta

133
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,340
in our diagram was 0.01, then the blocks would collide 314 times.

134
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,220
So now you know what we need to do.

135
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,100
Let's go ahead and actually compute the value theta, say when the mass ratio is 100

136
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,540
to 1.

137
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,300
Remember, this rise over run slope of that constant momentum line was the negative square

138
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,920
root of m1 over m2, which in this example is negative 10.

139
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,160
That would mean that the tangent of this angle theta, opposite over adjacent, is the run

140
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,080
over the negative rise, so to speak, which is 1 divided by 10 in this example.

141
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,440
So theta is going to be the arctan of 1 tenth.

142
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,200
Speaking more generally, it'll be the inverse tangent of the square root of the small mass

143
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
over the square root of the big mass.

144
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,320
If you plug these into a calculator, what you'd notice is that the inverse tangent

145
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,800
of such a small value is actually quite close to the value itself.

146
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:34,580
For example, arctan of 1 over 100, corresponding to a big mass of 10,000 kg, is extremely close

147
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,680
to 0.01.

148
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,840
In fact, it's so close that for the sake of our central question, it might as well

149
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,360
be 0.01.

150
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,640
What I mean by that is, analogous to what we saw a moment ago, adding this to itself

151
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,720
as many as 314 times won't surpass pi, but the 315th time would.

152
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Remember, unraveling why we're doing all this, that's a way of counting how many

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,720
jumps on the phase diagram gets us into the end zone, which in turn is a way of counting

154
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,720
how many times the blocks collide until they're sailing off to never touch again.

155
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,720
So that, my friends, is why a mass ratio of 10,000 gives 314 collisions.

156
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,940
Likewise, a mass ratio of a million to one will give an angle theta equals the inverse

157
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,340
tangent of 1 over 1000.

158
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,220
This is extremely close to 0.001.

159
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,920
And again, if we ask about the largest integer multiple of this angle that doesn't surpass

160
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,300
pi, it's the same as it would be for a precise value of 0.001, namely 3141.

161
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,560
These are the first four digits of pi because that is, by definition, what digits of a number

162
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,040
mean.

163
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,140
This explains why when the mass ratio is a million, the number of collisions is 3141.

164
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,260
And you might notice that all of this relies on the hope that the inverse tangent of a

165
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,040
small value is sufficiently close to the value itself, which is another way of saying that

166
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,580
the tangent of a small value is approximately that value itself.

167
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,500
Intuitively, there's a really nice reason this is true.

168
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,760
If you look at a unit circle, the tangent of any given angle is the height of this little

169
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,060
triangle I've drawn divided by its width.

170
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,600
And when that angle is really small, the width is basically 1, the radius of your circle,

171
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,300
and the height is basically the same as the arc length along that circle, and by definition

172
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,780
that arc length is theta.

173
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,400
To be more precise about it, the Taylor series expansion of tangent of theta shows that this

174
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,320
approximation will have only a cubic error term.

175
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,100
So for example, the tangent of 1 one hundredth differs from 1 one hundredth itself by something

176
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,940
on the order of 1 one millionth.

177
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,500
So even if we were to consider 314 steps with this angle, the error between the actual value

178
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,100
of arc tan 1 over 100 and the approximation of 0.01 just won't have a chance to accumulate

179
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,700
high enough to be as big as an integer.

180
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,980
So let's zoom out and sum up.

181
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,860
When blocks collide, you can figure out their new velocities by slicing a line through a

182
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,860
circle in a velocity phase diagram, where each of these curves represents a conservation

183
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,240
law.

184
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,360
Most notably, the conservation of energy is what plants that circular seed that ultimately

185
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,960
blossoms into the pi that we find in the final count.

186
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,360
Specifically, due to some inscribed angle geometry, the points that we hit of this circle

187
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,520
are spaced out evenly, separated by an angle we were calling 2 theta.

188
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,320
This lets us rephrase the question of counting collisions, as instead asking how many times

189
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,960
must we add 2 theta to itself before it surpasses 2 pi.

190
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,240
If theta looks something like 0.001, the answer to that question has the same first digits

191
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,820
as pi, and when the mass ratio is some power of 100, because arc tan of x is so well approximated

192
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,920
by x for small values, theta is sufficiently close to this value that it gives the same

193
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,680
final count.

194
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll emphasize again what this phase space allowed us to do, because as I said, this

195
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,940
is a lesson useful for all sorts of math, like differential equations, chaos theory,

196
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,560
and other flavors of dynamics.

197
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,060
By representing the relevant state of your system as a single point in an abstract space,

198
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,060
it lets you translate problems of dynamics into problems of geometry.

199
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,460
I repeat myself because I don't want you to come away just remembering a neat puzzle

200
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,200
where pi shows up unexpectedly, I want you to remember this surprise appearance as a

201
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,880
distilled remnant of the deeper relationship at play.

202
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,140
And if this solution leaves you feeling satisfied, it shouldn't, because there is another perspective,

203
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,400
more clever and pretty than this one, due to Galperin and his original paper on this

204
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,840
phenomenon, which invites us to draw a striking parallel between the dynamics of these blocks

205
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,560
and that of a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors.

206
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,980
Trust me, I've saved the best for last on this topic, so I hope to see you again in

207
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,640
the next video.
